1,05/08/2017,Disappointing The actual product came out looking much different than the online rendering.,4002178_W
1,04/10/2017, These shoes look nothing like the picture! I expected a grey color...they aren't grey at all..more like cream..I'm so disappointed that I spent so much money on a pair of shoes that I hate and can't return.,4002178_W
1,02/26/2017,color sample was way off I ordered this shoe because i loved the displayed blush pink color. However when I ordered them they came out much more of a neon salmon color and it was nothing like I expected. I would have never ordered the shoe if the online color was portrayed more accurately. I'm very dissapointed. The neon of the shoes don't totally show up in the picture i took but you can still tell it is far off from the online sample.,4002178_W
5,09/15/2017,awesome sneakers They are comfortable sneakers for working out and running.,4002179_W
1,07/30/2017,"Too bulky & squeaky I got all black with white soles and they look very nice, I have gotten a lot of compliments on them. But I am very disappointed with the quality for how much I paid. The soles are much bigger than represented and for some reason the sole of my right shoe makes a loud squeak and it will not go away!! It's like it starts sticking to the ground and squeaks. Idk how to fix it! If anyone knows how to please reply.",4002179_W
3,06/26/2017,Too bulky The sole is larger than whats represented . Looks very bulky. Not what was expected and dont like them.,4002179_W
4,06/11/2017,great purchase Not use to buying bright colour trainers but these are gorgeous.,4002179_W
5,09/23/2017,Best runing shoes ever!!! This is unikale shoes!I run whit them in alle seasons!eaven in snow!600 km we run together. I need fore new one....but ...tooooo expensive :(,4002255_W
3,12/01/2017,"The shock red looks more pink. I know that's my fault, but i can't wear them with any of my KU shirts or shorts like i intended. The shoes were great the shock red on my computer looked red, but in person looks more pink.  Worn once and boxed them back up.  It was my fault for not checking more into ""shock red""",4002435_W
1,11/30/2017,NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WAS ORDERED! The design and the actual item has a massive difference and the quality feels so poor. Big waste of money.,4002435_W
4,11/12/2017,Love the colors and designs! Why can't I have my name written on the shoe? I would love it if you can have my name tag on the shoe.,4002435_W
4,11/02/2017," I wish these were as comfortable as my standard Superstar Adidas, but they are not. The shoe feels hard when I walk in them. More cushion please! Otherwise, it's a cool shoe, no doubt!",4002435_W
4,11/02/2017,Nice looking shoe They are much narrower than my old superstars so I was disappointed. They're still comfortable though.,4002435_W
2,10/23/2017,"not true customization when mi adidas first came out for shelltoes, you could really get them any way you liked. now there are some limitations that don't make sense, and i can no longer get shoes i have ordered previously. so i don't order from here anymore. i've spoken with customer service about this many times, to no avail. i continue to check back to see if things have changed and continue to be disappointed. i was a dedicated lifelong customer and now i no longer buy shoes from adidas.",4002435_W
5,10/16/2017,They look just like i expected great! Comfortable nice fitted colors are very well and leather,4002435_W
5,10/07/2017,"I like them! I just wish you guys made this customizable feature for the Addidas Matchcourt! I would buy so many! Nice and comfy, but them matchcourts tho! Please add a matchcourt to the mix.",4002435_W
3,09/04/2017,What happened to all the great customized options? No more suede or snakeskin! These options are boring and can be bought in stores already. I was looking forward to getting my suede shoes :(,4002435_W
1,08/31/2017,Lack of colour options Adidas Superstar RT colour options are very poor they need to add more colour options to their tongue logo/superstar logo & sock liner.,4002435_W
5,08/29/2017,I get compliments every time i wear them. People dont believe I custom designed them. My shoe looka exactly like I designed. Only thing i wish I could do is change colors of each stripe. Also i wish there was more variety in colors. Im making another pair now!,4002435_W
1,08/23/2017," Terrible, nothing like what the app leads you to believe. Do NOT waste your money & time",4002435_W

5,06/08/2017,"Thanks for making a 41 year old look relevant. Well made, timely delivered and great customer service.",4002435_W
2,06/07/2017,"Unsatisfied due to manufacturing error I ordered these to wear in the Pride Parade because I always wear Adidas in the parade. I ordered gold metallic stripes and a gold metallic tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar 80s. Somehow they made a manufacturing error and put the Black Gold tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar RTs. Also, the personalized engraving is so faint it's barely visible. Hopefully, Adidas will rectify this situation for me and then I will revise my review. But even then, I will never have a new pair on time to wear in the Pride Parade. Not good.",4002435_W

5,04/22/2017,Best shoes ever Because they cute n confirmation. They very good they fit very well and they make me look fly I guess,4002435_W
5,04/14/2017,"Quality shoes and materials Good Quality, what you expect is what you will get.. QUALITY. The only downside is lack of choices of materials, colors and stuff.",4002435_W
4,04/12/2017,"Great product but more options needed! Great product, but i really wish there was a much bigger customization range in superstars. more colors and different ire-decent options would be good along with image placement and names/text on RT model. other than that a really great product. x3 pairs purchased customized in one go =) Adidas email me to discuss ideas, i am willing to help.",4002435_W

5,04/06/2017,nicely amazing how I can get it with my name in the back of desig,4002435_W
4,04/06/2017,"Pretty much what you see, just don't get the monogram. The shoe is pretty much exactly what I wanted. The problem I have though (and it's a pretty big one to me) is, the monogram is much smaller than shown and barely visible. What I wanted printed on the shoe is for my wedding day, and you can barely see it. .",4002435_W
5,03/31/2017,Perfect i always get much more than what i expect from adidas yet this has been one of my best order.,4002435_W

1,02/25/2017,"Not happy with the colour The colour of the trainer that's arrived is a totally different to what was designed. I'm happy with everything apart from the colour! The colour on the website is a dark navy, this colour is not the same its lighter. Not happy, I love adidas products but this was a real let down.",4002435_W
1,02/24/2017, i don't like it because the are terrible shoes boll,4002435_W
1,02/24/2017,"Sad Wait, what happened to all the super nice options for the superstars last year? Now only the Stan smiths can be properly customized?",4002435_W
3,02/01/2017,breast cancer survial the shoe is a stlyish urban brand for the hood just right for any age.,4002435_W
4,01/20/2017," Nice. I do love the ""Scarlet"" color. However, not a huge fan of the toe matching the base. It doesn't quite look right, and the difference in materials seems to be the reason. I love the chunky, rounded aesthetic of the toe, but personally, I wish the toe material matched the base material for a more uniform look. This is probably fine if you prefer to keep the toe linked to the outsole, and not the base as I wanted to.",4002435_W
3,01/19/2017,"what about purple, yellow, orange, green or any other colors theres not enough colors to choose from and why can't i get the tounge logo to match the stripes? plus the stupid nickname",4002435_W
5,01/18/2017,Just right for me. Just right for me. Love to be able to express myself.,4002435_W

3,09/11/2017, very comfortable but after about a month they were starting to fall apart,4002556_M
2,10/19/2017," Beautiful looking sneaker, I designed my own color, so paid an extra $40 I think, something like that ...
I feel like I am wearing duck feet they are so wide, I am a true 8.5 and these are not true to size, they are more like a 9, there is WAY TOO MUCH ROOM in this sneaker, so disappointing, If I can return them I will 
On the positive, very light weight, comfortable, quality is good. 
The box they came in was DESTROYED !!!!!! not much care in packaging to send out",4002556_W
5,09/26/2017, yes i would recommend this product. its very comfortable and great for running.,4002556_W
5,08/18/2017,Fantastic So comfy. Just fantastic. Would recommend to everyone. They are white.. and they are shoes.,4002556_W
3,08/15/2017,"too small It was the second pair of this model I have ordered in exactly the same size. The shoes, however, feel at least 1/2 size too small even though the first pair fits perfectly. Very disappointed as I'm not able to wear them and can't return them either.",4002178_M
5,07/10/2017, I used to love the Adios 2.0 and tried these and can't fault them either. I've done about 160 miles of running in them and will buy another pair when they're discounted on sale.,4002178_M
2,07/08/2017, Too tight around the toes. The most uncomfortable Adidas I have ever purchased.,4002178_M
5,06/22/2017,"Really quick and light, it's like you aren't wearing shoes I customised my own to match with my kit. It has my name in them too which I like. The main problem was picking the width, I contacted Adidas for advise and guidance on this and after a short period of conversing, they said they don't have a guide. I opted for the medium ones. These are really good, light and quick trainers, I am looking forward to racing in these. I have noticed small part of the sole has already fallen off after less than 50 miles.",4002178_M
2,05/23/2017,"Unhappy Not happy at all, definitely half a size too small which makes them unwearable, squashing my toes at the end.",4002178_M
4,05/22/2017,Great running shoe that's a bit too small. Size up 1/2 size Great running shoe that could be perfect my making the toe box a bit wider. Need to size up 1/2 size in order to get enough width.,4002178_M
5,05/13/2017,"Worth the money, glad I bought them This was my first custom shoe and I'm so happy I made the purchase. Very rare for me to find shows that fit do well, and the ability to do a unique design is fun.",4002178_M
5,03/31/2017, I found the shoes amazing and found it fun to costomize them,4002178_M
5,03/24/2017,"Best running shoes i've had in years I bought these shoes for casual wear but also to work out in occasionally. Used to run a lot, now I'm mostly higher intensity lift/crossfit where i need to more stability. I started doing more running to train for a race. Let me tell you, these shoes are light, feel great in just moderate runs and speed work. Huge fan. Will buy another pair. Oh, and i've gotten a lot of compliments on the shoe itself.",4002178_M
4,10/01/2017,A good choice to customize and wear. I like this because it's a product you design and it looks nice. Well done adidas :),4002179_M
1,08/16/2017,The green color of my shoe does not resemble the image at all I've ordered 5 custom shoes over the past 4 years and 3 of the 5 have not lived up to expectations. The green color of my most recent purchase looks nothing like the green presented on the site. Two of my other purchases had the bottom of the sneaker peel off within 2 weeks of use. The other 2 purchases I'm pleased with-,4002179_M
5,06/27/2017," i've had the mi Energy Cloud 2 weeks now, i customized them because i wanted to try the energy cloud tech and i really love the look of the trainers, i can say definitively these trainers incredibly comfortable and it's actually a really beautiful looking running shoes, i love it 10/10 for comfort",4002179_M
5,05/11/2017,"Love them They are really soft, you can feel how the show absorbs shock on a heel. A grip is perfect. They are really light. Perfect pair of shoes",4002179_M
5,09/28/2017,Best Buy Ever The best thing Adidas do is design your I have a great pair of trainers that are absolutely to my taste,4002435_M
5,09/10/2017,Most amazing shoe I have ever bought Absolutely love the product - customized it to match my start-up's colors and love them!!,4002435_M

5,08/07/2017,My Best Purchase Ever Its So Confortable And Light makes me feel way faster,4002435_M
5,08/05/2017,Great workout shoes I use these shoes for indoor use and they have great traction and surprisingly good support. I use them to play racquetball and have loved them. I also use them in the gym and they have been great. They are really flexible yet sturdy. Some of the most comfortable shoes I have owned.,GIV93
5,07/04/2017," very comfortable, the sole is the best part of the shoes",GIV93
5,07/04/2017,Awesome Very comfy shoe and it's very stylish as well. Would recommend to anyone.,GIV93

5,05/31/2017, They are Very comfortable shoes. A little bigger then expected though,GIV93
4,04/24/2017,"Amazing shoe but dirty very very fast I love adidas and almost everything about this shoe. The one thing that I do not like is that these shoes are dirt magnets. The first day I wore them, I saw marks all over the shoe. Even when wearing them casually indoors, these shoes tend to get dirty very fast.",GIV93
5,04/19/2017,They are really good It is a really comfortable shoe that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys running. I really like the design  and there are also many different colour options,GIV93
4,04/05/2017," Very comfortable and good looking shoes, great support for a good run.",GIV93
5,03/10/2017,"Very good value Very comfortable, reliable, and attractive shoes. The material used is a bit thin and flimsy and they get dirty quite easily, but I still think these shoes are worth picking up, especially in this colorway",GIV93
3,03/05/2017, The colour is completely different to what is shown.,GIV93
4,03/01/2017,"To dirty get black READ THIS! Thes shoes get so dirty so easily. DO NOT BUY TGIS COLOR. I naught these and when I pulled them out of the box and put them on, my sick left a dirt mark on the front of the shoe. So I thought I'll just clean it. Wrong! The tiniest bit of water will leave nasty brown marks in the shoe. These shoes are awesome, comfy, and only reflect on the back tab. I have friends that have pearchesed gray and black on white, and gray reflect well and stay clean while black on white look awesome and they stay clean too",GIV93
2,02/24/2017,Do not buy I am a size 13 and thought about using the 15% deal on your birthday so I bought a pair of the alphabounce HPCs and was not very impressed when I tried them on and they were too big and too wide for my foot and I have a fairly wide foot so I'm going to try a 12.5 and hope they fit like 13s. I would not recommend buying these. I definitely liked the nmds fit much more.,GIV93
4,02/03/2017,Best shoes i got I love the shoe. But they get dirty very easily. I'm wondering if any can help me by telling me how to clean them.,GIV93

4,01/03/2017,"would buy again great buy! I would recommend to anyone, just hope that there are more colours in UK",GIV93
5,01/02/2017," I really like the Alphabounce design, although the white color didn't turn out like I expected it to be, I thought it will be the prefect white with silver shine or something like that.",GIV93
5,12/24/2016,Best shoe around I bought this for my son and he found it the most comfy shoe ever. We bought a 1/2 size larger than usual because the other reviews told us too and it fits great.,GIV93
5,12/13/2016,Such a great shoe Really comfortable and great on feet. Would reccomend,GIV93
4,12/05/2016,solid must have you will not want to put these down This shoe is bouncy and keeps you bouncing all day very nice shoe i even left my nike shoes theses are great!,GIV93
4,11/28/2016,"Good buy , but keep clean I liked this show but very hard to keep clean and wash",GIV93
5,11/26/2016,"Unique, comfortable, sturdy. More firm than the ultra boosts but still extremely comfortable, I love the textured look and they turn heads! Great pair of kicks.",GIV93
5,11/25/2016,Awesome purchase This shoe is awesome I have revived many compliments and they are good for running the white and grey get dirty very easy though,GIV93
4,11/19/2016,Best adidas shoe right now I love the look and comfort of the shoe but it is a half size to big and the materials are hard to clean if you watch out were you step and order the correct size amazing shoe.,GIV93
4,11/18/2016,Remarkably comfy to walk in. Shoes look A little different in person uncertain of the style,GIV93
4,11/17/2016,"Great looking shoe. Lovely looking shoe, I'm not a runner, bought them because I liked the look of them. They aren't as comfortable as Ultraboosts, but nothing is really. The material used is like a breathable neoprene, so it is very soft and stretchy. The shoes are slightly narrow, so if you have wide feet, maybe order your normal Adidas size.",GIV93
4,11/17/2016," Trainers are perfect, I have knee problems so struggle to get comfy footwear for training but these are really good so far, they seem well made but only used them a few times, would recommend",GIV93
5,11/16/2016,Nice style good price Bought these for my 16 year old son .He regularly buys training shoes and said that these were the most comfortable he'd ever bought .,GIV93
1,10/22/2016,Did not match my needs and look Picture looked better than actual. Did not feel it,GIV93

5,10/20/2016,"Bright, light and comfortable. My new favorite running shoe. I have the light gray, which shows up very well in low light road running. The material that surrounds your foot has a glove like   feel. Very comfortable, like the first bounce shoes did.",GIV93

5,09/22/2016, Love the style of these  Alphabounce boots and they certainly do giv you that added bounce when shooting hoops,GIV93
5,09/19/2016,Unique looking shoes . Perfect Very unusual looking shoes but unique just the same . Great for running,GIV93
5,09/18/2016,I'm buying ten pairs of these shoes I like it in every way if I told you all of them it would take forever to read.,GIV93
5,09/13/2016, Very great feeling but too bad size don't fit. Would like to purchase next time.,GIV93
4,09/11/2016,Extremely comfortable shoe Love the shoe love the company but was way too big I'm a size 11 for everything I would I had to drop to at least a 10 1/2. Plus the picture really makes it look like they're white and they definitely are not,GIV93
5,09/11/2016,Worth it The way tbe shoe is made is just PERFECT really comfy,GIV93
3,09/10/2016,Let down Shoe fits very well on the foot however the does not grip on the back. Nothing to do with size as the size was perfect. Not perfect for people with slim ankles,GIV93
1,09/05/2016, its pretty lit overall.......................................,GIV93
5,09/04/2016,"Super style and excellent functionality. Very comfortable and great stability. Upper material is not suited for outdoor use, but a perfect gym shoe.",GIV93

5,08/22/2016,"good purchase, lightweight and good for running! very good, wanted to give a try as nice looking shoe and pleasantly suprised.",GIV93
5,08/21/2016,"amazing shoes Incredibly comfortable, nice fim cushion, not super soft like the ultra boost. Excellent for running, walking, gym/workout, and casual wear. This shoe is the whole package! Fits true to size. Adidas just needs to come out with more colourways.",GIV93
5,08/20/2016,Best purchase ever. The shoes are so comfortable. The size fit great. I love them shoe.,GIV93
4,08/18/2016,"Would recommend for running, aesthetics but not for hours of walking. I would say these shoes aesthetically look amazing! I'm a Personal Trainer and found these shoes to be uncomfortable after 2 hours of use. My feet starting to get sore, I do have flat feet so that doesn't help. I only use them for walking purposes as I'm back and forth in the gym. These shoes are meant for running so just for that type of use they would probably be amazing as they have a really nice firm bounce/response to them.
If you are looking for a nice looking shoe, def would recommend these. In terms of wearing them for hours on end, I don't think they will fill the role of a ""comfort shoe"".",GIV93
4,08/17/2016,It isn't ultra boosts but it's not a trashy shoe either. It looks really nice and is really versatile meaning that you can wear it casually as well as to work out.,GIV93
2,08/12/2016,Ultra boost is better Ultra boost is still the best. I don't like the fit of the shoes because I have a wide foot.,GIV93
5,08/11/2016,So comfortable! Great shoes! I thought the colour was more white as in the pictures but it turned out to be a little on the grey side. Should have read the Colour details.,GIV93
5,08/11/2016,Perfect day to day shoe Great shoe. Very comfortable. Haven't worn for running as I stick with energy boost but I recommend as a lifestyle or gym shoe. More colourways needed though,GIV93
5,08/07/2016,The shoes is comfy to run with. one of the best purchased i have i a long time. Good buy.,GIV93
4,08/06/2016," People with slightly wider feet may want to go a half size up as these shoes are very snug and wrap around your foot for a secure sock like fit, overall it is a good comfortable shoe with good support with amazing cushioning from the Bounce material in the mid-sole. The mesh on the upper feels very soft to the touch and seems thick enough for it to be durable. However, as this has a material which appear to be hard to clean once it gets dirty so I would recommend applying some protective spray on it to keep it looking fresh!",GIV93

4,08/11/2017,"A little big I am consistently an Adidas size 7 (I currently own 4 pairs).  This shoe, however, fit too big for me. Very roomy in the toe and little ankle support (but this may be because the shoe was too big).  I did run a 10k in these and they are super comfortable. They also look great!  I prefer my Boost 2.0's from 2 years ago though!",GJX55

3,07/26/2017,"Disappointed I read the reviews and the specs, and expected super comfort. Unfortunately, that comfort level did not materialize. Not enough cushioning in the ball of the foot area, and after a couple of hours the heel area of my foot was not comfortable. I hesitate recommending the shoe, as I may be an outlier in the comfort area.",GUA47
5,06/16/2017," Pretty stylish and flexible runner, breathable, and very very bouncy.  One of my most comfortable sneakers.",GUA47
5,06/15/2017," Very comfortable, bought a second pair. One pair for work and one for the gym. So far been wearing one pair to work 5 days a week for a few​ months now and no issues with the quality so far. No complaints!",GUA47
5,05/26/2017,Favorite shoe under 100 for sure Love the feeling of the bounce cushion. Helps absorb shock but still responsive,GUA47
4,03/03/2017,#noopnions2017 They're cool. Went jogging in them a few times. UBs are obviously more comfortable but for 100$ I'll take these over roshes any day!,GUA47
5,01/11/2017,"BEST 100 DOLLARS I HAVE EVER SPEND, THESE SHOES ARE WORTH IT!!! I love these shoes they are stylish and comfortable",GUA47

5,11/28/2016, Nice fit. Very easy to put on... great for running,GUA47
4,11/25/2016,They seem good but are bigger than expected. I'm in the navy and ordered these (size 10.5) online and got them just in time before I go out to sea. But to my dismay they are actually bigger than 10.5 and now I don't have time to return them and get a smaller version. Kind of annoying. I'll be sending these back and going to the mall now. Fix the sizes!,GUA47
2,11/22/2016,"Great shoes, bad quality. Great pair of shoes, they're incredibly comfortable and look good. However, after a month a half they started making an obnoxious noise while walking. For that alone I give these shoes a poor rating.",GUA47
5,11/19/2016,"Very underrated and versatile sneaker. Amazing shoe, very versatile. I used them for cross country and normal streetwear. Look great with both shorts and jeans. I've gotten multiple compliments and people asking me where I got them. Can't go wrong for $100.",GUA47
5,11/17/2016,"Best bang for your buck This shoe is amazing. I own an ultraboost shoe and of course comfort is the best. This is not far behind. I got the triple black and it is good as running shoe,trainer and casual wear. I was skeptical on going down half a size. But listen to what e are saying, if you have a normal to narrow foot, go a half size down. It felt tight as first but after an hour, it fit like a glove because the upper stretches to your foot.",GUA47
4,11/11/2016,"Good Fit. A good fit for my classes for the gym, and for balance.",GUA47
5,11/08/2016,A little narrow but their fine to wear all day Great shoe I have 2 pair one for work and the multi color for going out...love my purchase. Great price and just a great shoe.,GUA47

4,11/01/2016,Good purchase for a pair shoes Nice design and affordable too. Not too pricey....,GUA47
5,10/31/2016, These shoes are more comfortable than my pure boost shoes. Perfect for cross training.,GUA47
1,10/29/2016,Bvcf Dont fit blister terrible uncomfortable lameeeeee ?,GUA47
5,10/28/2016,They are simply perfect I was hesitant at first when I saw them online. But fell in love when I saw them in person. Then I completely fell for them when I put them on.,GUA47
5,10/28/2016,"Bounce is the New BOOST At first I wasn't so sure about the ""Bounce"" technology, its amazingly responsive when you walk.",GUA47

4,10/27/2016,"great runner, 1/2 size too big as everyone knows the shoe looks great and performs even better. the only issue is that it runs a 1/2 size long. get a half size down and you are set. great running shoe",GUA47
5,10/27/2016,"worth the money the style of the sneaker is one of the best but they are also very comfortable, whether you're wearing them around town or working out in them these sneakers will always be a go to.",GUA47

4,10/22/2016,"Great purchase, I highly recommend this shoe. I like the style and comfort on this shoe, fits perfect and very comfortable to train and walk around in.",GUA47
5,10/22/2016,"Shoes delivered as promised I was lucky to get these shoes because supply was running low before I discovered them and then circled around to make the purchase a couple of days later. I personally feel they look terrific, not overly ornate, just striking a good aesthetic and utilitarian balance. They are comfortable and of good quality. Purple is a hard colour to pull off on any piece of male clothing, but you can accessorize around these shoes and not look like a clown. In short, I feel good in these shoes, and they feel good on my feet. Objective attained.",GUA47
5,10/21/2016,If you have wide feet my be a little uncomfortable for you. Very smooth and comfortable with a super clean look,GUA47

5,10/16/2016,Comfortable shoe Most comfortable running shoe I've owned. Simple yet stylish. Great shoe.,GUA47
5,10/16/2016,"Outstanding Adidas really outdid themselves with these shoes. They look better in person than online, they fit amazingly, and they are multi purpose. They're stylish enough to be used to go out, comfortable enough to be a daily shoe, and they're actually inspiring. When I put them on they make me want to run. I've only had one other shoe that made me feel that ever. The material is durable and stain resistant yet light and airy. Amazing job. I'm going to buy two more pairs in different colors.",GUA47
5,10/16/2016,If it came in more colors id have them also! Great shoe and great feel on foot. I would definitely recommend,GUA47

5,10/03/2016,Great style Bought one pair knew very soon that I needed another pair so I bought my wife and me three more total of four pairs two each great bounce knees going to get most protection,GUA47
5,10/03/2016,Sooooooooo comfortable. I might get flamed for this but honestly...Alphabounces are more comfortable then any boost shoe I have worn. The shoe fits like a glove...it looks sporty and the pricing is simply unbelievable. Alphabounce>Ultraboost>NMD in my opinion,GUA47
5,10/01/2016," Very comfortable to walk around, the toe box feels soft around your toes. the only thing is that this shoe may fit little narrow.",GUA47

5,09/28/2016,To be honest most comfortable shoe ever !!! Best shoe ever to be honest! Loved it ! I use to love nike now thinking about it twice,GUA47
4,09/27/2016,"Adidas comfort is unmatched. I have been an adidas customer for quite some time and you guys continue to give us great products. Pure boost, ultraboost, stan smith, and now the alphabounce. Great shoes. I just wish I could get my hands on a pair of yeezy boost, it is very difficult to secure a pair due to the popularity and people using ATC services. I would love to add those shoes to my collection of great adidas products. I used to wear other brands and now I strictly wear the three stripes.",GUA47
5,09/27/2016," Comfortable and great looking shoes. Had some pain from the left shoe rubbing against ankle joint that lasted four days until the shoe stretched out. I've decided that it's not a serious problem and it may have just been that one shoe. Overall, I'm very happy.",GUA47
5,09/27/2016,Solid Purchase!! They are so comfortable! And they look so good!! Overall a killer sneaker!!,GUA47
5,09/25/2016,Comfort is unbelievable I use this shoe for work since I'm on my feet all day and it's perfect. Usually I buy a different brand of shoe and it usually takes a few days to break in and these were comfy straight out the box! I will never buy anything but alphabounce for work.,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,Definetly worth the price. Very stylish. Everyone at my school thought they were cool. Very comfortable for about 12 hours then you start to feel the pressure on the side of your foot and the ball of your foot. The grip on the bottom of the shoe wears away a bit but other than that they are pretty durable and underrated.,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,Extremely flexible shoes. Some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn for working out. These shoes are not stiff. They are very flexible and allow your feet to bend naturally in any way. This makes them perfect for running.,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,"Stealthy and aggressive look The overall appearance is stealth-like. I purchased the all black pair. They look terrific. I run 12 in Nikes and I know Nike runs a bit big so I got 11.5 for Adidas. The shoes fit incredibly snug. The safari print is very subtle so it does not look too girly. 

I am taking one star off because of the neoprene material they used. Neoprene as a material similar to that of a surf suit. I've just had the pair a week, but I feel it is a type of material that will fade in the sun and get frayed when I am doing more of my intensive workouts. 

Again, the shoe is amazing as a whole. I am just a little weary of the top portion material choice. 

Lastly, Adidas, make these in Orange, or Red, or military colors. They'd look AMAZING!",GUA47
5,09/23/2016,"perfect shoe for comfort style and doesn't hurt the pocket. Besides the amazing fresh new design , the comfort is amazing. I own some of the Ultra boosts and although the bounce doesn't have Boost , it's really up there in terms of the comfort. And the price tag is even more amazing. All shoes should cost this much lol",GUA47
5,09/23/2016,Best runner in my opinion. Planning on buying another pair. Best runners i have ever bought. They are comfy and great for work!,GUA47
5,09/23/2016,Excellent value !!! What a great running shoe for the price ! This is what the ultra boost should have been. The Alphabounce is a real comfortable shoe with nice rebound. These are  a more firm feel compared to any shoe with the Boost material but they have a good feel of their own. The upper seamless material is very comfortable. Not as restrictive as the techfit in the 1st and 2nd gen energy boost and not as tight as the ultra boost. It has just the right amount of secure and firm snug fit with out restricting the movement of your foot and it has a better vent system as well. I have 3 pairs of Alphabounce each in a different color,GUA47
4,09/22/2016,Best Walking Shoe I've Ever Had! 39mi 3 days Perfect Comfort! Just needs ventilation,GUA47
5,09/22/2016,"Awesome kicks for the low price. Yes, very nice style and comfort for the price of $100.",GUA47

5,09/17/2016,"upper could be lager the sole very comfortable ,I have to fine a Thin sock !Going with no sock. comfortable once you get them on, not for a hot day because of the material they don't breath !",GUA47
5,09/17/2016,The best shoes I have I like the product the shoes are very beautiful....,GUA47
5,09/16/2016," Fits like a glove, comfortable, good looking and well made.",GUA47
5,09/11/2016,"LOVE THIS SHOE!! I have long been a serious adidas fan and when I saw this shoe I had to try it. I wanted this shoe as a runner and a trainer and it did not disappoint. I've always used adidas specialty shoes for fencing using their fencing specific shoes for fencing training and competition. As a fencer and runner I put a lot of abuse on my feet so I always look to adidas for footwear. This she is excellent not just for its low price tag but for any shoe of any price. The support is perfect for me and the responsiveness and bounce I find to work well for me. A great shoe loved it so much I bought two pairs, one in the hard to find core black/crystal white aramis dot pattern and one in the core black metallic silver. I don't wear this as a lifestyle shoe but as a functional runner and trainer and even use for fencing practice. For me this shoe is simply excellent.",GUA47
5,09/10/2016,"Great purchase This shoe is so freaking comfortable, just awesome.",GUA47
4,09/10/2016,Surprising Comfortable and light. Very good for every day walking and training.,GUA47
4,09/08/2016,Pretty Solid Shoe! Great sneakers! They run about a 1/2 size big but they are extremely comfortable. I like the style of the shoe and I can't wait for other color ways. My only issue with the shoe is that the material gets dirty really quick. I chose the grayish color and I have so many stains on them from running. All black is my next choice,GUA47
5,09/02/2016,Great buy get one ASAP This shoe is pretty amazing for just a hundred dollars. Its very comfortable and looks great with most of my wardrobe,GUA47
5,08/31/2016,"Stylish and awesome! Head turner out of the box. I wore them to a performance in a room full of people and I got stopped 10 times before I could reach the stage. People wanting to know what kind of shoes they were, where did I get them, did the store have any more. The whole nine. My drummer took one off of my foot to get a closer look. Adidas has been on a roll with these new designs lately. I've purchased more Adidas in the last 4 years than I have in my life and I'm in my late 30s.",GUA47
5,08/28/2016,"Great product, would reccomand to anyone. I'm a size 11, but I decided to try the shoes in a size 10.5. To my surprise the shoes actually ""adapted"" to my foot. I could wear these all day, in fact I already do. These shoes are perfect for everyday life and running.",GUA47
4,08/28/2016,"Cool running shoes but can't get wet Comfortable, lightweight, durable. Perfect besides feet get soaked in the rain",GUA47
5,08/26/2016,Great shoe with style!!!!! Great fit like a glove. Very stylish!!!! All I get is compliments when I wear them. I wear them for sprints and interval workouts. Good price. I hope more unique color patterns are developed by adidas,GUA47
5,08/26/2016,"Great buy Very comfy perfect look, good buy, stylish and sturdy",GUA47
4,08/25/2016,"Good for daily use but not running Fit good and feel relaxed in them, I'd say there good for daily use",GUA47
5,08/24/2016,"Sneaker of the Year. the price point is unbeatable, the comfort is there, but most importantly-SWAG. these shoes are so sick. I saw 2 Chainz rocking them at the NBA Finals and had to get my hands on a pair. finally found a color way that spoke to me with the grey combo. These are legit running shoes, but stable enough for training and lifting. Overall super versatile because I wear them casually and get a lot of compliments.",GUA47
5,08/24/2016,Can't wait to buy another pair. Incredibly comfortable. Super stylish. Another fantastic shoe from Adidas! #3StripesForever,GUA47
5,08/24/2016," Purchased the grey pair and knew i needed to grab the black as well!
extremely comfy and have now turned into a everyday pair of shoes.
Highly recommend",GUA47
5,08/22/2016,"Awesome Shoe! Great Design and Function Great shoe, super comfortable! Interesting design and materials are fantastic - should hold up when running outside instead of on treadmills.",GUA47
5,08/21/2016,Can't believe they're only $100 These are some of my favorite shoes right now! They are super comfortable and I can wear them casually even if I'm walking long distances. I'm not really a runner; I got them more because I like how they look and I will definitely be buying another pair in another color. And the best part is they look beautiful in pictures but even better in person,GUA47
5,08/20/2016,Great product. These shoes look great and feel better. I'm thrilled with them.,GUA47
5,08/20/2016,Second best purchase ever. First is the American Eagle Fighter Pilot T Shirt on Amazon This shoe is dope!!!!! Runs a little long though...,GUA47
2,08/18/2016,"Try it out in a store. These shoes are SUPER tight and uncomfortable, really, additional the material is super hot.",GUA47
5,08/15/2016,"So far so good. We will see how they hold up. I've only had them a week or two. Mostly wear them in the gym, not outside. They're very comfortable and the neoprene seem to absorb  the sweat then, it seems to evaporate. Love the bouncy cushion. Great for running reducing impact on ball of the foot. Conforms nicely to your feet for great support.",GUA47
5,08/15/2016,One of the most underrated comfy shoes Great product especially for the price great quality mesh and a very comfortable shoe very underrated love the colorway too,GUA47
5,08/14/2016,"Redefined sneakers for me My experience with sneakers have always been the classic chunky cross trainers or running shoes. I decided to try something different and am so glad I did.

These shoes have helped me get back into exercising. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra bounce in your step but with hardly any weight. These were perfect for me to jog in, but also to wear to boxing where I found traditional sneakers too bulky.

These are now also my casual sneaker of choice because of how comfortable they are, plus I have gotten heaps of comments about how great they look (they look even better on person than in the pictures).

This is my first purchase with Adidas, and will definitely be my brand of choice from now on. I'll probably upgrade these when my running gets more serious (not sure about their support for long distances), but they are perfect for me now both for fitness and casual wear.

Fit true to size, I have quite wide feet and they fit me perfectly (US 13), for reference if I buy Nike I sometimes have to go the size up.",GUA47
4,08/13/2016,Best purchase I love this product but why it write made in china,GUA47
5,08/11/2016,Comfortable and stylish sneaker. I was in need of some running sneakers and these sneakers met my expectations and more. Very comfortable as well.,GUA47
4,08/10/2016,Perfect shoe for the price This was a very good product I just advise not to expect boost like comfort. Its comfortable I just hoped that with the NMDs and Ultraboost that the Alphabounce would use that new comfort tech. Neverthe less worth it and fits like a sock,GUA47
4,08/09/2016,No regrets pleased with purchase. fit very well and look good. not sure how the midsole will wear but we will see,GUA47
5,08/07/2016,"My favorite Adidas yet, perfect and comfort Great great shoe, perfect fit and total comfort especially the sole",GUA47
5,08/05/2016,Best footwear purchase in a long time! Amazing shoe! Highly recommend this to all my friends and family!,GUA47
4,08/05/2016,In my top 5 sneaker purchases of the month. One of the most comfortable shoes I own. No flaws that I can see.,GUA47
5,08/04/2016,Well worth the money The Shoes are great and are highly recommended. I can't get how comfortable and light they are. They fit perfectly into my feet without any problems. Overall great shoe,GUA47
5,08/04/2016,Best purchase so far I love the price and the aesthetic and the comfort,GUA47
4,08/04/2016," Nice shoes overall, would recommend this to everyone.",GUA47
5,08/03/2016,"Best shoe ive owned. Super comfortbale shoe, looks great, feels great and is worth every single penny.",GUA47
4,08/02/2016,"Perfect fit & comfort even for narrow feet Super comfortable sneakers, comparable to that of ultra boosts but for half the price!
Having narrow feet, I was worried about the neoprene-like upper being too wide or buckling when tightening the laces; but not a problem!  I can pull the laces as tight as possible but no bunching occurs and the shoes remain supportive, comfortable and no loss of performance.

The relatively flat profile of the sole lends itself to being more of a casual or training shoe.  I found the curved sole of the ultra boost uncaged particularly conducive to running and following my natural stride.   

Length fits true to size (despite other reviews suggesting they run a bit large) for me. 

Core black colourway is minimalist sleek ... but hopefully we get the ""Aramis"" black/white patterned drop here in Aus!!",GUA47
5,08/02/2016,"Way better than a Nike product. I would recommend this shoe to anyone who would prefers comfortably and style first. the shoe is perfect in every way, it has style, comfortably, good arch, and most of all a great price. I would rate this a 10 out of 10,  very good product, better than Nike.",GUA47
5,08/01/2016,Best shoe I've ever gotten I loved them they were awesome. I recommend getting them,GUA47
4,08/01/2016, Comfy and feel like a good training shoe. Quality seems good.,GUA47
5,08/01/2016,"Couldn't be better Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. They feel amazing both in the sole and the exrerior material around the foot. High quality, and looks fire too.",GUA47
5,08/01/2016, Excellent. I teally recomend them.  I like them so much,GUA47
5,07/30/2016,"Great shoe for the price. Underrated. Runs a little big. I had to size down 1/2 size. Other than that great shoes. Great silhouette, very comfortable, looks good with both shorts and jeans. Sock and no socks. for $100 you can't go wrong.",GUA47
5,07/30/2016, Great shoe for running or even everyday wear. Bounce cushioning is great.,GUA47
2,07/29/2016, Get uncomfortable after a few hours of l standing in them,GUA47
4,07/28/2016, Good quality product. Wish the cushion would be more responsive while walking.,GUA47
5,07/23/2016,"Comfortable Good for walking , running an all around shoe. Pleasing to the eye and attractive.",GUA47
3,07/22/2016,Heavy on your feet but looks great and comfortable. I'm not the biggest fan of these shoes after my purchase. I really like the way they look and how comfortable they are. I did not however expect them to be as heavy as they feel. I prefer my running shoes to be light so next time I might go with a pair of adizero.,GUA47
5,07/20/2016,Amazing shoe I absolutely love this shoe. When i first saw it i was impressed at the build and quality. It had me itching to spend my money and i hate spending money. Now i couldn't be happier.,GUA47
5,07/19/2016,"Great purchase I originally bought the shoes, because I liked the style. Turns out they ran a little big so I had to send them back and get a smaller size. It was well worth it they are extremely comfortable and stylish. I love the fact that Adidas has came on strong.",GUA47
5,07/18/2016,"I went up half a size because mine was out; if that tells you anything :) The feel is great. I really love how light, but supportive they feel.",GUA47
3,07/18/2016, Light & Comfortable but the mesh material stretches so the sneakers do not stay as tight as I like them to be and they aren't water repellent. just a little bit of water and your feet get soaked.,GUA47
5,07/17/2016,"Best shoe ever! These alpha bounce shoes are very comfortable and lightweight. I bought a men's 8 since that's what I have in other adidas and I thought they might be a little too big at first, but after breaking in they're great.",GUA47
5,07/17/2016,"My favorite shoe This is such a great shoe for many reasons. Firstly the design is what attracts people but it is so much more. The shoe fits like a glove, the interior grips your foot perfectly almost like a sock and feels very stable and firm on the feet. The overall feel of the shoe is very comfortable so if you are worried about the fit, don't be. This is a complete masterpiece of a shoe and it is what we come to expect from adidas, all from a very affordable price.",GUA47
5,07/16/2016,"perfect combo of style, comfort and performance probably the single most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever purchased. Light but really well-cushioned.",GUA47
5,07/15/2016," Is really good shoe and comfortable and light, I have a bad ankle and this shoes work just perfect.",GUA47
4,07/15/2016,Look great and feel even better. They feel great...................................,GUA47
4,07/13/2016,"Highly recommend these awesome shooes I really do like these shoes a lot. Extremly comfortablecomfortable, and my feet can breathe easily. My only complaint is that they don't make them in wide sizes. So my pink toeye feels crunched most of the time.",GUA47
5,07/11/2016,"Good buy Very comfortable, great look, good quality, just all around good shoe",GUA47
4,07/11/2016,The best deal you'll get for your dollar Super comfy durable shoe! Just as comfortable as the nike prestos or roshes.,GUA47
4,07/10/2016,There good The shoes are extremely comfortable but only after a couple days or wear the coloring started to come off on the outside of the sole,GUA47
5,07/10/2016,truly best purchase i have ever made I have bought many Adidas shoes over the years. These alpha bounce are by far the best. I walk 6 to 10 miles a day on my job and I have to keep great quality shoes on my feet. With Adidas on my feet I never worry about bone spurs or hurting feet again. Thank you Adidas for your commitment to quality and satisfaction that to me far exceeds any other brand!!!!,GUA47
4,07/10/2016,"Comfortable everyday shoe The fused upper mesh is actually more of a neoprene material and is one solid piece that does hug your foot like a sock. It's comfortable, but doesn't breathe much. I bought these for work use, not running. As an everyday shoe, they are excellent and comfortable. I'm on my feet 10+ hours a day and they are perfect for long shifts. By, I would imagine that I would sweat quite a bit if I used them as my main running shoes.",GUA47
5,07/10/2016, They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned,GUA47
5,07/09/2016,Best bang for your buck Great shoe at a great price. Very comfortable and stylish. They do run a little big I'd say about a half size. Try them on if you can. I wear a 14/15 and wish I got the 14 instead of the 15 but they still fit well with a little wiggle room. Not really sure how they perform because I have them for casual use at the moment. Would buy 5 more pairs without a doubt. More colors soon please adidas! Great job as always.,GUA47
5,07/08/2016,"Great shoe, fits true to size. Mad comfortable. Great shoe, I usually wear 13, these in 13 fit great with just a smidge of extra room in the toe. I have narrow feet so the width is good for me, could be tough on a wide foot. Style is great, purple sole rocks. Oh, and super comfortable, right on par with the ultra boost in terms of comfort but has a unique feel to it.",GUA47
5,07/08/2016, They're one of the most comfortable and sturdy shoes I've owned.,GUA47
5,07/08/2016,"To date the Aphabounce is the best purchase I have made. Many shoes that I have tried on in the past that have a seamless upper, are either very hard to get on or once you get them on, there is too much space in certain areas. The adidas Alphabounce however is not only easy to get on, but fits extremely comfortably. On top of that, the soul is very comfortable for all activities.",GUA47
5,07/08/2016,Great price point on these sneakers. These are very light and comfortable. These shoes are at a great price point as well.,GUA47
5,07/08/2016,Amazing value! Great look! This shoe was something that I was not prepared to buy. But the price and the technology had me intrigued. No regrets whatsoever. Looks great and feels great!,GUA47
5,07/08/2016," Great shoe. The best running I've tried in years,better the over priced AirMax.",GUA47
5,07/08/2016,Th They are very comfortable they look good and clean easily are durable and good for running and working out,GUA47
3,07/07/2016, The sole look nice but the shape look too wide not in firm shape like ultra boost,GUA47
5,07/06/2016,"Not just fashionable, but good for actually RUNNING Decided to take these shoes for a long run to see how they'd hold up. 12 miles later, I was still feeling VERY comfortable in them. Quality shoe for a great price.",GUA47
4,07/06/2016,"On the right track could use minor improvements Comfortable, breathable, could improve traction on wet surfaces",GUA47
5,07/06/2016,Fashion meets comfort It looks good and fits like a sock a great buy adidas has done it again,GUA47
5,07/05/2016,"Incredibly comfy They aren't lying when they say bounce is a slightly firmer boost. Don't let the word firmer fool you, these shoes are very comfortable and very cushiony, they're terrific. They have a one piece upper so you can just slide them on and you could tie them, but I tucked the laces between the overlays on the shoe sides, and they still fit great",GUA47
5,07/04/2016,"Must Cop! I have flat feet so I sized up to a 15. Best thing I did these are lightweight, comfortable and stylish too. Very pleased with the purchase.",GUA47
5,07/03/2016,"It's really comfortable! Great design, comfortable, highly recommend because of the price",GUA47
4,07/03/2016,"Great looking shoe at a great price. Well made shoes that are light and fit perfectly.

The style is so unique too, which I also love. The cheaper price is also a plus too, sicnce its souch a comfy shoe that looks great. One of my favorite pairs of adidas to come out in years Wee Done guys!",GUA47
2,07/03/2016,Returned for new pair My pair had a defect. I returned them and hope this new pair feels better.,GUA47
5,07/02/2016,Best running shoes ever I love how comftorable these are there great for running.,GUA47
5,07/02/2016,"Comfy Shoes Shoes are comfy, just over time they build up with heat. Shoes do not have too much ventilation.",GUA47
5,07/02/2016,"Eye chaching, everyone comments on how great they look Very comfortable, good looking and good on golf course, running, walking or going to casual events. I now have a problem of what to do with the other running shoes I no longer want to wear.",GUA47
4,07/02/2016,"The price point is honestly the best part of these shoes. The Alpha Bounce is the first pair of adidas I have purchased in several years. After I stopped rocking shell toes I started collecting nike exclusively. I decided on the Alphas after seeing 2 chainz rocking a pair in Game 5 of the Finals. I purchased a 10.5 online and they are still sitting in the box they came in. I tried on a pair of 10s in store and realized the 10.5 is probably a half size too big. I chose the solar purple colorway and I love the look! I'm sure when  I finally wear them out they will receive great reactions. I loved the fit in store and the bounce was super comfortable. I don't have to tell anyone that the price on these is ridiculously affordable and I think I may grab another colorway before adidas decides to match nikes presto prices at 120! Grab a few pair of these while you can, they are great summer shoes and perfect for a early morning or late afternoon run!",GUA47
5,07/02/2016,A good purchase in my opinion. I like the shoes but the size was a little too big and I got my usual size and the shoe overall is a great shoe I love it.,GUA47
5,07/02/2016, Extremely comfortable shoes and very good quality. Surprised they're only $100. Another great product from Adidas.,GUA47
3,07/02/2016,Ahha idk The ultra boost are still a way better and more coder table running shoe.,GUA47
5,07/02/2016,"Most comfortable runner that I've worn. I really enjoy the Adidas Alphabounce. It was comfortable, affordable, and works well as a performance runner and a casual wear shoe. Thank you Adidas for another masterpiece.",GUA47
5,07/02/2016,As much bang for your buck as ultraboost No complaint other than they do run a 1/2 size big,GUA47
4,07/02/2016,Great debut for a new line of sneaker. They are very comfortable. The look gets compliments. Compared to my other Adidas these shoes are very long. The fit width-wise is very good and comfortable. The material for the upper feels cheap in hand. But all in all it was a good purchase I think.,GUA47
4,07/02/2016,As long as he likes them they're fine I bought these for my sixteen-year-old they were not his first choice the other ones were sold out but he likes these and if you get his first choice and I'll buy those too,GUA47
5,07/01/2016," Comfortable af. Haven't run in them yet, but great inthe gym. Cop em",GUA47
5,07/01/2016,Best running shoes I've ever had. They feel like I'm walking on clouds and they are incredibly beautiful.,GUA47
4,07/01/2016,"Good bang for your buck shoe! Good entry level running shoe. Adidas had me at $100! its definitely stylish and wearable besides just being a running shoe. Initially the forefoot cushioning feels great but as you get passed that, while running the lack of flexibility becomes an issue (if you crave a flexible runner this is probably not for you). Lastly get your true size, I went a half size up thinking they'd fit like ultra boost and I was wrong. The lack of heel support (locked in heel) in large part due to that 1.5 centimeter difference made for sloppy heel play during my run. Im beginning to think wearing my true size would make a difference in the overall performace of the shoe. These are 6/10 for Perfromance (not a heavy usage runner in my opinion) and an 8 of 10 in terms of style. Many thanks adidas!",GUA47
5,07/01/2016,"A lot of tech in this shoe for such an affordable price. It's a really clean looking shoe and it is very comfortable.

It's cushion is just like the name says 'bounce'.
The ultra boost is like having a memory foam only bed for your feet while the alphabounce is like having a mix of spring & memory foam.

Highly recommend this shoe. Don't sleep on them.",GUA47
2,06/23/2016,"would not recommend for any activty Below average. I received this shoe and was excited. But, my normal size 9 was too big. I needed an 8.5. The shoe is very unstable because of the material and very wide. I walked around but could not get over how unflattering these are and would never work out in these because of the fear I would injure my ankles. I am sure on someone these would be okay, but not for me. Returning.",GUA47
5,06/22/2016,Great looking comfortable Sneaker Awesome style and they are very comfortable. Unique design turns heads,GUA47
5,06/21/2016,Everything you dreamed of This shoe is absolutely insane!!!! this the best shoe!!!,GUA47
5,06/20/2016,"Good buy for the price Very comfortable.  The more you wear them, the better they got.  I wouldn't run in them, but they are great for style and comfort.  The traction wore out pretty fast on the bottom, but I was wearing them for 8-9 hours at a time on cement.  Can't beat $100/$50 for the great fit and bounce technology.",GUA47
4,06/20/2016, This has to be one of the best shoes that Adidas has ever created.,GUA47
5,06/19/2016,"Hottest new running shoe this year. They look great, but are still very affordable and comfortable.",GUA47

5,06/16/2016, The pattern was ugly. But the shoes are very confortable and the boost technology is great.,GUA47
5,06/16/2016,Worth the money The seamless design offers great comfort and allows the foot to move freely and the shoe looks also cheap I'm price,GUA47
5,06/16/2016,A great BANG for your Buck. The shoes 1st appearance is stunning and can surprisingly match the comfortability of the shoe as well.,GUA47

4,02/06/2017,"Very good value for a stylish trainer. Really nice pair of shoes. I went a half size larger and they fit perfect. If your being picky, you can see te glue used to between sole and main part of shoe. (When having a really close look).",BES59

5,11/28/2017,Awesome Shoes! Perfect shoes! I love it a lot! Wear it everyday in the gym. Really comfortable. I’m size 9 normally but in these shoes I got size 8.,BEV86
5,11/23/2017,"Most comfy shoe ever! I have Plantars Fasciitis in my left foot, and I have bought so many shoes from ASICS, New Balance, Hoka One One, Nike, Altra, etc., and I have had to either return them or take them to Goodwill because none of them helped my heel pain. I finally was shown some of these at a local shoe store and I was hooked! I am so thankful for that shoe salesman for showing me these. I now own four pair of these to rotate with. I love the look and most importantly the comfort of the boost midsole. I tried NMD’s and the Supernova’s as well, but the Ultra Boost is what has healed my heel pain! I have heard great things about the EQT Support 93/17’s, BUT they don’t make those for women. I do wish Adidas would make those for women so I could get a pair to try! Hint hint! I am thankful they make the Ultra Boost though and I give them a 10 out of 10! I don’t run but I walk a lot and can be on my feet all day and not feel any discomfort, so thank you Adidas!! Boost is life!",BEV86
4,11/10/2017,"Great purchase! It is a very comfortable soft shoe. Slightly bulky, and the laces have a small ""surface area"" on the top. The top is like a sock and the cage is supportive but not as much as I thought, the shoe was too wide for my foot, they run large. I went with the pure boost instead and I prefer it over the ultraboost! I would recommend both shoes!",BEV86
5,11/06/2017,"Love these shoes It's probably the best sneakers I've purchased so far. It's very soft and great for running or just walking in daily life. I like them so much and then my mom got those, too. If you're worried about the knitted part of the shoes is going to break, then you can chill because it's not going to happen unless you're doing something really intense.",BEV86
5,11/05/2017, I work in housekeeping and these shoes are excellent for me. My feet feel like I walking on clouds,BEV86
5,11/04/2017,"in love with these running shoes! Incredibly snug and lightweight! I love how I can just slip my feet into them. I have naturally flat feet, and the supportive cage really helps!",BEV86
5,10/29/2017,"love this shoe Great shoe. Comfort and style is spot on 
Shoe runs big. I ordered a full size smaller then usual.",BEV86
5,10/28/2017,chic and super comfy Love it! I size down from 7 to 6.5. It’s perercf and still plenty room in toe box. Would like to get it in color black as well.,BEV86
5,10/24/2017,"MY very first Adidas shoes! I have never owned a pairs of adidas in my life, and after having MANY MANY MANY years of feet pain, I have decided to invest in a pair of shoes that will do my feet pain some justice. I have walked a lot in many places like in amusement parks, traveling, school, walking even in my own neighborhood, and by the end of the day, the heal and the center of my feet sting like CRAZY. I do not have flat feet but a very small arch, which contributes to the pain. I would have to massage my feet in order to sleep properly, it's just that bad. Now, after some serious investigating and researching, I have concluded that the adidas ultraboost was the way to go. The reason why I researched these shoes so much is because I never have dropped so much cash in one pair on shoes in my life. I finally decided to order them two weeks ago, and ordered a 7.5 and 8 because a lot of people said to half size down and others said stay true to size. 7.5 reached my toes exactly and after trying on my 8, I noticed the center of my foot was being suffocated. It was perfect in size but too tight in the center. I ended up returning the 7.5 and kept the 8. I ordered an 8.5 (which by the way, took longer than expected to arrive....) and they finally arrived today! I put them on and immediately fell in love. The center of my foot was not suffocating and I felt super comfy in my bouncy shoes that curve to the shape of my foot. I ripped that tag off and officially called them mine. I can't wait for the comfort I am going to feel. I do not run but I do walk a lot. I will be using these these as a daily shoe. If you know you walk a lot or are just on your feet for a very long time, I recommend these shoes. I also remember reading that these shoes squeak a lot, the first two pairs I ordered did squeak a lot!! But the one that arrived today does not squeak, at least on tile. My last recommendation: If you KNOW you have wide feet, I recommend you 1/2 size UP! These are my very first pair of adidas shoes in my whole life. I am looking towards buying another pair soon, gotta be stylish and comfortable!",BEV86
5,10/24/2017,"One of my best purchase ever At first I was very thought about its price since I never spent for shoes that much.But I was fall in love with this shoes.(Actually,I also tried x all Terrain one,too.but it was very uncomfortable foe me)When I tried for my size I never want to take it off and want to jump so badly because I felt like If I jump,it will be send me very very high.haa!anyway,this is one of great shoe,so I recommend.",BEV86

5,10/22/2017,Extremely comfortable This is my second pair of Ultraboost. It's so comfortable I had to get another pair in a different color.,BEV86
4,10/22/2017,Wish they came in smaller sizes I love these shoes and I’m an insanely picky distance runner. I typically wear size 5 but these are too big and It’s very disappointing . I’m trying to just wear them anyway for the time being...but I would buy multiple pairs if they came in 4/ 4.5....,BEV86
5,10/21/2017,Best most comfortable shoe from adidas It's the most comfortable shoe I've had in years. And you can throw them in the washing machine and they come out clean and fresh.,BEV86
5,10/19/2017,The best ever will not wear anything but adidas The best ever I will not wear nothing but adidas very confterble,BEV86
5,10/17/2017,Will forever be an Addidas fan The padding in these shoes are phenomenal for long distance. It's like running on a trampoline cloud. The stretchy fabric for the shoe keeps me comfortable throughout my run and the soft padding around the ankle never brings discomfort . I've ran in two half marathons in these and they are still going strong. Worth every penny,BEV86
5,10/15/2017,Stylish and comfortable Quality of shoe is superb! So comfortable I could wear them all day long.,BEV86
5,10/15/2017,"Best shoes ever, if you don’t own a pair you definitely need to Seriously I’ve never had better shoes that the ultra boost. They’re so confortable, the price is totally worth it. The materials feel expensive and so soft. I truly recommend this shoes not only to runners but people who want confortable every day shoes.",BEV86
5,10/13/2017,"seriously, amazing Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. If you're thinking about buying them, do it.",BEV86
5,10/06/2017," I would recommend this to people, most comfortable shoe ever.",BEV86
5,09/30/2017," Great product, very comfortable. Came in a timely manner",BEV86
5,09/29/2017,"Comfiest running shoes, EVER! I work long hours on my feet and usually my feet are hurting my midday with other running shoes. The Ultra Boost shoes make it feel like your feet are resting on pillows. They are so comfortable! Love the energizing boost when I run with them. Love the breathability of the upper sole fabric. Love the snug ankle support. They may be pricey, but Adidas killed it with this sneaker! Would recommend the investment to anyone.",BEV86
5,09/29/2017,"Most comfy/stylish shoes. EVER. Believe it or not, I've ran 2 half marathons with these shoes plus many miles of training. I've used these shoes for traveling and even hitting the gym. Sadly, they're getting worn out now so I will be purchasing another pair. They're that great. My feet never hurt while wearing these. HIGHLY recommend.",BEV86
4,09/28/2017,Sliiiightly too big but nice. Gf liked it It’s a very comfy shoe. Kind of big but nice. Big by half a size,BEV86
5,09/28/2017,"This is a great shoe. Adidas ultra boost is a great shoe. It is really comfortable in the fact that it has boost but also because it supports our feet really well. I have a flat foot and with normal shoes, I got to wear a kind of plating so that it doesn't hurt my feet but with these shoes, without it I could still walk pretty well. I would recommend these but if you think that it's kind of pricey you should go with pure boost or nmd but it should be the R2 because it is way softer than R1. If you really want ultra-boost just wait until it's on sale. Overall this is the most comfortable shoe with great design I've ever worn in my life.",BEV86
5,09/25/2017,This is one of the best pairs of shoes ever I love them They are so comfortable and it’s like you’re wearing only socks,BEV86
5,09/18/2017, The only shoe my big toe doesn't bust out of :-)!!,BEV86
5,09/15/2017,"the hype is real and worth your money Although multiple reviews advised customers to order a half size up, I went with my normal sneaker size (5.5) for the core black and it fit me perfectly. Perhaps the sizing is off on other sizes, but I think if you're the same shoe size as me, ordering a 5.5 should be good enough. It matches what the sizing chart says of it being 22.5 cm, so if you're REALLY unsure, measure your foot!
It's super comfortable, very lightweight, and looks cute with just about any outfit. You won't regret buying it.",BEV86
5,09/15/2017,Daddy Order a half size down (I read the reviews before so knew this) otherwise THEY R PERFECT AND I LOVE THEM IM A SWAG MASTER,BEV86

5,06/15/2017,"best running shoes ever the most comfortable shoes ever. and i get complements on them all the time!! never regretted buying these, but (just like all adidas) i'd say definitely order at least 1/2 a size smaller than your usual shoe size",BEV86
5,06/15/2017,"Best tennis shoes ever! I love these shoes. They are the best tennis shoes I've ever owned . It feels like I am walking on pillows. After working out with them, I wear them all day because they are so comfortable.  I want buy another pair in a different color. I really hope they don't discontinued this show and continue to have it every year without changing one thing.",BEV86
3,06/15/2017,"Way too big/wide. Returned Way too large- returned! These shoes may be comfortable if you have wider feet. I always wear a size 9 and the9 was ludicrously big and the toe portion was so wide I felt that downsizing wouldn't help. The arch was in the wrong place for me- but if the sizing works for you, I can see how the soles would be cushiony and comfy. We all have narrow feet and Adidas brand are almost always good fits (thank goodness they've become fashionable again - now my kids don't gripe when I make them get adidas over other brands!). However- these shoes just didn't work for me.",BEV86
4,06/15/2017," Very  lightweight shoe, super comfortable. I originally ordered a size 8 but sized down to a 7.5 because it runs slightly large. I always get compliments every time I wear them!",BEV86
5,06/13/2017,"Favorite shoes-ever! Although supportive, these shoes are really like walking with marshmallows surrounding your feet. I've never had an athletic shoe have this combination. Highly recommended.",BEV86
3,06/10/2017,"could have done better the other styles simular to this fit your foot like a glove. this is different material and does not support your foot. To compensate, I tightened the laces, that lead to the rubber/plastic design digging into the sides of my feet and making the shoe uncomfortable. very disappointed, I love and only buy your foorwear.",BEV86
5,06/09/2017," I bought it for my daughter and she loved it! It was a little big, but still works.",BEV86
3,06/05/2017,"WAY too big!!!! I'm sure I would have loved this shoe, if the customer service associate would have told me to order the right size. 
I asked customer service if I should order a size down than what I usually do with running shoes, because on other websites (i.e. Footlocker) say to order a size down. They told me no, to order true to size. So I did, and it was WAY too big. Now I have to return them and they no longer have the size I need. 
Extremely disappointed, I was definitely looking forward to these shoes. 
Adidas should have a notice to order a half size down like other websites do.",BEV86
5,06/04/2017,"Extremely comfortable, great looking pair of shoes I'm a Men's Size 9.5-10, and I ordered the women's size 11. It's a tad long, but a great fit everywhere else.",BEV86

5,06/02/2017,"Comfortable, and run true to size. The UltraBoost do feel like marshmallows on your feet, as others have said! I should have stuck with my normal size 7 but went up a half a size as I did so in other adidas sneakers and these probably would have been better as a 7 for me, but still loving them!",BEV86
5,05/22/2017,New fav shoes so perfectly white and super comfortable when running because of the excess padding and squish of the sole.,BEV86

1,04/05/2017,"Low quality shoe that is not worth the insane price. At first when I bought my Boost Ultras I was as happy as could be. They are light, the have great arch support, and feel amazing when I went on runs. But after a short while I realized how poorly they are actually made.
 Within a week the paint of the ultra boost logo scratched away. This was nothing in my mind. But after two months the knitting on the sides of the shoes were quickly begining to tear and stretch out. I would like to point out that I am not an avid runner, so most of the use of these shoes was just from walking. 
Other issues I have had with the shoes include the cheap insoles on in the shoe. Whenever I actually did run on my Ulta boosts, they would bunch up almost instantly, causing discomfort. This happened so often that I opted to just take them out permanently. Out of all of these issues, these are the least of my concerns.
My biggest gripe about these shoes is the lackluster sole on the bottom of the shoe. It is so incredibly thin and wears away so easily. Within 4-5 months they were worn down to the boost foam in some areas. Again 90% of the use of these shoes was just walking and not even running​. Now, by the 9th month of having these shoes, the rubber sole is peeling apart and both of my shoes are torn practically all the way through the shoe near the front where the shoe should naturally bend when running. I really enjoyed these shoes when I first had them, but the are definitely not worth the hefty price for how short the last.",BEV86
5,03/31/2017,"Miracle trainers I have a arthritis in my right ancle and the boost sole is truly amazing for it, without a doubt the most comfortable trainers I've ever owned, really pleased",BEV86

2,03/18/2017,Lace up needs improvement. These were a full size too long and too wide. A huge problem as the shoe is sock like....hence when attempting to tighten you feel the lace and the hard plastic in addition to bunched material.,BEV86

4,03/10/2017,"Too Big I ordered my normal size and they were way to big and a little wide - as if they were men's shoes, not women's (they weren't). I had just bought a pair of adidas energy boost shoes in the same size and they fit perfectly. The footbed was VERY soft and comfortable but I think I will try to find locally to determine whether this style will fit my foot.",BEV86

I was worried about fit I'm usually a 9.5/10 in running shoes so I got a 10 and they're perfect. I rarely write reviews but these are 100% worth the rave they're receiving, I took them out for a run just a few hours ago and they're amazing. They also look really good on, not too bulky at all which I was worried about. Obessesed!!",BEV86

4,02/20/2017,"Amazingly comfy, but runs big. I ordered the all white Ultra Boosts online since I haven't been able to find them in store. I usually like to order shoes a half size larger for running shoes in case my feet swell since I wear them for work. I am a true size 7 with a B width. I tried them on and they feel so cushiony like you are waling on clouds, but sadly they are way too big.

5,12/15/2016,Best ultraboost to date These run a little large especially compared to the 2.0's. Some people say to go half a size down if you want a snug for but I say go true to size. The material on these is a lot loser and less right than previous versions. I'm a big fan of the translucent cage too. Best ultraboost so far,BEV86

2,08/22/2017,"Again amazing trainers but unfortunately I did not like the the glitter effect on them, unfortunate as I would liked them without glitter I really do like these trainers unfortunately I did not like the glitter effect on them, if this was not applied to the trainers I would have kept them, disappointing.",BEY09
5,08/01/2017," Good design, great price, afforable, cool , satisfying",BEY09
5,07/27/2017,Ultra boost what else is there to say?! It's a great trainer that gets more comfortable the more you wear. Just buy it already believe the hype.,BEY09

3,07/06/2017,"Close but no cigar in my honest opinion If these didn't have glitter all over 5/5, if you can get past that then buy them.",BEY09
5,06/25/2017, Ultra boost uncaged is a very comfortable shoe. This's my second ultra boost shoes.,BEY09
5,06/22/2017,Recommended if you're a boost finatic. Nice trainer but wear a little tight - need to go up half size otherwise its too tight the uncaged compared to normal ultra boost. Otherwise Great!,BEY09

1,06/16/2017,"Too narrow I do not like the uncaged versions, it feels to narrow",BEY09
4,06/16/2017,Boost and primenet is where it's at. The quality and look are great The only downside is I have really wide feet A lot wider than most people so the outer edge of my foot hangs out a little bit over the seem of the shoe I'm sure it would be better if I had the caged ones but overall I love them they're super comfortable,BEY09
5,06/16/2017,My 4th pair already and never disappoints! The Ultra Boosts are the most comfortable shoes ever.  I find it runs a bit tight so I usually order 1/2 size bigger.,BEY09

5,06/15/2017,Would buy again Very comfy and durable shoes they run a little big,BEY09
1,06/15/2017,It's cool to buy a pair of sneakers in your size and they're still sitting in the box 3 months later. way too small to wear. Still haven't worn.not 10.5,BEY09
5,06/15/2017,very comfortable The shoes are perfect but they are a bit hard to match with because they are definitely sparkly,BEY09

3,06/15/2017,"Wearing boost is new to me, it has taken time for the shoe to break in but still no comfortable to run in. Not worth $200 price tag, especially if it's so uncomfortable to run in!",BEY09

4,06/15/2017, The shoes are extremely comfortable and very cool looking. I have received several comments from complete strangers that have said the shoes are very cool! One complaint is that the on-line picture did not really show the silver threading running through the material as I thought they were a solid color. All in all a great show!,BEY09
1,06/15/2017,"Covered in sparkles They are very comfortable, but the picture online doesn't show the actual colors on the shoe. It's covered in sparkles, and doesn't match with anything. For the money I paid, I'm not happy.",BEY09
3,06/15/2017,"$216 paperweight Fit very snug width wise, length seemed okay. A lot to pay for a shoe that doesn't fit.",BEY09

3,06/15/2017, The UB product is great as always but the description of the shoe was a bit inaccurate. After receiving the shoe I noticed sparkles on the shoe which was not listed on the description.,BEY09
5,06/15/2017,"Marries form and function perfectly. This shoes provides outstanding cushioning, quick response and feels substantial despite the all-knit construction. The foot stays firmly in place with each stride. The only downfall is that the Continental sole should last longer, especially around the heel area. The sole tends to wear quicker than other shoes in this category. The price point of this shoe also demands longer wear. The shoe looks strikes a beautiful balance between form and function.",BEY09
4,06/06/2017,Great but sparkly Great but sparkly.  Black and grey is good but there's glitter sparkly stuff all over.,BEY09
1,06/04/2017,"Misleading photograph BEWARE OF GLITTER I am extremely disappointed. The shoes were caked in glitter, an absolute joke. The picture online doesn't accurately represent the product.

2,03/05/2017,"Glitter makes a great shoe unwearable The shoes themselves are comfortable, but the glitter makes them impossible to wear with regular clothes on a daily basis. It's even more sparkly outdoors with the sun. adidas really needs to update this product listing.",BEY09
4,03/05/2017, This is the super cozy one for you to go out to enjoy yourself,BEY09

3,03/03/2017,very comfortable but glittery i love the comfort of the shoes would not complain at all in that department but the shoe is a little narrow for my liking but the thing that would have driven me away from these if i could have seen them in store is the silver specs that seem a lot like glitter and not what i was really wanting was wanting i was looking for a less in your face shoe but that is not what this is,BEY09

4,02/28/2017,"Great shoe with one major flaw Everything about the uncaged is great upset one major design flaw with the heel cuff where the stitching meets, it scrapes the back of the foot so seems to be an overlooked feature, I will have to wear a sock with this uncaged shoe to make it bearable. Other then this the shoe is nice, fits alot more snug then the caged version of the shoe.",BEY09

5,02/25/2017,Like walking on clouds Shoes look so much better in person the orange and purple lace tips are a great detail. Comfort levels are of the scales,BEY09
5,02/24/2017,"By far the best running shoe on the market today. I have went through a lot of different running shoes in my lif. These are by far the best running shoe ever made. The comfort is unmatched by any other brand. Between my wife,daughter and myself we have purchased five pairs of the ultra boost and the uncaged. Do yourself a favor and try these shoes, you won't be disappointed.",BEY09
3,02/24/2017,"Sparkly, reflective ""glitter"" NOT SHOWN There are sparkly, reflective, almost glitter-like specs worked into the mesh of the shoe. I'm extremely disappointed in the website for hiding this. This detail is not shown in any of the photos or written about in the description. IMO it's very off-putting and makes the shoe ugly. I'm returning them. Wish they would have been portrayed accurately in the first place to save me the time and hastle. Don't be mislead.",BEY09
4,02/24/2017,"One of the top trainers on the market The product combines simplicity with elegance, whilst not neglecting comfort",BEY09

5,02/24/2017,"Good colourway for UNcaged Good fit, original design, and very comfortable to wear.",BEY09
4,02/24/2017,"Great shoes, great fit, not sure about the silver speckles in the Knit. A brilliantly designed shoe and fits pretty much true to size. The only problem with this particular colourway (silver with silver Boost) was the silver speckles in the PrimeKnit. It doesn't show it in the product photos but I found it a little blingy when I tried them on.",BEY09
5,02/24/2017,Fantastic Great design combined with superior quality and perfect fit.,BEY09
1,02/23/2017,"Comfortable but super girly in this colorway. Honestly one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had. The problem is the shoes are beyond girly. They are sparkly and the tips on the laces will get you made fun of. I have never been more angry after opening a shoe box in my entire life. The shoes are amazing, but I couldn't get over the sparkles.",BEY09
1,02/23/2017,"Don't buy if you don't like glitter on you shoes. GLITTER ALL OVER! These shoes are full of glitter in the stitching, which is not shown in the pictures nor in the description. These are definently girls shoes. Picture below taken with iPad 2 (hence, not hard to capture this horrible glitter).",BEY09
5,02/23/2017, My first Uncaged UB and most comfortable sneaker over the caged. Love the design as always.,BEY09
4,02/23/2017,"These actually have glitter on them. I dont think the picture does justice. but of course, great pair!! #BoostLife These actually have glitter on them. I dont think the picture does justice. but of course, great pair!! #BoostLife",BEY09
1,02/23/2017,"No way Review doesn't tell you that these shoes are ""sparkly""",BEY09
5,02/22/2017, I like them because they are comfortable and they look good,BEY09
1,02/22/2017, Beware! These shoes have GLITTER all over them that you can't see in the pictures. They look like girls shoes. The shoelaces also have orange and purple tips which make the shoes look more like girls shoes. They also look a lot lighter than the picture.,BEY09
2,02/21/2017,"Great shoe design, poor quality I love the ultra boost line and the uncaged variant. I really like this colourway too. However, the pair of shoes that I received shouldn't (in my opinion) have made it through quality control. The boost midsole was a huge selling point, it's the first time it's been silver and one of the few times it has been coloured. On both of my shoes, the boost is damaged. It's cosmetic and doesn't really impact performance, but at £140 and an adidas product, I'm really disappointed. It looks as though the shoes have been worn before being shipped. The heel area is creased and there are holes present throughout the shoes. I feel as if the quality of boost has gone downhill as of late. I own 4 pairs of NMDs and 2 other pairs of Ultra Boosts. The shoes purchased prior to December 2016 had no issues at all and were perfect. But the shoes purchased from mid December onwards have been really sub par. This is the 3rd pair of boost shoes I've bought within that time frame that have had issues with quality control on the boost sole. 

I don't know if it's just my luck or what, but its really quite upsetting. I'm passionate about sneakers and love what adidas have been doing lately but this issue needs to be resolved. If you can get a pair without any issues, then I'd go for them. But I'm not sure if I'll be buying anymore for awhile.",BEY09
5,02/16/2017,"Treat Yourself Bought these because they're the closest to Yeezys I could find, happened to luck into these since I hear they're limited. Super comfy, love the two tone tips. Pricey, but I mean you gotta treat yourself.",BEY09
5,02/16/2017,"Unbeatable Ultraboost Amazing shoe! Really comfortable and great quality, definitely worth the price",BEY09
5,02/16/2017,Best pair of shoes I've ever had The comfort and style are worth splashing out for these shoes,BEY09
5,02/14/2017, I love this shoe. It is super comfy and stylish. Would recommend!,BEY09
5,12/05/2017,Awesome shoes Super comfortable running shoes. Just bought another pair,BEY10
5,12/05/2017,"Definitely worth the money These shoes are great, perfect fit and super comfy. Also managed to improve my 5k pb by 30 seconds which is crazy, shows how important good kit is!",BEY10
3,12/02/2017,Not as good as previous model I have worn Supernovas for 3-4 years. Previous versions have fit very well. This latest model did not fit as well as the previous models. The heel cup is more shallow and they are tighter across the ball of the foot. I will stay with adidas but will look for a different model that fits better.,BEY10
5,12/02/2017,Put them on and it felt like walking on air. There wasn't a need to break them in. Once on they cushion joints and give an extra hop in step.,BEY10
4,11/06/2017,Husband loves these Bought for husband and he says they are so comfortable and he would recommend them.,BEY10
5,11/06/2017,I'm an older runner--perfect support and comfort. I've tried many shoes and have run on and off since I was in little athletics 50 years ago. I ran a half marathon 10 years ago in under 2 hours in supernovas and injured myself when I changed to another brand. I'm on the comeback trail again and these are perfect.,BEY10
4,10/22/2017,"Good quality but Adidas should stick to the Glide 8 Compared to the Adidas Supernova Glide 8 these STs are not the same, the quality of the Supernova Glide 8 is far superior. My heel keeps slipping out of the shoe so working out in them is not possible (i use them for walking). Adidas needs to stick to what works and get back to quality.",BEY10

5,10/13/2017,"quality and comfort at a reasonable price I'm finding that too often sneakers that reviewers describe as ""OMG MOST COMFORTABLE EVER"" are more like slippers that would be good for lounging around in.

These sneakers are great for standing, walking etc: the offer support, cushioning, breath-ability, and style. I'm happy with this purchase - I got them on sale for around $55",BEY10
4,10/07/2017,"Great quality all-around shoe The foam in this should is soft when it needs and firm at the same time.  Standing around?  Soft.  Running, jumping?  Firm enough to never bottom out.  I do short runs (a mile or so) and play volleyball in them, as well as just general playing around, chasing the kids about.  They work great for everything.  They were slightly too snug/narrow at first, but with a little use are about perfect.",BEY10
5,10/04/2017,One of the best supportive shoes in the market out there Brilliant for long and supported run . The good flexibility and the lightness well adapt this shoes also for shorter distance. Top end choice.,BEY10

3,09/27/2017,"Shallow heel I bought these because I thought they would be a cheaper alternative to the Ultraboost ST. They just don’t compare. The heel is too shallow and you have to lock them down. Even then, they just don’t mold to my foot like adidas usually do. 

They aren’t bad shoes if they suit you, but they are not in the same class as the ultraboost ST. Spend the extra, especially since the adidas website gives you 15% off.",BEY10
2,09/24/2017," Weird heel design. Too short, too wide at heel. My foot slipped out.",BEY10
5,09/10/2017,Excellent like I expected I ordered these because I always wear Adidas because of quality comfort and fit. I was not disappointed once again. I was able to start walking and jogging right away. No break in period necessary,BEY10

4,07/29/2017, It's Adidas that's what matters and the name supernova grabs my attention to buy it...,BEY10
5,07/25/2017,Excelent product Excelente quality and high level conform to running,BEY10
4,07/20/2017,"Surpasses the old Supernova Sequence Stability shoe For those used to running in Adidas Supernova Sequence stability shoes, the ST offers greater absorption of impact and much better cushioning with the use of the Boost technology.

The toe box feels slightly wider but the internally the shoe is a more comfortable fit as a whole compared with previous Supernova Sequence.

A slightly lighter shoe and sleek design with the boost technology is a great step in the right direction for Adidas and the stability line. 

I did buy the black colour online and would say these actually appear more on the dark grey side than the black it shows on the website.",BEY10
5,07/16/2017,"Greatest running shoe ever! Absolutely amazing shoe! Comfort, light, it's like running on air! Would highly recommend!",BEY10
4,07/13/2017,Fantastic if you can get them to fit. Can't fault the quality but once again adidas fitting problems. Have 9.5 in all other running shoed and these are too tight yet the 10 is too big.,BEY10
5,07/07/2017,"Glad I purchased it Great shoe, nice and light and you can feel the spring when running.",BEY10
3,07/05/2017,"Comfortable, good looking trainer but not recommended for longer distances Found that the product ran a little wider / larger than supernova sequence 9s I owned.

Slight issue with the design around the ankle - feels a bit lacking in support compared to other adidas trainers (i.e. sequence boosts and boost STs) which led to slight slippage around ankle area over longer runs. Overall, very comfortable for walking around and gym use but have not my preferred choice for running outdoors over any 10km+ distance.",BEY10
5,06/30/2017,GOOD purhace It was really nice It was really comfrtable. THE boost IS really good,BEY10
5,06/26/2017," nice stability shoe, works for me, plus like the colors",BEY10
4,06/24/2017,"Good all rounder for overpronators, doesn't feel all that boosted. The ride is stable and comfortable, although the boost is less noticeable a feature than it looks like it would be. The shows are also quite heavy in hands and on feet. Toe box is very roomy, which depends on preference sould be a good or bad thing.",BEY10
5,06/10/2017,"Boos is Live energy I really like the Boost. It design, look, outfit are really amazing. The boost technology is really a new innovation by Adidas. This has provided relief to my paining feet and now I am stress free and painless.",BEY10
5,05/22/2017,Great sneaker The sneaker is great... it's so comfortable. And it looks incredible . I will order another pair in a different color way real soon,BEY10
3,12/03/2017,"Great support, but toebox is way too narrow. They feel comfortable initially. Stable and light. But the toe box is too narrow and I didn’t start to notice until after mile 5 of a long run.",BEY99
5,12/02/2017, Fits great and does the job. The review said my text was too short so I am adding to it.,BEY99
5,12/01/2017,Quality product but very tight. I would recommend this product but going a half size up is a must. Unfortunately I didn't get to full test this product because it was so tight and almost painful to run.,BEY99
5,11/23/2017,"Amazing running shoe These shoes are so good, I barely even notice them when running! They are very lightweight and very comfortable and, after being properly laced, give lots of support to my ankles too. Highly recommend!",BEY99
5,11/21/2017,2ND PAIR DIFFERENT COLOR AMAZINGLY LIGHT WITHOUT COMPROMISING STABILITY AND CUSHION!,BEY99
2,11/18/2017,"Not the same I started running on a pair of tempo 8 (v1 green) and I loved literally everything about them (about 600 miles at this point). This new version went on sale and I jumped on it, to extreme disappointment. Out of the box the laces come going out to in, unlike literally every other shoe requiring you to take them out and re-lace them. The tongue is no longer gusseted, therefor slides and bunches. The quality feels HEAVILY reduced, feeling cheap on your foot. The toe box is much smaller, they reduced the stable frame from under the ball of your foot to just under your toes and replaced it with a energized stability boost, which I feel like once broken in won't give nearly as much pronation support as the stable frame. To try and compensate the pushing forward of the stable frame they tried to compensate by adding more torsional control on the inner heel alike the supernova, but it just makes the shoes ridiculously rigid out of the box. I'm disappointed because the tempo 8's are the most comfortable feeling shoes to run in both long and short distances, and this seems like a serious step down :/",BEY99
5,11/18/2017," Great quality, boost cushioning is awesome. Higly recommended.",BEY99
4,11/18/2017,"light makes fast I've had at least 3 tempos before (the 5 and two pairs of the 6), all of which were before the Boost technology. I still love the shoe, but the sizing is so frustrating - I was 9.5 in the other pairs, but the sizing for this model seems to have changed. It's silly that there is so little consistency. BUT, if you can get the size right I'm confident this would be an even better shoe than its predecessors. ""Light makes fast"" as the insoles used to say. I use mine for pretty much all running, not just threshold/tempo runs. If you're not too heavy (I'm 10 stone 2 pounds) and need no or only mild stability features, why wouldn't you?",BEY99
3,11/14/2017,"Not the best purchase ever Love the boost technology and the colors of the show, comfortability not so much. A little too tight",BEY99
5,11/09/2017, perfect step between the supernova and boston/adios.,BEY99
5,11/09/2017,"Great shoe for speed, track and medium distance running This shoe is perfect for someone who needs a little bit of stability but not a huge amount. I used to wear Supernova's and Adios' but they had no stability features and so I needed to move to more supportive shoes. The Tempo's still feel light enough to race in but sturdy enough to get you through a marathon.",BEY99
1,11/08/2017,"I WOULD LIKE TO EXCHANGE AND RETURN THIS ITEM IT IS GREAT PRODUCT AND MATERIAL BUT I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS SHOES AS IT IS, TOO SMALL",BEY99
5,10/27/2017,Best training shoe ever Super comfortable for the longer runs yet fast enough for speed work-outs. Great to train in these and race in the Adios.,BEY99
3,10/18/2017,"Cool but too small compred to my terrex shoes I liked them but the process to get them was kind of hard cause the size I always wear with the previous adidas shoes I bought (I love adidas stuff) was 9 1/2 and this ones were too tight so I returned them and bought a half size bigger, and it results also this ones feel tight and also I can see my finger through the shoe, I am going to keep them and see how they work in a 10 km run.",BEY99
5,10/14/2017,"So far so good, just switched from Boston 6 Keep your feet very secure great shoes for training",BEY99
4,10/09/2017,"great, quick training shoes. They are light and feel comfortable which then make you feel like you are running fast. Great training shoes.",BEY99
3,10/03/2017, It's a good shoe. I like look and the cushion but it's just a little too small.,BEY99
2,09/29/2017,The colour looks pinkish in reality so had to return. It doesn't looo like red as shown in pictures. Quality wise no issues but colour was not as expected,BEY99
4,09/27/2017,"Great but way too narrow midfoot These are just a little bit shorter than Adizero Adios 2 (the old non-Boost ones). I've always used the same size for Adidas but I think I need to go 1/2 size up with all the current Adizero models.

These have the same issue as I had with Supernova: The midfoot part is way too narrow. (I have regular width forefoot.) The high edge of the midsole hits my arch. I think at least the Supernova line has gone narrower from midfoot after Glide 7...

I returned these. However, the shoes appeared to be very good so if your midfoot is narrow these can work for you. The heel is almost completely neutral. The front has the most of the stability features. The cushioning felt excellent: not too soft but not hard at all, just right.",BEY99
5,09/02/2017,"Perfect balance between light and stability If you like the Adios Adizero 3 and looking for something similar with more support, these shoes are for you. Just like the Adios, they will take time to stretch and get comfortable. Put in at least 20 miles before judging these shoes. They offer support without the annoying heel slippage that comes with the big bulky stability shoes.",BEY99
3,08/29/2017,"Great shoes, slightly in the narrow side These are great shoes in terms of quality &looks. However, slightly narrow on the toes and it seems the left and right fit not exactly the same. 
Still I like wearing them.",BEY99
4,08/21/2017,"great runners shoe perfect fit and good absorption while running
shoe fits pretty well and is recommended for frequent runners with distance below 20km",BEY99
5,08/06/2017,Wonderful fitting shoe! The shoe fits very nicely on the feet and wraps around so smooth and light..perfect for tempo runs,BEY99
4,07/23/2017,"Good shoe for fast paced daily training It's a great shoe for fast paced dailey training. I kept the same size as my other adidas shoes. The fit of this shoe is different from the other shoes. It has a snug forefoot, but not uncomfortable. It has also a pointy toe-box. Which means that the Tempo 9 has an overall snug fit including a relatively shallow toe-box.  A faster shoe is tighter like a race-shoe. As for the fit, the Tempo 9 has a bit of a racing shoe. For me, no problem.  However, people with a wider forefoot should keep this in mind and better choose a size larger. The Tempo 9 has a firm ride. Soft the shoe may not be, but responsive it certainly is. The Tempo 9 is a lightweight and supportive trainer. The tempo 9 is a neutral runningshoe. But I have a slight overpronation. However, the shoe supports sufficient and has no problems in this area. The upper is airy en there's enough ventilation. I can't say much about the durability of the shoe. But my experience with my other adidas says this is good. The Continental outsoles are very durable. So I'm verry happy with these shoes.",BEY99
5,07/20/2017,Wondedrful. This is my third comment on these shoes. They are absolutely wonderful. I am going to order another pair.,BEY99
5,07/17/2017,"A great companion to the Adios 3 I've been wearing the previous version of the Tempo, the Tempo 8, as my daily trainer for everything from steady long runs to fast interval sessions. The Tempo 8 were very good shoes, but the Tempo 9 are better. I race in the Adios 3, and the Tempo 9 are a beefed up version of the Adios 3 in many respects. The upper of the Tempo 9 is the biggest improvement over the Tempo 8. Gone is the sleeve, in favour of a more traditional tongue with a lace loop. The tongue is more comfortable than the previous versions sleeve. I always found the sleeve a slight bit too short on the Tempo 8, but the tongue on the Tempo 9 solves that. The sole unit is changed, and now uses dual density Boost in the midfoot on the inside. In reality this feels quite similar to the previous version, offering just a touch of stability. The torsion system in the new version is very similar to the Adios 3, and extends to the inner heel, which it didn't do on the Tempo 8. If anything this makes the Tempo 9 feel more responsive, but not noticeably more so than the 8. The Continental rubber outsole, a brilliant compound offering great grip on tar, grass or even compact trail, has been beefed up a little and should last longer. If you liked the Tempo 8, you'll get on great with the Tempo 9. If you race in the Adios 3, you could easily use the Tempo 9 as your daily trainer. The fit of the upper feels a little more ""racing flat"" than the Tempo 8. Fits my foot perfectly, but those with wider feet will need to try them on before buying. Overall the build quality is a step up on the newer version, but the feel is very similar to the 8 if a little snappier. Drop remains at 10mm so nothing to worry about there.",BEY99
3,07/16/2017," My first disappointing sneakers from Adidas. First of all, these shoes are much more green in person than the pictures show. So if you were hoping for a turquoise blue, like in the pics, you will not be getting those. There were also several QC issues. Loose stitching in a couple spots. Large chunks of what appeared to be excess thread stuck between seams, affecting the aesthetic. As for the Boost soles, they do appear substantial, but while moderately comfortable to walk in, the cushioning was nowhere near my Iniki Runners. I was pleasantly surprised by how breathable the shoes were. Very airy. But misleading color, QC issues, and insufficient Boost, make this an average shoe at best. Glad I didn't pay full price!",BEY99
5,07/15/2017,"Favorite Adidas shoe in a long time. Great fit. Light enough to run fast in, comfortable enough for daily use. This is the 3rd pair I've purchased. Planning to run in these for a while.",BEY99

Such a light shoe, such a good response, such a new funky style. I feel they are good for distance, speed/tempo maybe even racing. I am use to Boston Boost but happy I went to the Pure Boost, Toe box is wide, the shoe is great for when my feet expand and light for hot long summer runs.",IJD75
1,07/24/2017,"Do not buy, very uncomfortable. I usually wear another brand of running shoes. Wanted to see how adidas stacked up against the competition.

5,02/12/2017,Great shoe Very comfortable & amazing design. Would've liked continental rubber.,IJD75
4,02/11/2017,Not bad Very comfortable shoe a tad bit wide on my foot and when I bought I went a half size up,IJD75
5,02/11/2017,Super comfortable Shoe fits great & feels good when jogging with them.,IJD75

5,02/11/2017,Nice looking It's very nice looking if you want a pair of white shoes.,IJD75
5,02/10/2017,"Best price value, so much comfort and you save at least 50 USD by picking these up over ultra boosts. This is the first pure boost model I've ever purchased, and was blown away by how comfortable the shoe is. It's by far my most eye popping shoe, and most exceedingly comfy.",IJD75
3,02/10/2017,"Just Okay This shoe overall is extremely comfortable but one problem i have with it is the price. $130 or $140 for black and white (oreo) seems a bit excessive. especially when this shoe dose not feature prime knit, continental, and torsion overall the cheap mesh upper they put on the shoe is itchy and overall not very comfortable and form fitting",IJD75
5,02/03/2017,"Lost for words First boost shoe I've gotten, I was lost for words. They're a very clean shoe, to wear with jeans or joggers. Very high quality would highly recommend. True to size from my experience.",IJD75
5,12/02/2017,"Super Comfy Shoe Great shoe, def would recommend!  Shoe is very comfortable.  Wore it on Black Friday for work and held up like a champ!",IJD73
4,11/30/2017,Great shoes The shoes are great and they fit well. My only complaint is that the shoes squeak quite a bit which is annoying. Maybe I got a defective product.,IJD73
5,11/17/2017,"Comfy and good looking casual shoes I bought these from the Chicago Adidas outlet. They are comfortable and great to wear with denim as they have a casual style. Would highly recommend for walking, light running and training.",IJD73
3,11/12/2017," Comfortable and really light , not sure like the tongue as it hard to set in place as you tie shie.",IJD73
5,10/26/2017,"Literal Every Day Shoes This pair of shoes is literally the best pair I have ever worn. I wear them to work, wear them to run, I wear them for everything. The boost sole alone helped with my lower back problems so much it's crazy (I work retail so I'm literally on my feet all day) So if you're on the fence about buying these let me say I was too, but they were BEYOND worth while. Seriously don't let the price scare you. They will last and they will do you wonders!",IJD73
5,10/24/2017,"Amazing Purchase These shoes feel great on-feet, even though they're not as comfortable as some other boost shoes. Would recommend to anyone anyways, still super comfortable for the price",IJD73
4,10/19/2017,"Mostly good Worn these a few times now. 5 stars for looks, 3 stars for comfort, net 4 stars total.  The shoes look awesome and are lightweight. Like others have noted, the lack of liner is perplexing. It's not the softest underfoot and my big toe sits right on the stitching (which sorta stabs at certain angles). Also, I get the tongue design but it seems like overkill.  I'd go 5 stars if there was a soft liner.",IJD73
5,10/18/2017,"My best Adidas Purchase Yet I love these shoes so much. They are so comfortable and have lots of impact protection for running. Good alternative to ultra boost, I think the ultra boosts are just a little more comfortable then these (Save your $50). I would recommend to anyone who wants shoes that are comfortable for casual and performance wear.",IJD73
4,10/15/2017,Very Nice Very comfortable and stylish. Great to wear all day. A little loose and the tongue is weird but I would recommend to others,IJD73
5,10/01/2017,I love the product I love this shoe it is perfect and loads of my piers love it. I got it for $70 at an adidas outlet . They had a 50%sale on most of their shoes and this one stood out.,IJD73
1,09/23/2017,Stupid TongueDesign I wanted to like these but the stupid folding tongue system makes them terribly uncomfortable. Everything else about the shoe is great but I eventually got my scissors out and removed about 2/3 of the tongue material. Wish I'd just returned them instead.,IJD73
5,09/15/2017,"Great design and comfortable, perfict fit for all day active wear! Breathable Great design and construction perfict fit for Gym Workout or Running. I recommend it to all who want a comfortable & active sneaker to do it all!",IJD73
2,09/06/2017,"Worst PureBoost Shoe yet These shoes are simply not comfortable. I love the Pureboost brand, and they have revolutionized how comfy I think shoes can be. But these shoes feel cheap and are just no longer comfortable. I thought I had just gotten used to how PureBoost shoes felt, but I went back and tried on the previous 2 versions I own and it is a world of difference. These shoes dropped the ball and I'm nervous to continue buying them.",IJD73
5,09/05/2017,"Perfect shoes The most comfortable shoe ever , it looks good and feels good",IJD73
1,09/04/2017,"Poor arch and lack of liner diminishes cushion in toe box. Run 130 - 150 miles month, looking for a new shoe and have had luck with other models, no liner should have tipped me off.  Shoe doesn't respond and lacks cushion thorough arch toe area.  Stylish for running errands.",IJD73
3,08/31/2017,"Good Shoe but... I wear Adidas running shoes exclusively and decided to try these Pure Boost. I did not like the multi-layered tongue right off the bat but the shoe is well built with loads of Boost. I did return the shoes since they were the largest fitting Adidas shoe I've bought. Wearing a size 12 with the typical thumbnail width of space for movement, these shoes had a full two thumbs of space in the toe box and fit me super loose.",IJD73
5,08/28/2017,This shoe is very comfortable and is a nice shoe to wear casually. The shoe is a great shoe to wear casually and I have used this shoe to go biking and doing running down at the beaches and this shoe is very comfortable to wear. It feels like you are walking on a pillow.,IJD73
5,08/27/2017,people sleeping on these...thank you for sleeping! Under rated boosts. I found my unicorns. Thank you adidas for making ultra boost in my size.,IJD73

5,08/12/2017,"Awesome running shoes Bought them primarily for running, but just wearing them around they're extremely comfortable. Having gone through a lot of running shoes in the last few years including a couple pairs of adidas, these are the best so far.",IJD73
5,08/08/2017,"Best shoe ever made Most comfortable, most stylish  shoes, boost technology is the best.",IJD73
5,08/04/2017,Primary shoe on Eurotrip Took these shoes on a two week adventure in Europe. On average walked about 7miles a day and topped out at 14miles for a day. These shoes were great and allowed me to walk continually for a long time. They also stayed pretty cool despite the hot weather. Highly recommend them for solid walking shoes. Also fancy restaurants with basic dresscode didn't give me a hard time for having these on. One more - easy to clean!!!!,IJD73
4,07/26/2017,Good Shoe Needs better insole ALL Ultra Boost; A-1 very good running shoe........,IJD73
5,07/21/2017, One of the most comfortable running/ casual shoes on the market. I got the 1st gen 3 years ago and so far it's still the best. This 3rd gen is slighly not compatible to the 1st one but still outweigh all other brands in term of style and comfort.,IJD73
1,07/14/2017,"Ugly .. cheaply made and not compfortable Way to much foam on the bottom, looks like your wearing snow shoes and felt very cheap. But Adidas has awesome customer care and return policy so they returned them with no problem.",IJD73
5,07/13/2017,Love the shoe and the look love the shoes. only wish is that I would have ordered a half size smaller.,IJD73
1,07/08/2017,"Worst purchase from adidas. Unexpected from a great company, of usually such high-quality, like this. After only a week out of the box, both shoes tore without any physical disturbance. To ensure that it wasn't anything I had done, both shoes tore in the same exact area. I have no idea why this happened, but i do know that the shoes could be defective. I have already contacted customer service through two emails and never recieved a reply, and I would definitely appreciate a reply to this review to try and get this fixed.",IJD73

5,06/21/2017,its amazing if you dont wanna waste ur money It was really comfortable to walk around the city. I liked to walk for 5 hours with these shoes without break and my feet were barely hurting and I didn't have any overheating in my feet. This is basically a cheaper ultraboost.. but ultraboosts comfortability is uncomparable just saying,IJD73
2,06/19/2017,tongue not good idea do not like the tongue. there is no reason to have the tongue folded over 3 times.,IJD73
3,06/18/2017, Like the shoes but doesn't come with insoles nor does adidas sell them.,IJD73

5,06/15/2017,"The style and comfort are perfect! It's the perfect shoe I've worn it during the day and at night. Everyone thinks they're Yeezys and I don't mind because I've wanted a pair forever. With these you get the look without the hassle, and price tag.",IJD73

4,06/15/2017," Great style, medium comfort. Ultra Boost still the best.",IJD73
4,06/15/2017,"My favorite shoes By far my favorite shoes. I occasionally run in them, but primarily use them for leisure wear. Very comfortable and stylish. My only complaint is that the white midsole gets dirty and scuffed quite easily. So far it cleans up decently, but I can tell the bright white is not going to last. If you wear these sparingly and not on outdoor trails (dirt, gravel, etc.) it should be fine, but it will inevitably become scuffed. If they came in in the black and white upper with solid black midsole out outsold, I would highly recommend those. Overall, excellent shoe for working out, running, and leisure wear.",IJD73
5,06/15/2017,Best pair of shoes I’ve had. Most comfortable shoe I’ve ever had and very stylish and durable.,IJD73

4,06/15/2017," The shoe is wide which makes it comfortable, but also weird to look at depending on the angle you look at the shoe.",IJD73
5,06/13/2017,Amazing The heel lockdown needs som help but easily the second best shoe I have ever owned. ( And the best is are the Ace 16+ purecontrol which are 300$ and laceless),IJD73
5,06/05/2017,"A product that can be used in multiple situations. Whether in the gym or outside running on a trail, the shoe produces comfort all around. It is perfect for the gym or for running purposes.",IJD73
4,06/05/2017,"2nd Place Ain't So Bad Some things you may want to know about me before you read this. I have worn Ultraboosts (caged/uncaged), PK NMDs and Pureboosts before. While I have had several opportunities to cop, but I always cheaped out or returned them because I couldn't justify spending 150+ on shoes I intend to wear. That being said, in December I finally pulled the trigger on these shoes, and I was  pleasantly surprised yet slightly disappointed.

First, the positives. The upper is super breathable with a pretty cool pattern. I have wide feet (to the point where classic stan smiths are uncomfortable to wear) and these are perfect. I took these with me to NYC and they held up great. The breathable upper kept my feet cool in the humid weather, and the boost held up well under my 185 lbs of raw fat. And despite not being Continental, the sole is still holding up on my pair.

Here are the negatives. I feel that for the quality of the upper we should be charged a price closer to 120USD. The weave is tough, but doesn't feel/look the best (in my opinion). Also, I purchased the Core Black, Core Black, Running White version. I personally like the pattern, but I had to get used to people mistaking them for Feezys. The boost is also more stiff than the Ultraboost's which I've found to still be very comfortable (just not as comfortable). The tongue can also be off putting to people. I personally don't mind the burrito style but many people I have spoken to have been turned off by them. And lastly, the adidas website pictures fail to present how pronounced the three stripes are on the shoe. The three stripes look like a subtle grey in the website photo, but it is a very pronounced black in the final product. Some people may like that about the shoe, but I personally hoped for a more subtle look.

Where does this shoe sits in the current market? Besides knit NMDs, it's hard to find a pair of streetwear shoes with boost for this cheap. The uppers of both the Ultraboosts (caged/uncaged) and PK NMDs are far superior in softness/stretch, but not breathability. Despite this, I would still rank them in the following order of comfort.

1. Ultraboost (caged)
2. Pureboost
3. Ultraboost (uncaged)
4. PK NMD

The reason why Pureboosts beat out uncaged Ultraboosts and PK NMDs are the following. I have found that the collars of both Ultraboost (uncaged) and NMD to be very constricting around my ankle (I would say I have regular sized ankles). I also preferred the slightly wider cushion of boost. While the Ultraboost (uncaged) had a superior sole/midsole, I could not get over the ankle collar's vice-like grip. Maybe it's something you need to stretch out with time? I'm not sure.

While there are several negatives to the Pureboosts, the shoe is still great, and the current best gateway to comfortable boost. If you're on a limited budget and don't care what others think I couldn't recommend them more. But if you're looking for the best in comfort and style, save your money for a pair of Ultraboosts (caged). That's what I plan to be my next cop.",IJD73
5,06/03/2017, It's very comfortable for me to wear it every day.,IJD73
1,05/30/2017,"worst purchase ever my pure boost shoes were good for a month and now after 2 months of use they are not comfortable at all, they wear off too quick . it was my worst investment ever. i chose them because i thought they would be comfortable but after a month they were not comfortable at all and now i really dont use them.",IJD73
5,05/25/2017,"Very comfy, great alternative to the Ultraboost These are a great alternative to the Ultraboost if you could not get the UB in your fav colorway or if you just wanna save that much extra cash. In my opinion, these are not that much behind the UB in terms of comfort. You definitely feel that the Boost is thinner than the UB under your feet, but this also allows for better ground feel if you plan to run with these. The circle knit upper is very comfy too. It's not stretchy, so it provides more support and security. Heel lockdown is way better than the UB 3.0 (you're out of luck if you wanna wear these as slip-ons). Style-wise, man, these are dope. The silhouette is not as classic as the UB, but these may even look ever so slightly cleaner that UBs.

These have held the title for the most comfortable pair of shoes I own for quite some time before I got my UBs. Take my word for it: throw a pair of Ortholite insoles in these, and you get about three quarters of the comfort level of UBs. No joke. These are a great deal.",IJD73
4,05/19/2017,"Beautiful, but really bad pitfalls. The shoe is beautiful. However, the product team seems to have missed some very obvious and glaring issues. #1) What is up with the tongue? There is no reason it needed to be designed like that. As John Oliver would say... ""...cool."" It occasionally clumps strangely leading to blisters on the top of my foot. #2) The material around the ankle chafes me severely on every run. Friend has same shoes, same issue. I don't want to have to wear thick shin high wool ankle shoes to go for a run. #3) The sole is incredibly hard near the tip of the shoe. This makes running on toes painful. 

The shoe is beautiful though. So I'll give it that.",IJD73
5,05/19/2017,More colors to choose This product is perfect for me. This one is your smart choose,IJD73
5,05/14/2017,"Almost as perfect as the originals This is my fifth pair of pure boosts and first of the new ones.  The are extremely light, cushioned without being too much, and incredibly responsive. My only issues is I preferred the original flat bottoms, not these new bumps, and the tongue and laces were better on the original in my opinion. I would still highly recommend this shoe to anyone.",IJD73
5,05/13/2017,"Great overall Very comfortabel, lightweight, but to small. Perfect for everyday use.",IJD73
5,05/13/2017,"Great pair of shoes that look great too. These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. I live in a big city, and walk to most things I do. After walking a few days in a pair of Sperrys, I knew I needed to make a change. I was trying to find a pair of shoes that were comfortable enough to walk a few miles in, but still looked fashionable. These absolutely fit the bill. They make me feel as if I walking on clouds, and make me look good while wearing them. The design of the tongue of the shoe is completely innovative and allows for a truly custom fit, making the shoe feel perfect on my foot every time. I would recommend these to anyone who is in the market for a new pair of shoes.",IJD73
5,05/11/2017,"Great purchase. It's very flexible and easy to wear, but it has really good support.",IJD73
5,05/10/2017,Pure Boost very comfortable. The pure boost have to be a budget friendly option other than the NMD line those who are interested in taking the plunge with the Adidas Boost,IJD73
3,05/09/2017,"Gotta return it. The Pureboost looks really nice online/advertisement. But the actual shoes look really bulky at the bottom. When i try it on, it's not comfortable like the Ultraboost. So if u can afford it, i recommend the Ultraboost. Another thing is that i dont know if my pair of shoes coming with missing insole inside the shoes. Or it's just the design like that. But it's not really comfortable. The size shoes is perfect for me, i have to agree with that. But it doesnt offer the support like other product of Adidas.",IJD73
5,05/06/2017,Walking on cloud Most comfortable shoe ever feels amazing when walking,IJD73
5,04/28/2017,"Most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. This shoe may be pricy, but I feel it is worth every penny. More available than Ultra Boosts and can be worn casually or even as a runner.",IJD73
5,04/26/2017,"Boost for comfort, curves for style So comfortable and stylish I bought 2 pairs: black and blue/gum soles. I could never catch the triple black so I am thinking of just customizing the midsole withblack dye, just like in youtube diy's. I think I will buy another pair, maybe the easy blue one.",IJD73
5,04/24/2017," Got them specifically for the gym.  Very satisfied  with build quality and support, especially when running.",IJD73

5,04/17/2017,"""Cush"" me outside, how bout dat Bought Size 9 three weeks ago. Wearing them at Disneyland! Shoes are comfortable & breathe. Best pair of kicks thus far, cushy ride on concrete is easy on your dawgs, yo! Next pair I will move up to the ultra boost!",IJD73
5,04/17/2017,Ultra-comfortable in a super-stylish package! So very comfy! I have people stopping me asking what kind of shoes I'm wearing. I can't help but smile and tell them how great they feel. Most people just like how cool they look.,IJD73
5,04/10/2017,"PureBOOST shoe is an amazing! PureBOOST Shoe is amazing all day comfort and support! Don't over look this shoe!! I almost did, now I have 4 pairs. Love them!!",IJD73
3,04/04/2017,"Not wide enough and needs more cushion. Nice looking shoe, but there are weird holes in the base of the shoe that are very noticeable. Not enough cushion in the forefront of the shoe. Very narrow in the instep area as well as the toe box. I am a Woman and I cannot believe how narrow these shoes run. Obviously, I wear women's shoes, but I have a wide foot and have had to resort to ordering men's running shoes to get the width for my genetic/sports bunion. These didn't cut it. I will keep searching. I will try the Alphabounce Engineered Mesh shoes. I usually wear a 9.5 Wide womens so I ordered an 8 in these Pureboost shoes.
I was instructed to get the Alphabounce Engineered Mesh shoes by someone at Adidas due to their width in the men's sizes. Make a wide width shoe in both the men's and women's. Make it wide throughout the entire foot base.",IJD73
5,04/03/2017,"Best colorway the sole is extremely comfortable, it ties perfectly & not too tight across the top of the foot",IJD73

4,03/28/2017,"Super comfortable Great looking shoe, really comfortable. Not as awesome as the Ultra Boost, but a fantastic everyday, just kickin' around sort of shoe. Love it.",IJD73
5,03/27/2017,Best purchase Comfortable & look great. Love the rope style lace.,IJD73
4,03/25/2017,Firmer ultraboosts Knit is firm and provides support. Boost is firm and better for agile movements. Ankle support it great only if shoe fits snugly.  Only came with one pair of laces and wish sole was made from Continental,IJD73
5,03/19/2017,Ideal These trainers are very comfortable. Great purchase.,IJD73
2,03/18/2017,"Tongue is a no no. Almost a winner, but the tongue ruins it for me. The look is clean, materials are nice, and comfort is up there with the ultra boost. The only problem is the ""burrito"" tongue. Why adidas did this style of tongue is beyond me. The tongue is really annoying and uncomfortable. It gets messed up everytime I slip them on and the part where it folds over bugs my feet. I really like the look and confort of the boost material on these shoes, but the tongue is the deal breaker. Ill stick to my ultra boosts.",IJD73
5,03/18/2017, Really love this shoe. It's so comfy and looks great.,IJD73
4,03/18/2017,"Light and great airflow. A really comfortable and stylish running show. At first I was concerned by the bulkiness of the shoe but when wearing I could feel that the weight was really light and also allows good air flow. The bulkiness is the only reason I havent gave 5 stars, if this was more closely designed to the adios boost then these would be perfect.",IJD73
5,03/18/2017,Love these Great colours and super comfy!!   Would definately,IJD73
5,03/16/2017,One is probably not enough. Fits TTS and having the knit upper makes it comfortable for my slightly wider feet - toes can have more wriggle room.,IJD73
5,03/16/2017,Most comfy shoe I own! The pureboost are my very first pair of adidas and I couldn't be happier! They do fit true to size and have a lot of boost!,IJD73
5,03/15/2017, excellent only worn them once but quality shoe very fashionable,IJD73
4,03/14/2017,"Comfortable, support feet well and look really cool Blacka nd white Pure Boost look super cool, but also fit well and feel good on the feet.  Could wear them all day with comfort with the added bonus of knowing they look good!",IJD73
1,03/13/2017,Didn't live up to expectations. I don't know if it's just me or what but that bump in arch was rock hard. The softness of the rest of the shoe only seemed to highlight the hardness of the arch support. Also the weird folded tongue just made the shoe more complicated to put on and could be uncomfortable if not folded just right. I really wish I could find a replacement for my Supernova Glide 8's but Adidas has yet to provide an adequate alternative. (The new Supernovas are apparently narrower so that's a no go.),IJD73
5,03/12/2017,my favorite running shoe just added this running shoe to my collection... super comfortable and lightweight. quickly became my favorite!!,IJD73
3,03/12/2017,Go for UB! Pureboost 2.0 and ZG are way more comfy than this.,IJD73
5,03/11/2017, Very comfortable pair of shoes and a great look as well,IJD73
5,03/11/2017,One of the best purchase I made The material is good and it's similar to yeezy's .,IJD73
4,03/10/2017,Good good and comfortable pair Fits well and decently comfortable for the most part. Would buy again.,IJD73
5,03/10/2017,Would like to see a little more padding or protection on the underside of the tongue to avoid laces feeling as though they are cutting into feet. Great comfort and plenty of support with the addition of a slightly wider sole. Boost isn't as subtle of previous PureBoost versions but these can actually be used to run in.,IJD73
5,03/10/2017,"One of the best shoes I have owned Comfort, light weight, did I mention comfortable. This shoe brought me back to adidas.",IJD73
5,03/10/2017,"Best trainers I've found so far,great for training and great for running. Already had previous boosts and they never fail me.",IJD73
2,03/10/2017,"Doesn't work with wide feet. I have wide feet and went up .5 size (same as how I wear my Ultraboosts) . However, with the PureBOOST shoes, you can feel a very pronounced arch inside your feet and that made it extremely uncomfortable for me.  I will be returning these.",IJD73
5,03/05/2017,Very light very fit very soft very comfortable Got the new pure boost in store because everything was sold out online. Chanced upon new released colors and after fitting I knew that I'm going to buy it or my size will be gone. The sizing is true to my size.,IJD73
3,03/04/2017,If only style = comfort These don't compare at all to the ultra boosts. Spend the $40 more dollars for those. They are also extremely wide so the loose lace look is hard to achieve.,IJD73
5,03/04/2017,Amazing. Best shoe! I went a half size up and it still fits me very well!,IJD73
5,02/27/2017,Would buy boost again These have got to be the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. One warning however - get good at cleaning shoes because the bright white picks up everything!,IJD73
5,02/26/2017, Great shoe all together. Looks and feels great on your feet. Would definitely recommend geating a pair!,IJD73
5,02/24/2017,"Wayyyy better stability than ultra boost, Add the ultra boost insole and you have the best shoe ever. Wide forefoot equals better stability. TAKE OUT SOME INSOLES FROM ULTRABOOST , then you have ULTRA pureboosts!!! the only thing they need is an insole and then they are softer, BETTER BALANCED and are cheaper than the hyped ultraboosts. The shoes look firee in hand, if only ultraboosts made the forefoot the same as in these pureboost. THAT would be dope and i would buy  them!! I hope the hypebeasts stay away from these",IJD73
3,02/18/2017,"Very nice Bought this for the boyfriend and he thought they're very comfy. Not at ultraboost, but still very good nonetheless.",IJD73
5,02/18/2017,"best sneaker in 2017 til now stylish, comfortable, perfect for day to day wearing",IJD73
5,02/18/2017,A very comfortable runner that has exceeded my expectations Stylish and very comfortable. Fits true to size. A winning combination.,IJD73
3,02/17/2017,Returned within one day It looked much better in the picture... In person it looks very very cheap,IJD73
4,02/16/2017,The only thing holding this shoe back is the lack of torsion bar and continental rubber Extremely comfortable and responsive shoe. The next best thing to the ultra boost.,IJD73
5,02/16/2017,"Very comfortable, good for running! PureBoost shoes are what I use for running for long periods of time and they are comfortable to the feet and had no problems with plantar pronation . Also I use them for periodic non-workout use and have no problems with them. Note if you are for example a 9 get a 8.5 for a snug fit because the width is bigger in this type of shoe.",IJD73
5,02/16/2017,Comfort and quality working together This being my 5th pair of boost shoes I'm never looking back. I just want to know what's with the second lace hole?,IJD73
4,02/15/2017,Superb buy Super beautiful and comfortable product! Highly recommended,IJD73
2,02/13/2017,"With a little work could be a great shoe. I love the looks and fit but the insole is very uncomfortable.  Rather than a solid foam insole, this shoe has an insole with round holes that seem to match the soles of the shoes.  I could feel them when I walked in the shoe and feel it would be very uncomfortable while running.  I returned them and will go back to the ultra boost which are my favorite shoe.",IJD73
5,02/13/2017, Best shoe! Stay away from these hypebeast!! Comfy and I recommend!!,IJD73
5,02/13/2017,Good purchase Great pair sneakers of sneakers at an affordable price,IJD73

5,02/12/2017,Was so happy with them bought a second pair different colour Good fitment nice quality materials. Wore these kicks all day no show socks very comfortable,IJD73
4,02/12/2017,Great Value Great design. Lightweight .Boost is a little firmer than previous but that gives it a better feel once you start walking/running.,IJD73
5,02/11/2017, great comfort and grip had to return due to sizing issues,IJD73
5,02/10/2017,Please go out and buy a pair of Pureboost Shoes today. Your feet will thank you. The quality and comfort of Pureboost shoes are incredible. These are easily the best running sneakers I have ever owned.,IJD73
5,02/10/2017,Great gift from my gf. Now I don't have to buy them. The level of comfort would place this shoe between ultra boosts and NMDs,IJD73
5,02/09/2017,"My best shoe in the collection. It is a very nice shoe for the price. I love the boost technology in the shoe. They are a very good running shoe but, it can also be used for a casual ware shoe. The only problem that I am having a problem with is that on the inside of the shoe they made they out-sole move up the side of the arch. I see what they were trying to do, but to be honest with you it sort of hurts after a while. The material is a circle knit it is not as comfortable as prime knit but still breathable and comfortable. All in all I would recommend these shoes to any one.",IJD73
5,02/08/2017,"Solid training shoe so far... Since people undoubtedly want to know the differences between this Pure Boost and the Ultra Boost (3.0), here they are:

General comparison:
- The boost is the same material, and the compression rate is very similar
- The Pure Boost has no insole and feels the same as an NMD when I'm walking around; if I pull out the insole of the Ultra Boost and walk around, they're similar to these.
- The Pure Boost is much more laterally-stable than the Ultra Boost (I'm a neutral runner)
- I experience zero heel slip in the Pure Boost; however, I do experience a small amount of heel slip in the Ultra Boost
- The knit of the Pure Boost is soft and does stretch but not as much as my Ultra Boost
- The weird tongue of the Pure Boost is actually pretty good - when I'm wearing this sneaker, it feels like an NMD, but is easier to slip on
- I never untie my Ultra Boosts / NMDs (there's no point); you will need to tie/untie the Pure Boosts (btw the lace guides on the Pure Boosts bind a little bit, just like the NMDs)
- Traction is the same as the Ultra Boost. Different rubber most likely but any differences are undetectable

Sizing (I am a size 9.5 US on the silver foot-measuring tools found in shoe stores):
- These match the measuring-tool. I ordered a 9.5, and they are spot on. I could easily go to a 10, if I wanted more toe space and I anticipate no issues, since a 10 would be only about 3/16in longer
- Same length as my size 9.5 Ultra Boosts
- Footbed width is the same as the Ultra Boosts (outsole is much wider than the UB outsole)

Conclusions:
- I love these as a casual and/or trainer 
- These are close to NMDs in general comfort/feel
- Lockdown is superior to the Ultra Boosts
- I'd run in these before I'd run in the Ultra Boosts
- If anyone reading this is looking for a purpose-built running shoe, ditch these and pick up the adidas Supernovas. Those are true running shoes.",IJD73
3,02/07/2017," Boost sole was hard , not as squishy as the nmd at all. And dont even try to compare it to Ultra Boost, theres no comparison, you better off paying $40 more for Ultra Boost instead.",IJD73
5,02/06/2017,Best purchase ever Go a half size down. Very high quality and very comfortable.,IJD73
5,02/05/2017,"these should be in your rotation! my new beaters! lots of people are sleeping on these but at least one pair should be in your rotation. the length is TTS and the width is actually pretty wide... you won't get that snug fit like an UB... so for those with wide feet, these are your sneakers! if you want extra comfort, get half size up and put in a thin insole (no insole like the NMD).. that'll put it very close on par with a UB cushion.. makes a big difference. That burrito tongue ... doesn't get in the way, you won't even notice it. and if you can, lace swap with black 3Ms!! totally recommend this shoe!",IJD73
5,02/05/2017,"More comfortable than PureBoost1 Got both Burgundy and Black one, they are super comfy. I went TTS, but i think down 1/2 a size would fit better.
Both color I bought didn't come with 2nd pair of lace like some reviewer mentioned though?",IJD73
5,02/04/2017,Go half size up! I wish I would've gone a half size up. It's a little snug on the toe. It has the same great comfort but without the pk your toes don't have the same flexibility.,IJD73
5,02/04/2017,Very satisfied with my purchase. Ty adidas! It looks better in person. The boost is a little wider than the UB and NMDs. Quality seems better than my regular NMDs,IJD73
5,02/04/2017,"Most comfortable shoe ever! Tried a couple of different brands in the store. But, when I tried this; I smile!",IJD73
5,02/02/2017,if you want a comfortable all around shoes buy pureboost These shoes are perfect and more comfortable then any shoe iv'e ever had it feels like a sock love it.,IJD73
5,02/01/2017,Great shoe! Most comfy shoes you will ever wear.....I wish they were $40 cheaper though.,IJD73
5,01/25/2017,"Insanely comfortable! Looks awesome, feels awesome. OREO color is very cool.",IJD73
5,01/25/2017,"Great Looking Shoe & Very Comfortable This shoe is very comfortable given the boost technology. It is great looking and comes with 2 pairs of laces, which is nice. Note: the shoe tongue sort of folds over and is atypical. However, it is very comfortable and provides a nice fit.",IJD73
5,01/25/2017,"Adidas flagship gets the upgrade it deserves! Really enjoy these shoes, very comfortable and super stylish. I have the black/ white ones and they are the best colorway to me. I stay in Colorado Springs and was told by finish line in Denver that there is no market for nmds, pure or ultraboost shoes. This isn't true as a veteran, military guys are a market you are missing out on. Please contact me with opportunity to become a adidas Rep. I have some ideas that will help secure this untapped market.",IJD73
5,01/25/2017,Hope the hypebeasts stay away from these! loving the silhouette of these shoes! Glad I want went tts on these as I have to .5 up on ultra boosts and .5 down on pk nmd's. I see myself wearing these more so than any nmd in my collection.,IJD73
5,01/23/2017,Very happy to have been able to get these shoes! Very happy with these shoes! Extremely light weight and there is nothing else that matches the comfort of the Boost mid sole. They look much better on feet than pictures do justice. Highly recommend if you are lucky enough to find a pair.,IJD73
5,01/22/2017,Best purchase ever Very comfortable and god for running. Overall very good shoe,IJD73
5,01/22/2017,Great looking and very comfortable shoe. Was finally able to purchase a newly released boost shoe! The first colorway released and sold out quick online. I found mine surprisingly at my local mall. I have been trying to cop a pair of ultra boost for long time but not knowing how it fits makes it hard to order correct size even if I had a chance. These new pure boost fit true to size some may prefer a half size down for a more snug fit. I went TTS because I didn't like the added pressure on my big toe. And I figured my feet would like the extra room during a long work day. I purchased a size 12 but 11.5 fit as well though more snug. It was nice to go into a local store and actually be able to try on multiple sizes and make a purchase. Hopefully more adidas boost shoes (hint hint even more expensive ultra boost) will atleast have basic non limited colorways available at more brick and mortar stores. This would allow a customers like me to see the shoes in person and get a feel for the fit. Then we would know what size to order when the limited colorways arrive! Boost feels amazing and this new pure boost style is dope!,IJD73
4,01/20/2017,Great Shoe got 2 pairs early from local adidas store ! This shoe has taken traits from previous yeezys like the wide footprint and laces,IJD73
5,01/17/2017,"Great and comfortable Great shoe, very comfortable and cheaper than the ultra boost so win win",IJD73
5,01/17/2017,"Adidas has yet to let me down the past two years in regards to the Boost department. #ConsistencyIsKey Haven't even worn it yet, and I already know what to expect.",IJD73
5,01/17/2017," Great product! Super comfortable for its price, as well as super stylish. I owned a sample of this shoe. I was wondering if the actual product would have the same fit as the previous shoes? Are they true to size?",IJD73
4,08/28/2017,"These are amazing shoes I love the shoes to just wear around all the time, but when I ran in them, the longer I ran, it seems the harder they got. I will try them again, but I didn't like them that much for running.",CEQ06
3,05/17/2017,I shouldn't have to put hold on quote duct tape on the inside of a pair of shoes that cost so much. She was very comfortable and good-looking. However after having the shoes for only 2 months with regular wear to work daily I got a hole in the top of the toe and I don't have a hyper-extended toe. Very disappointed in the fact that I'm getting a new pair but it's taken almost a month to get them via warranty.,CEQ06
3,05/07/2017,"Different iteration from the previous version. Try these along with the previous Glide 8. What a completely different shoe. This shoe is cater for slow medium pace with additional cushioning. one thing bad about is the heel does not grip your ankle feel like youre about to slip the shoe anytime.

if you want firm cushion ride go for the older version. if slow pace, long distance run, this might be ok",CEQ06
5,03/03/2017,"PHENOMENAL RUNNING SHOE! This shoe has been excellent so far.  I have a wide foot and normally wear 10.5 and these are true to fit for me.  I have put about 55 miles on them (evenly split between road and packed urban dirt trails) between easy runs, speed workouts and a half marathon this past weekend.  This shoe has performed flawlessly in any workout I put it through.  I am 6'1"", 175lbs and running 20-30 miles a week training for my 2nd marathon (average 8min pace).  I am a midfoot striker and can noticeably feel the boost foam and cushyness in the heel and all the way through the toe.  It's super responsive and flexible while still feeling supportive.  So far I am sold and don't plan to look back from Adidas.",CEQ06
4,02/20/2017,great shoe for half marathon runner upwards. tried the ultra boost and could only manage up to 5k with them lack of support and way to soft with no return. the supernova in comparison is working really well for me running 18 miles + at a time in them and they return from the sole feels perfect for me and am just eating the miles up.,CEQ06
5,02/11/2017,These shoes makes running more fun en faster I selected these shoes because of their energy return and midsole cushioning. They support my new way of running to avoid lower back pain.,CEQ06
5,02/07/2017,Best running shoes to date By far the best running shoes I have purchased. The cushioning around the ankle makes any run comfortable. Size is true to size. I've taken these on a few 15-17 mile runs recently and my feet have never felt better. Great for runners that heel-strike.,CEQ06

5,11/01/2017,"The best shoes! This is my 2nd pair (I also own a pair of original Ultraboost). Both are very comfy, this one fits slightly more snugly and feels better without socks.

5,10/12/2017,"best running shoes These are just beautiful shoes and so comfortable, it is like running in bouncy socks! I have a large bunion and makes running difficult if the shoes are not perfect as always end up with blisters underneath it. These shoes are soft and nothing to cause blisters, so comfortable and light. The size seems ever so slightly on the small size, I wear size 5 shoes but buy size 6 running shoes, however these don't seem to leave the extra space at the toes. I have not run more than 5 km in them so far so don't know how will they hold up for longer distance but you might have to go 1.5-2 sizes up if you like more space for toes. They are really so beautiful that if I were not obsessed about keeping my running shoes for running only, I would wear them all the time!",BEY13

Very comfortable and soft overall, but should have worn with socks, as the fabric rubbed against my ankles. Less stability in the heel as I'm used to from other running shoes, but again better with socks. The sole is very soft and I could feel an uneven ground, little stones etc. Overall a very good running shoe in my opinion.",BEY13

4,07/05/2017,"Gorgeous shoe, just too narrow for me I ordered a half size bigger than my usual 10. The shoes were perfect and beautiful with the shimmering silver except the width bothered me. I have feet that are a little on the wider side. I am easily distracted and bothered by shoes hugging the top of my feet, so I decided to return them. I found another style boost with the silver details that fit better.",BEY13

3,06/30/2017,"So hopeful, but disappointed I was so excited to order the Parley version of this shoe and have had decent luck with Adidas running shoes in the past. They do have a great look and you would never know the materials were recycled. I did end up returning these because the webbing which is used for the lacing system is connected and secured right under the forefoot - so just below my toes in this shoe. Because this is a stripped down shoe, I could distinctly feel the webbing under my feet and found it really uncomfortable. Not sure if I got a bad pair as no others have commented on this problem, but I sent them back because of it. So sad.",BEY13
4,06/24/2017,"The perfect shoe This is my first ultra boost shoe. I think it's absolutely amazing. I notice a huge difference in my workout just because of the shoe. I am more balanced, I run so much better, and my feet are not sore at the end of the day. Overall it is a great product and I am so glad that I made this purchase.",BEY13
3,06/23/2017," Wanted to love these, but they are one of the more uncomfortable running shoes I've worn in recent memory. They just did not fit my feet well. I tried to run in them for about a month, thinking they would get better with a few miles, but nothing changed. Will be switching back to the regular boosts.",BEY13
3,06/19/2017,"Good but not Great. Aesthetically, they are great. Mine squeak when I walk in them all the sudden, which is annoying. Also you need to wear a high sock because the back will rub your ankle. Since they have that sock like sneaker feel, they run a little on the smaller side.",BEY13
5,06/19/2017,"Love, love, love these shoes! These were my first Ultraboost purchase, and I'm a fan! Super comfortable and lightweight, without compromising support! I just wish they had my shoe size in stock more often! The shoes were a lot more glittery looking in person than they looked online! After wearing them a few times, I barely it noticed anymore!",BEY13
3,06/16/2017,"Wouldn't Recommend for Long Distance Running Super cool shoe looks wise and fairly comfortable to wear throughout the day or at the gym. When I finally started wearing these outside to actually run in (I purchased the pearl white pair so didn't want to wear them outside) I ended up with terrible blisters on my heel from the thick plastic on the back of the shoe. I was in pain while running and when I got home was surprised with blood all over my beautiful white shoes :(. It's a week later and my blisters still hurt. So while they LOOK awesome, I wouldn't necessarily think they are worth the price if you are looking for a great running shoe.",BEY13
2,06/16/2017,Not a fan I was highly disappointed I'm a huge fan of the boost technology however this one was not made well. Should have ordered the energy boost again for my running shoe.,BEY13
4,06/15/2017,Love these bad boys. I love these shoes. the only reason I have it a four star instead of five was if I'm running in them for more than 3 hrs or walking in them most of the day the back rubs on my Achilles Tendon. So I have to wear high ankle socks. Other than that I really love these shoes.,BEY13

I am a standard size 7.5, and I could've honestly used either the 7, or maybe even the 6.5 with how large this shoe runs. I bought this shoe with the intention of running - and with purpose of going to the gym and walking around / running errands. Would have loved to use it, as it is SUPER comfy - but I'm not sure it's worth the purchase price (plus, it's a little heavy for a running shoe)... so I sadly did not exchange for correct size. Cannot comment on durability or longevity of this product, as I have not ran in them. The concept seems cool, but the price tag is not (especially since the sizing is so far off).",BEY13

4,03/13/2017,"Highly recommended . Very chic ,perfectly fits in the modern lifestyle .",BEY13
3,03/11/2017,Buy a 1/2 size up It definitely needs getting used to the first couple of times. A bit too tight and narrow for my own liking and you'll either have to go barefoot or wear thin socks. I suppose it's because I'm used to my other pair of incredibly comfortable Ultraboosts.,BEY13
5,03/11/2017,Great purchase Comfortable and got me numerous compliments. Love the coloured boost.,BEY13
5,03/10/2017,Comfort and style all in one! The adidas ultra boost are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. The fit and cushion are just perfect for everyday use as well as indoor/outdoor running.,BEY13

3,03/05/2017,OK Too expensive and mid section of shoe too tight. Just a average shoe but with a big price tag,BEY13

5,03/02/2017,BEST EVER SHOES MADE THE BEST SHOE EVER MADE - ONCE U HAVE BOOST U WOULD NEVER GO BACK,BEY13
5,02/28/2017,"Best looking ultra boost so far One of the most comfortable, supportive, cushioned and stylish running sneakers i have ever owned. The shape and fit are streamlined and hug every curve of my foot, supporting every step atop the ingenious ultra boost sole.
Being a staunchly proud devotee of the ultra boost line, the ultraboost x ltd is by far the best fit for me.  Loving the silver ultra boost sole and metallic highlights, these are way too good looking for an everyday sneaker!",BEY13
5,02/26/2017,my favorite running shoes a well designed shoe with all the great features and boost soles. love the new colourways.,BEY13
5,02/20/2017,Really comfortable fit They are perfect and also the quality is really good. Definitely recommend buying,BEY13
5,02/18/2017,"Favorite running shoe Amazing quality and super comfortable! I'd say size up 1/2 size if you are going to be running distance in these. I'm am 8.5 in normal ultraboosts and got these in 8.5, they are fine for me and I don't really mind as they are so absolutely beautiful! They make my foot look way slimmer than the ultraboosts and I love the fit of the arch! Will be definitely buying another color as they are great for running and look amazing with any outfit.",BEY13
5,11/10/2017,"I was being chased by the FBI-CIA and because of those sneakers, they couldn't catch me. Lol Very comfortable, I didn't have to add a extra pair of Soles.",BEK63
5,11/05/2017,"Nice & comfortable! Lovely running sneeks , perfect fit ! Lots of cushioning & no need to break in ! Just do it hahahaha ///",BEK63
5,10/30/2017,"Best Supernova I've ever had I have 150 miles on the shoes so far and I'm very happy with my purchase. Comfortable, great running shoes. I like the responsive cushioning and the good (tight) forefoot fit. The color (blue/silver) is also great.",BEK63
5,10/27/2017,"Best pair of running shoes I’ve bought These shoes are best I’ve ever used, superior comfort for long distances...",BEK63
5,10/24/2017, Great product and very comfortable A++++ and amazing quality,BEK63
5,10/01/2017,"So far, best redesign of Supernova yet. I've worn Supernovas for years.  I like that they are consistent-comfortable but with good support, and durable.   They do seem to have gotten a bit larger over my last pair-or my feet are getting smaller.",BEK63
5,09/30/2017,Bought following hip replacement as I needed stability shoes. They surpassed all expectations in comfort and look. Amazing shoes. Great stability shoe. Amazing support and foot comfort.  Price was very reasonable compared to similar competition brands.,BEK63
2,09/07/2017,Heel cup too shallow allows heel to slide equaling blisters Heel cup on supernova too short. Allows heel to slide causing blisters. Not good for running!,BEK63
4,08/25/2017,"Really good shoe, everything it says on the box it does Adidas quality throughout. Just a little bit too much foam in the uppers at the heels, make it a little swashed",BEK63
2,08/17/2017,Loose in the heel! Loads of comfy padded sole... But shoes were loose in the heel. Even with racing laces the heel was unstable. The shoe felt like it would slip off. Heel was constantly moving around in the shoe. Very disappointing ride. Shoes returned. Awaiting refund.,BEK63
2,08/15/2017,"Poor upper material I liked the boost material on bottom. Having foam instead of all boost actually gave a more firm feeling (which I kinda liked). The upper material is much much cheaper than on, say, the ultra boost. Very restrictive and cheap feeling. I returned them for this reason",BEK63
5,08/03/2017,"Probably the most comfortable running shoe I've had. Light, responsive and highly and probably the most comfortable running shoe I've ever run in.",BEK63
4,07/20/2017,"I think its pretty quality the fit could be a bit better feels just a bit tight around the wider part of the foot, otherwise is fine",BEK63
2,07/15/2017, Shoe doesn't seem to breath as well as other Adidas shoe I've purchased before. Fit and comfort were good but found them to get uncomfortable when I wore them for long walks as seem to breath as well even though it is mesh material. Would return except living overseas make it impracticable.,BEK63
5,07/11/2017,Great shoe I really liked running in the Supernova ST. I've only run about 5ks in them so far and I hope to do so much more. It was my first time with Boost and I will definitely try it again. A good looking and good feeling shoe.,BEK63
5,07/08/2017,Nice shoe. Well worth a look Comfortable shoe. Bought for running but funky styling,BEK63
3,07/07/2017,"Not the model for me too soft, weird bend in the toe box that affects top of feet, heel did not feel deep cause shoes to feel as if they would slide off if not overtightened",BEK63
5,07/04/2017,"Great shoe, good support and has the feel of great quality I was apprehensive to try these shoes as they looked heavy and chunky. As there was no other alternative and the Glide model appeared to be discontinued I decided to give these a try. I am happy with them so far and curious to see how long they last.",BEK63
5,07/04/2017,Beautifully comfortable shoes Perfect support. Perfect colour. A pleasure to run in.,BEK63
1,07/02/2017,Don't buy!!! I was told this would be like the new version of the supernova sequence it's not!! Don't buy these shoes if you're looking for something like the supernova sequence . It doesn't have enough dept to put your foot in a have it stable like the sequence . I have no arch so I need all the support I can get . I wish I could switch them for an old version of the sequence that's how bad they are.,BEK63
5,06/27/2017,"Very comfy Like the shoes a lot. Good support for over pronator. I like the fit, fits to the foot like wearing a glove much better than other brands I tried",BEK63
4,06/27/2017,"Ideal high volume training shoe, ideal for those with recurring achilles issues. I have found this to be a very comfortable, stable, well structured, high volume running shoe, with excellent traction. As I have had recurring issues with my achilles in the past I very much appreciate the soft achilles heel that this shoe has, with support in the heel coming from supports at either side of the achilles (I wish more running shoes had this feature).",BEK63
5,06/24/2017,"Great shoe Comfy stable shoe, great for long runs with great cushioning but it's not sloppy. The shoe is heavy but runs light and quick so you don't notice the weight. It can also be used for quicker runs. So far this is turning out to be a great shoe, not too sure about the colours that I got, but I judge a shoe on how it runs",BEK63
5,06/23/2017,"Very comfortable Well made, nice looking, great feel, holds up well",BEK63
5,06/23/2017,"Best running shoes I have ever purchased Great design, great quality and extremely comfortable",BEK63
5,06/22/2017,Best running shoe I've purchased! Quality running shoe with great comfort and stability,BEK63
5,06/18/2017,ugly but comfy this shoe is ugly as sin but it is super comfortable and once again boost tech shoes prove to be the best,BEK63
2,06/15/2017,"Not a very stable shoe. I was under the impression the ""Supernova"" line was a control/stability shoe. I must be mistaken b/c I felt like a baby giraffe on ice skates in these shoes. They just weren't for me. Maybe it's just the ""Supernova Sequence"" that is the control shoe?",BEK63
5,06/15/2017,"Great purchase, worth every dollar Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, I bought mine, my dad tried them on and asked me to buy some for him, he is in love with them and always wants to go running!",BEK63
2,06/15/2017,New version is a big downgrade from prior versions I greatly preferred the Supernova Stability version of the shoe. The new shoe feels very squishy. I will not buy another pair of these.,BEK63
3,06/15/2017,"I really like the show, terrible feet issues. Usually Brook's work for me. These feel right but I wish Adidas offered this shoe in wide. S Adidas should offer this shoe in wide. many flat feet people out there and this shoe is high quality",BEK63
5,06/06/2017," Super comfortable, good support in the gym but they wear great with casual shorts for cruising around the city as well.",BEK63
1,05/29/2017,"Not even close to replacing the Supernove Glide. This was supposed to be the replacement for the Supernova Glide, but is nothing like it. Higher sole made running uncomfortable, and wider sole base at the arch made it feel like running in platforms.",BEK63
5,05/29/2017,Perfect Yes perfect shoe I recommend it fitting perfect look good,BEK63
5,05/28/2017,Adidas the best. This shoes are awesome very light weight and yet stylish.,BEK63
5,05/28/2017,Just what I was looking for This shoe Super comfortable all around no complaints. Also it's great looking shoe.,BEK63
5,05/27/2017,Would buy again and highly recommend to others These are very comfortable shoes. Look great and feel great when on the feet,BEK63
5,05/17/2017, good quality.very nice shoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,BEK63
5,05/16/2017,They suit me A great road running shoe. I am normally an 11 but bought 1/2 size larger to get the right fit.,BEK63
5,05/10/2017,Extremely comfortable shoe Returning because the exterior heel has a chamfer which pronates your foot out. As someone who already has a slight outside pronation; it magnifies it. Love the feel and fit of the shoe; extremely comfortable except for the heel.,BEK63
3,05/09/2017,Shoe quality and comfort is great but the colors were a tad off from the computer (which is reasonable). Odd color combination but good quality shoe. The maroon with orange struck me as odd.,BEK63
5,04/22/2017, Very comfortable... so much better than Hoka. I run in them every day!,BEK63
4,04/21/2017,Good solid pair of all round gym shoes. Great pair if sexy looking shoes that are equally at home on the treadmill or doing crossfit type training in the gym.,BEK63
1,04/18/2017,"I wouldn't recommend buying this shoe to anyone. The shoe opening is too wide, you'll need to tie your shoes extremely tight in order to keep us from slipping off from the heel. The problem with that is if they're too tight my feet go numb while running. There's also this weird feeling I get like if I'm running on a shoe lace, or my sock folded up inside the shoe but when I check it's nothing. Only happens with this shoe.",BEK63
4,04/01/2017,"Light, comfy and supportive Had supernova's 10 years ago. Fixed the rear heel picking, and added boost means a nice comfortable ride for me!",BEK63
4,03/21/2017,different - and one person has already said where did you get them from the colours - something different can wear them with jeans and tracksuit bottoms and shorts,BEK63
3,03/17/2017,"Really not for me Unfortunately these shoes came across like there's just been too much plastic used in the construction of the uppers, that's not to say they were poorly assembled just really not what I was looking for in a running shoe... I've ordered a pair of Ultra Boost ST in hope they are a more minimal build up top... When trying the shoes on I was really pleasantly surprised at the Boost sole, hopefully I can get on with the Ultra Boost...",BEK63
5,12/05/2017,Perfect running shoe for me. Slips a little on the heal but the perfect running shoe for me. I would recommend buying these shoes for track/ cross country training. It is great for distance and speed work. They can be a little heavy for speed work but has nice cushion for pounding on heels.,CEN74
5,12/05/2017,Great runner and super comfortable. These are my first supernova running shoe in years. I can honestly say they are a fantastic shoe. Would highly recommend this shoe.,CEN74
5,12/04/2017,Lasts forever and is sized like a normal shoe The boost material combined with the rubber bottom lasts for a long time!,CEN74
4,12/04/2017,"Great As the material isnt made of primeknit, the thickness of the upper is noticable and can be annoying long term.",CEN74
5,12/03/2017,"So good I bought a second pair For me a very comfortable fit, a size and a half up from my normal shoe size.",CEN74
2,11/25/2017, defect on inside tongue of left show. very uncomfortable,CEN74
5,11/20/2017,"Best Version Yey I have been running in Supernovas for over 6 years now - long before BOOST was a thing. My earlier first few pairs of supernova glides would give me approx 800km running (80% road) which I was very happy with. Every since BOOST came into the scene, I've been averaging 2200-2500km with each pair (+2500km of walking) - and they still have support. 
This newest model is an extremely high performance shoe which is highly stable, fits like a glove, feels extremely comfortable and is FAST! Ever since BOOST came around, I haven't had any stress fractures training for Ironman races, and this shoe is no different (I have ~200km banked in this current model and they feel great.) This is the right shoe for me & I wont change shoe models unless they stop making them. I recommend buying two pairs at a time!",CEN74
5,11/16/2017,"Excellent running shoes Have always bought Adidas boost running shoes. Always comfortable, long-lasting and feel good to run in. These are no exception, great quality.",CEN74
4,11/12/2017,Comfortable hard wearing shoe My 2nd pair of supernova. My 1st pair lasted over 1000mile. Very comfortable and dependable. Not a racing show but very good for the long training runs,CEN74
3,11/06/2017,great looking shoe Comfortable and light easy to wear all day. would purchase again,CEN74
4,11/05/2017," Very comfortable shoe, nice wide footprint. Not sure how long the tread will last with the rubber quite thin.",CEN74
4,11/03/2017,"Size up for a great trainer My 4th time purchasing a shoe in the supernova family and this has been the best. Great comfort, very lightweight, and very attractive styling. Slight downside is the spongy-ness of the trainer when walking... but then again you don't buy running trainers to walk about in.",CEN74
5,10/26/2017,Just what we expected It’s comfortable and fits well. Recommended. They’re exactly what you see on the photo,CEN74
5,10/26/2017,"So smooth to run in Really comfortable, sleek and makes running feel so soft",CEN74
5,10/26/2017,"Good fit and material Light and comfy. The size is fit perfect, not too narrow in the front which most of the shoe does.",CEN74
4,10/23/2017," It overall pretty good, wish it was more tight on the ankle as the support was not the greatest.",CEN74
4,10/19/2017,"Comfortable and cushioned Very comfortable shoes, fit my narrow feet perfectly. A lot more cushioned than the previous model (Supernova Glide 8), do not a direct replacement.",CEN74
4,10/18/2017,"King of long slow distance Excellent shoe for long training hours on concrete or asphalt. Normal drop and just the right amount of cushioning for me. I normally wear a size 42, need half a size smaller for this one.",CEN74
4,10/18/2017,"Nice colour and the boost technology is brilliant. The boost technology is really noticeable, you can actually feel the support.",CEN74
4,10/16/2017,"Great purchase, comfy as! Good comdortable shoe for everyday use for work. Looks great!",CEN74
4,10/12/2017,"Consistently good shoe Consistently good, 3rd pair I have bought. Only concern is that previous pair did wear through on upper lining (after c.600 km) - same fabric has been retained for this model so that would be my only concern.",CEN74
5,10/11/2017,"Second pair of these. Second pair of these, love them. Not the lightest trainer but excellent for longer runs and marathon training.",CEN74
5,10/11/2017,"Fit for purpose Great, comfortable, supportive running shoes to suit my needs - 5 and 10K on roads and tracks.",CEN74
4,10/10/2017,"Good cushioning and responsive ride, perfect for long steady runs. Great cushioning, responsive ride. Perfect for steady long runs.",CEN74
3,10/09/2017,"Not for heel strikers I've run in Glides since the 6, which I went to after a previous brand's re-design wore the heel down to the midsole after three weeks. The outsole on the Supernova is a huge step backwards for under-pronating heel strikers. After 5 weeks I'm almost down to the midsole. Please, please, please design your outsole for a large number of us who need a durable cushioned shoe.",CEN74
4,10/08/2017,"Great shoe for the price tag. The boost provides amazing comfort, cage gives the needed support,great material and pacing system. One thing I would change is that the the cage near the forefoot is pretty tight (especially on wide or tall feet). I'm sure I'll be able to break in but otherwise no complaints.",CEN74
5,10/06/2017,Super !! Very nice shoes!! I really like the boost  technology,CEN74
5,10/06/2017,"Ive always had shin splints when I run... Not anymore Fits great, super shoe for running. The material is easily cleaned",CEN74
5,10/05/2017,AMAZING Switched from Pegasus 34 and these feel extremely comfortable. Your feet will be so secured while jogging around the city. Definitely will recommend for jogging sessions.,CEN74
4,10/01/2017,"Not what I'm used to, but loving it! I run in a more minimal trainer, so this pair is bulkier & heavier than what I'm used to. Too much room in the toe box for me (but I have narrow feet). I mostly use these for recovery runs for a nice cushioned ride. I could get used to these ! :)",CEN74
4,09/29/2017,"Walking on clouds I had heard some pretty good things about boost, so I went for these. Man is boost nice. Such a comfortable step. When I tried on a pair of shoes without boost after using these for a while, it just felt weird.",CEN74
5,09/28/2017,Comfort+++ Supernova is consistently made and comfortable running show,CEN74
5,09/28/2017,"great shoe, so soft very comfortable shoe, amazing cushioning, feels like you stepping on clouds",CEN74
4,09/24/2017,So comfy I love my new shoes it is worth every cent. Love it,CEN74
5,09/21/2017,"Great! Super convenient for running. Love them. The only thing that I'll improve is the durability. Even though I do cardio only once a week my previous supernova got holes and eventually tore apart on the instep. So, for me my first supernova lasted for a year (cardio once a week).",CEN74
5,09/17/2017,"Brilliant shoes I love the Boost shoes , this is my 3rd pair , they are so comfortable and give amazing support",CEN74
3,09/16/2017,"Needs more durable outsole tread material I bought 2 pair of these shoes at the outlet mall in Allen, TX. I've been looking for a replacement running shoe for one named after a mythological winged horse. This shoe is definitely in the same class and category. Initially I was very pleased with the comfort and softness of the shoe and the Boost foam. The shoe felt a little heavy and clunky compared to what I was used to running in, but then again, I'm on a shoe hunt. It's now 7.5 months later and each shoe has about 160 miles on them. The uppers still look great and no separation of materials. But the tread material on the outsoles is thinning badly. I'm a bit of a heel striker, and the soles have worn down to nothing on the outer edges and ready to start wearing into the white Boost foam midsole. I don't know if I'll even get 200 miles out of these. 160 miles seems a bit low to expect to get out of a pair of running shoes. I guess my search will continue looking at other models of other brands in this same (neutral) shoe class. Sorry, Adidas.",CEN74
4,09/16/2017,Great distance runner. Very soft and responsive Great shoe for long distance running. Very bouncy and responsive. Well balanced and comfortable. Feels quite a bit higher than previous model though. Also takes a while to break in. Looks smart and good quality. Highly recommend.,CEN74
5,09/14/2017,They are super comfortable. They are comfy and not too narrow. I feel like I can run forever in these runners,CEN74

5,09/11/2017,"Good purchase Bought these as a gift for my husband as he needed a new pair of running shoes. He runs for exercise a few times a week, mainly on pavement and road around our suburb. He said the extra cushioning makes a big difference, and his legs did not hurt for the first time after a run, the first time he wore these shoes. Ordered half a size larger than his usual size as suggested by others, and they fit perfectly.",CEN74
4,09/11/2017, On par with the best running shoes Ive tried over the last 20 years,CEN74
4,09/10/2017,Great but don't last Love these shoes. Very comfy and great fit. Cushioned with just the right amount of support but unfortunately after three month of running the rubber on the sole has worn away to the foam.,CEN74
1,09/09/2017,"Painfully NARROW As others have mentioned, these glide boost 9's are painfully narrow. I've been a fan of supernova glide boost sequence 7-8 and have owned  and LOVED four pairs, but this latest ""update"" feels like a downgrade compared to the old versions.",CEN74

5,08/29/2017,Excellent quality and super comfortable For someone with a large foo (size 15) it is difficult to get a shoe that meets both quality and comfort with a reasonable price tag. These shoes do not disappoint. Although originally slightly narrow they loosened up for a perfect fit. Also they are very comfortable and have excellent cushion for all day wear and activities. Got a second pair already just in case.,CEN74

5,08/20/2017,"my favorite running shoes My Supernova shoes are my go-to pair for running. They offer a lot of support and the cushioned sole has helped me run knee-pain-free! If you're in the market for new shoes, I can recommend these 100%.",CEN74

5,07/24/2017,"Best running shoes for supination So, I have flat feet and these shoes are the perfect match for my needs. When I run the outside of my foot lands first, and this leads to getting really fast shin splints for me. I did some research and I concluded that these were prob the best shoes out there for my kind of foot. I'm not the type to write reviews, but man not even a week in and my shin splints are already to a minimum. There's only one downside about the shoe, but I believe that it's outweighed by all the pros: breaking in the shoes was the worst on my shins I could barely walk after the first time I ran in them. But if you need a shoe that helps with supination then I believe that's a small obstacle that's easily overcome within a week. Also, I know that you should always buy bigger running shoes than normal shoes, but in my experience these adidas shoes scale a bit bigger than normal running shoes. I got the 10.5 even though my normal shoe size is 10, but they were a perfect fit",CEN74
3,07/23/2017,"Great looking shoe, just need to send back and get a 1/2 size bigger These shoes run small. I ordered an 11 which is the same size as the ultra boost I ordered previously. I was looking for more of an everyday shoe with the supernovas but will have to return given that my toe is at the end of the shoe and is getting rubbed the wrong way.",CEN74
5,07/22/2017,Love them ... very cushy. Love them ... very cushy and comfortable.  Nice to find shoes in a size 15 for a reasonable price!,CEN74

5,07/15/2017,Will get refund and order another pair Most comfortable shoes ever but had a fault and the adidas stripes came apart from the shoe,CEN74
1,07/14/2017,"Taken a step back Complete overhaul on the 8s and not in a good way. These are now best suited as walking shoes, too soft and unstable for the long haul running that the previous generations were VERY good at. The imbalance is largely due to too much boost, a new cage/heel cup and a change to the continental rubber which seems less durable. If you can find previous models in your size, I'd recommend those instead. Real shame.",CEN74
5,07/14/2017,Adidas have nailed it with these shoes! Perfect balance of cushioning and support. These are the best all-round shoes that I have worn in a running carrier of over 40 years!,CEN74
4,07/13/2017,Comfortable shoe but 1/2 size bigger size needed It's a comfy shoe with good bounce and support but it's slightly too small. I am a size 9 and I will need a 9.5,CEN74
5,07/12/2017,I'll do the same choice ! A perfect choice (boost system is amazing) for a new running season,CEN74
5,07/07/2017,"Comfortable shoe, impressive performance. Comfortable fit, especially on heel and tie box, which allows toes to breathe on runs in hot weather. Responsive sole which works very well st faster paced.",CEN74
5,07/06/2017,Great - but order half size up I'm normally a size 9. These however were too narrow. The size 9.5 were perfect :),CEN74
4,07/05/2017,Buy these! Amazingly comfortable trainer! I've used them on some 40 mile runs and the cushioning has been a god send. Only thing they could improve is the soles having a longer lifespan.,CEN74
4,07/04/2017,"Worth every penny!! Great shoes, comfort is amazing only downside is 1/2inch smaller",CEN74
5,07/03/2017,"very satisfied these shoes are just what I needed for longer slow runs. Very soft and supportive. The shoes turned up within a few days of ordering,which is good as I live in Bundaberg.",CEN74
5,07/01/2017,"Best running shoes, hands down Great cushion for long runs, three strip for life.",CEN74
4,07/01/2017,"Promising first long run. Only had them for a few days. Did a first 14 mile run in them today. Felt great. The 'build' quality isn't great in terms of symmetry, but feel well made. Again too early to say about durability.",CEN74
5,06/29/2017,Best trainers I have purchased in years. The fit of this trainer is perfect very comfortable well made and so far proving to be durable.,CEN74
5,06/29/2017,Best running shoes ever Did my half marathon two days ago in these....absolutely amazing!!!,CEN74
4,06/28/2017, Comfortable for long runs. Bit tight but break in quickly,CEN74
4,06/28/2017,"Great for running Comfortable sole for running, ordered a size larger knowing you need that extra room for running shoes.",CEN74

4,06/28/2017,"Top shoe Super comfortable, light, well cushioned. My number one shoe.",CEN74
1,06/27/2017,"Disappointing I have the previous version (Supernova Glide 8) of this shoe so I had high expectations for this newer version. I was excited to get these in the mail however once I put them on, I was extremely disappointed. The midsection of this shoe is extremely constricting. The stitching connecting the tongue to the upper in the inside of the shoe is too thick and puts a lot of pressure on top of my foot. This makes it feel like an object is stuck between my sock and the shoe. I have readjusted the laces but it is still uncomfortable.

I will be returning these shoes ASAP.",CEN74
5,06/27/2017, Very comfortable shoes! They fit a little smaller than other adidas that I've bought.,CEN74
5,06/27/2017,"Great, snug fit - very happy with ride too. I had read that these fit slightly small, so I ordered 1 whole size bigger and the fit was great. I have a wide fitting, but the toe box was fine in the larger size.

They have great cushioning and a bounce when you run. Very comfortable for short and medium distances",CEN74
5,06/26/2017,"Excellent choice of running! Excellent choice of running shoes, they look great, and it's very comfortable and light! 
Fit perfectly, strongly recommend!",CEN74
3,06/15/2017,Not the best sneaker for me They make my feet hurt especially on the other edge of the left foot,CEN74
5,06/15/2017,cushiony and comfortable! I like how cushiony these shoes are ... very comfortable!,CEN74
4,06/15/2017,I would buy again. Excellent shoe for working in a retail environment or everyday casual use. One negative is the black color is lighter in person then what the picture shows.,CEN74
1,06/15/2017,Not a fan and wouldn't recommend these to friends Part of the sole came loose at the front. Not as comfortable as others,CEN74
1,06/15/2017," adidas has been churning out a series of bulky, extremely heavy running shoes lately. Also, I notices adidas has been focusing on style (looks) rather than functionality. At any rate, these shoes are well designed. They're pretty. But when you wear them you feel like you're wearing lead boots. This is a shoe that comes at 10 oz for size 9. That's heavy! I wear size 11.5, so you do the math. There are other options on the market of shoes that are much lighter and are also durable. I am sorry to have to say this but adidas made a mistake in producing these shoes.",CEN74
4,06/15/2017,"Not the best shoe for me running wise. Not the shoe just doesn't fit for my foot. I prefer the Pureboost ZG running shoe as it provides more cushion Light, comfortable, and durable running shoe. Good value.",CEN74
5,06/14/2017,"Best running  shoes I've owned!! Love Supernova ST !! Love this shoe! Been running since high school and best shoe ever run in! Great look,fit,comfort and stability I need. 6'6"" 215lbs. Supernova ST is my shoe ! Thanks Adidas,  keep up the great work!!",CEN74
5,06/14/2017,"Amazing! These shoes are amazing, never had such good shoes.",CEN74
5,06/13/2017,Good purchase Comfortable and fit well. They look good on feet too.,CEN74
3,06/04/2017,"Comfortable, 'soft' shoe I bought these thinking they were the Glide 8 replacements. Unfortunately not as responsive as the Glide 8s. Maybe they weren't Glide 8 replacements...
Hoping Adidas will bring back the Supernova Glide 8s.",CEN74
5,05/26/2017,"Comfortable, quality and look great! Bought these to replace my 2 year old boost 1's. They have not disappointed, very comfortable, great support and look amazing. Size is true too, love the colour as well.",CEN74
4,05/25/2017,"Good shoes, worried they will wear out quickly Shoes are very comfortable, fit well, and look nice. My only concern is that the black rubber sole is very thin and is already starting to wear down after wearing the shoes for only two weeks. I don't think these will last long.",CEN74
5,05/25/2017, For the look and comfort ..........................,CEN74
3,05/23/2017," Nice looking shoes, very comfortable, the quality is there without any double. But way too narrow, don't fit well, have to get them returned.",CEN74
5,05/21/2017,"One word (awesome) It adidas,the best,there will never be anything like the adidas",CEN74
5,05/14/2017,So so comfortable Best Buy I have got in a long time and I think that you can not spend enough on good foot ware when looking after your feet I have always bought addias from an early age and I always will they never really lose there shape and you definitely get your money's worth for what you pay considering the price of some other running shoes that are on the market,CEN74
1,05/12/2017,"Makes me rethink my allegiance to the brand If like me, you loved the flawless Glide 8, you will be immensely disappointed with this lousy successor. This shoe is a total departure and abandons everything that made the Glide 8 such a great running shoe. Plus, it's simply not comfortable. Why did you ruin a good thing, adidas?",CEN74
5,05/11/2017,Nice pair of trainers. Comfortable. Nice pair of trainers. Comfortable. Unfortunately a bit too big to me - they didn't have my size so I risked a size larger as some people had said other Adidas trainers can be on the snug side.,CEN74
5,05/10/2017,Reasonable price after discount Very light and comfortable with excellent cushioning,CEN74
5,05/04/2017, overall design is good and it is very comfortable shoes,CEN74
5,04/30/2017,"Great shoe My first pair of sneakers with the boost technology. Light, comfortable and east wearing. Would buy another pair for sure!",CEN74
5,04/29/2017,"Will definitely buy Adidas again. Great fitting shoes, good looks and very comfortable and cushioning.",CEN74
2,04/29/2017,"Destruction. The Supernova Glide 6, 7 and 8 were among the greatest Adidas shoes. We had, the Ultra Boost and the Energy for confot and a lot of cushionning, the Adios and the Boston for performance and, between those, a master of polyvalence, the Glide. 
Now, it's over, you can put the Glide beside the Energy. 
It was a balance shoe, I just bought the Glide 8 with the old outsole on sale, may be I should buy another pair, cause i love those shoes. 
One of the best Adidas shoes ever have just been destroyed.",CEN74
5,04/28/2017,Very good - Comfortable shoes !!! Very comfortable and durable trainers and give great support when running. worth the money,CEN74
4,04/28/2017,Great fitting really comfortable! These sneakers fit great and are super comfortable just what I would expect from a supernova glide. The only issue is there appears to be a weak spot on both sneakers where the fabric might rip. Hopefully this isn't the case and it just looks this way. I tried to upload a picture but my review was rejected.,CEN74
5,04/27/2017,"Quality and comfort Very comfortable trainers, easy to insert foot and once itslides it just feels smooth and tight. Used them for jogging and they do wonderful job.",CEN74
4,04/26/2017, Fits perfectly and smoothly around your feet. Very breathable shoes though!,CEN74
5,04/22/2017,"The shoes look great and feel great, very satisfied. Straight out of the box and noticed they were very comfortable when running or walking.",CEN74
4,04/21/2017,Great over shirt! It's a great shirt to put on over a nice t-shirt. Would recommend,CEN74
5,04/19/2017,Very comfotable trainer Bought the trainers as they looked good in the picture and wasn't disappointed when they arrived. Very comfortable but perhaps a little narrow width wise so may be go up half a size.,CEN74
2,04/18/2017,"Disappointed Although very comfortable, the sole started to crumble into pieces only after 4 months of use. Not happy as definitely not good value for my money. Very disappointed with the quality!!",CEN74
4,04/16/2017,"Xtremely comfortable As expected very comfortable shoe for log runs or walks, grip is very good. You can just feel the energy pushing you back ever step of the way.",CEN74
5,04/15/2017,I purchase another pair This my third love running shoe for comfort and wearable,CEN74
5,04/14/2017,"Most comfortable Supernova's to date! I haven't had a chance to run in these shoes yet, but from experience with Boost shoes they will be comfortable from the first KM all the way through many many hundreds of KMs. When I first put the shoe on, and wore it around walking for a bit, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the material on the inside of the shoe. The shoe really hugs around your heel and achilles tendon very nicely. The upper material is very soft and stretchy further increasing comfort without sacrificing stability. There is more of a Boost midsole compared to previous models of this shoe and you can feel right away the added ""cloudy"" feeling within every step. I'm very excited to hit the road with these!",CEN74
4,04/13/2017, Good build quality and comfortable with cushioning to reduce impact on joints etc.,CEN74
5,04/11/2017,Great purchase. Just ran for first time and better than my old pair. Very comfy and feel really good.,CEN74
5,04/11/2017,"Impressed COMFORT This shoes is very comfortable, adidas really has impressed me ever since I bought my first pair of supernova series. However, the only question is the durability, because this is quite pricy for a running shoes.",CEN74
5,04/10/2017,"Best shoes I've ever worn so comfortable and light best for running Super comfy just moulds to my foot i love it, best for running",CEN74
4,04/08/2017, Great shoes with a wide fit and a very comfortable sole.,CEN74
5,04/06/2017,A great pair of trainers They are comfortable. Fit well and the quality is very good,CEN74
4,04/05/2017," Great looking trainer,feels very boosty ! Lots of bounce,felt tight at first but after re-lacing very snug now ,hope they are as good as my adidas adistar boost for running ? A fast 5k will tell me !!",CEN74
1,03/28/2017, For years I was a Supernova fan. But the redesign of the heel in the Supernova 8 an 9 is a failure. I got seriously irritated at my Achilles' tendon. Please go back to earlier versions!,CEN74
5,03/26/2017," Very cool shoe. However, boost height is slightly deceiving, they may fit half a size too small and are marginally narrower than the likes of the ultra boost. Ultimately, very happy with my purchase, would recommend to anyone.",CEN74
4,03/23/2017,Well worth the price Very comfortable trainers and give great support when running. Expensive but worth the money,CEN74
5,03/20/2017,Best purchase ever Best runners I have ever had for running on treadmill. Extremely comfortable.,CEN74
4,03/19/2017,A good marathon training shoe. The Glide 9 appears to be a complete sole re-design from the SuperNova Glide 8.  You should consider the Glide 8 to be the last of its line and the 9 to be a completely different model.  I have trained for and ran 6 marathons in the SuperNova Glide 2 through 7.  After only a couple of winter runs it is too early to tell how this shoe will compare.,CEN74
5,03/17/2017,"Very good running shoe A very well made, lightweight running shoe with excellent cushioning for the heel of the foot.",CEN74
4,03/17/2017,"Very good buy! Very please with my SuperNova running shoes. They look great , fairly lightweight but give plenty of support. Only negative would be that the Adidas size guides seem a little conservative. I ordered 10's but had to send them back and get 10.5's. Also they are a little narrow but now loosening up.",CEN74
5,03/15/2017, Very pleased good quality and fit and stake good style,CEN74
5,03/15/2017,"New favourite product Supremely comfortable, great styling and a great price",CEN74
1,03/11/2017,"Will never buy shoes on-line again. Shoes were to small, to tight, as I thought, buying shoes online is too risky.",CEN74
5,03/09/2017,"Excellent shoes for running. recommend them. I have had an older version of these shoes, the new design is even better. They are stable, plenty of support and cushioning for long distance running. I have trouble finding shoes that fit. This rap around my foot so they do not slip but leave enough room around the toe without being sloppy. From the first run these have been great.",CEN74
5,03/08/2017,"Great Fit, No break in needed. Running the LA Marathon in a few weeks, and had to change my shoes out.  I know crazy!  These shoes made my feet feel like I was running on air.",CEN74
5,02/25/2017,"Would recommend to all adidas lovers excellent for running, extremely comfortable with a nice cushion on impact.",CEN74
2,02/23/2017,Really miss previous versions Loved the previous versions Supernova Glide - been wearing them since they were released (version 7 was my favorite). This new version feels too heavy and lost the responsiveness I loved. Will be returning these shoes and sadly need to look for another shoe. Frustrating when shoe companies change an already very good shoe to something completely different.,CEN74
5,02/22/2017,"Believe or not I'm walking on air haha Not my most expensive shoe purchase ever, but it is my best purchase ever. No other shoes compares when it comes to comfort. Boost + Torsion + Continental rubber you can't go wrong. At just $130 great price. You won't regret it buying them.",CEN74
5,02/18/2017,Very good running trainer Good running shoe good spring in the sole for calf protection not quite a marathon trainer but good style and all round run performance,CEN74
2,02/18/2017,"Disappointing successor to the Glide 8 I have to agree with the other reviewers which have pointed out how the Glide 8 was so much better. This has nothing of the responsiveness of the previous model, it's just too mushy and soft, and the tongue is too long and won't stay in place.

Why change what was pretty much a perfect shoe for the worse?",CEN74
4,02/18/2017,"narrow! quit making shoes so narrow! the sole is wider than my other adidas running shoes but ends there. tongue doesn't stay in place. I love adidas shoes but  they won't address people with wide feet. I'm 5'10"" and 195lbs.",CEN74
3,02/16/2017,"Decent shoe. This is not the Glide Boost I know. The end of an era. Adidas finally changed this shoe...a lot. And in this case it's not an improvement. There's nothing inherently wrong with the new Supernova, but it holds almost nothing in common with the previous versions. The Glide Boost has been my favorite distance running shoe since it was introduced a few years back. The previous versions 2013-2016 were the absolute perfect blend of well cushioned trainer and excellent feel. This current version of the Supernova has lost all of snapiness. What's left feels like a maximal plush ride for moderate to slow pace. The sizing is also strange. I feel like the shoe has gotten shorter and more narrow than the previous versions. I had to go up half a size which only added to the already bulky feel. The bottom line is that the Supernova might be a solid shoe for someone with no history with this model, but in my opinion it is inferior in all the ways that matter to the previous versions. I suppose I better start stocking up on old inventory. I can't stress how disappointing it is to lose the niche this model filled.",CEN74
3,02/14/2017,"Good shoe, but step back from the Glide 8 These are a step back from the Glide 7 & 8. The upper is more constrictive with more pressure points, and the cushioning is now too soft and nowhere near as responsive as the last models. Overall a decent shoe, but I wish Adidas would have left a good thing alone.",CEN74
4,02/14/2017,"Well cushioned and extremely comfortable ride. The product is quite simply one of the best boost based products out there. From previously using the cushioned response 22 shoe, this is probably the next best thing. However, there is the need to order a half a shoe size up as the Adidas fit is smaller than most other manufactures out there.",CEN74
2,02/12/2017,"100km down and time for a replacement If you are buying this due to how good the Glide 8 was, I'd go elsewhere. There are a number of changes over the Glide 8, the tongue and sole are quite different and sadly not in a good way. 

The new eyelet design results in either a failure to be able to get it comfortably tied or a tongue that will slip during running. 

The sole is now so soft it feels as if it has lost the responsiveness of the previous version. It is ok for a lazy Sunday run, but at pace it feels like a drag that adds to the work. This softness will also increase calf strain, which may lead to calf pain. 

On the plus side the new sole is very grippy and durable. 

At this stage this shoe is being retired to my lazy short runs and I'm picking another shoe for those beyond 5km or those where I want a faster pace.",CEN74
5,02/10/2017,"I think I've found my ""Go To"" running shoe! I tend to have wide feet, but these shoes fit perfect. Even though they're a neutral shoe it is very stable and the cushioning is awesome. I bought the Collegiate Navy color which online look black, but in person you can see the blue which I really like.",CEN74
5,02/08/2017,"Great purchase would buy again. Great pair of running trainers, very comfortable and great fit for the netural runner would highly recommend.",CEN74
5,02/07/2017,"So comfortable and great to wear. Extremely comfortable pair of shoes, excellent to run in and the styling is great too. Don't know how durable they will be or how long they will last as I haven't had them for very long for now I think they're excellent.",CEN74
1,02/07/2017,"I wonder if in need to try something else. I don't the material used in the toe box. This started with the glide 8 and now the glide 9. It's a real step backward from the glide 7. My foot just does not feel locked in while wearing this new design. It seems to slide around like it needs more support. I have to over tighten the laces to make up for that, which makes the shoe less comfortable. That's a real bummer because I absolutely loved the glide 7.",CEN74
5,02/05/2017,The best shoe a person can get actually I bought it just today and I found out that this shoe is the best show I've ever had I recommend it to everybody because it's just great comfortable and just the best shoe ever,CEN74
5,02/02/2017,"For me, these shoes are the best I have worn. I have worn Adidas shoes for many years now, I have to keep reasonably fit by walking about 6 to 8 Kms about 4 to 5 times a week mostly up hills, I cant run due to a problem in my lower back which I injured when I was working and when I retired I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, thats why I have to keep reasonably fit. I have found for myself that these Adidas running shoes have got the best grip in the dry a little slippery when its wet bitumen, great comfort I was surprised with, thank you.",CEN74
4,02/01/2017,Great shoe Great fit very comfortable grips very well and looks great,CEN74
4,01/24/2017,You can't beat adidas trainers A real boost when running - my old running shoes had worn out.   I love the design.,CEN74
5,01/24/2017,"Great running shoe Great running shoe, really helped improve my performance when running.",CEN74
4,01/18/2017,"Not quite the Glide 8 but still good for putting in the miles I haven't got on board with these quite as much as I did with the Glide 7 and 8. They seem a little tighter around the middle and top of the shoe, and the ride is a little more clumpy. 200 miles in and I've have worn them in somewhat now so they don't feel as constricting, and they're still a good reliable shoe for putting in lots of mileage during training. But maybe be aware of the fit if you haven't got the narrowest feet.",CEN74
1,01/11/2017,"unbearable I finally worn out my second pair of supernova 7's and fancied an upgrade to the new supernova 9. Felt fine when I tried them on, but after a few miles running in them, I was feeling a discomfort under both my feet arches. Whilst there is huge amounts of cushioning, this was far too soft and resulted in my foot hitting the harder mid cushioning layer. felt like stepping on a stone every time I ran. I cannot run in these shoes, they are too painful. the old supernovas were great - i would recommend them to any neutral runner. the newest design is oh so terrible. £100 wasted.",CEN74
1,01/06/2017,"Terrible update, nothing like previous version. This is a terrible update of my favorite trainer. It is basically a completely different shoe from the Glide 8. The new version feels clunky. They added about a half inch of stack height to the shoe for some reason. The tongue is ridiculously long and does not stay in place. It slides way over to the inside of the shoe. I went through 9 pairs of the Glide over the past three years and loved them. Now Adidas doesn't have a normal daily trainer in their lineup, so unfortunately I will have to look at other brands.",CEN74
5,01/02/2017,Really good stylish design for a nuetral runner. Great option comparable to the more expensive energy boost 3.,CEN74

5,12/29/2016,"Very pleased with purchase. Thinking of buying a spare pair. They look stylish and feel comfortable. Performed well on recovery, high intensity and long runs.",CEN74

4,12/13/2016,"pretty good running shoe very comfy its very comfy and stable, but pretty narrow. Should make in more colors.",CEN74
1,12/10/2016,"Huge Step Down from the Supernova Glide 8 Wow I really did not like this shoe. Going back a shoe generation, the Supernova Glide 8 is my all-time favorite running shoe. In my opinion, it has an ideal balance of cushion and weight and makes running an absolute pleasure over almost any surface. That’s why I was so excited to try these new shoes, the Adidas Supernova (ordered directly from Adidas). The promise of 20% more cushion with only a .1 ounce weight gain coupled with slightly better heel lockdown was extremely intriguing and I couldn’t wait to try them out. Unfortunately, instead of having an even better experience than the one I had with the Glide 8, I had the WORST experience I’ve ever had with running shoes, and I’ve worn quite a few! First, the mid-section of the shoe is so tight that I felt like the blood flow had cut off in my feet. Let me just say, I’m 5’8, weigh 150, and I most certainly do NOT have wide feet. If anything, they’re on the narrow side. As a size 11, the length of the shoe was fine, but the mid-section was absolutely constricting. Second, on the left shoe, the top left Adidas stripe on the shoe was connected to a border material that was literally pushing into my foot when I ran. It felt like someone was jamming their finger into my foot. My immediate reaction was to redo/loosen the laces on the shoe and to adjust the shoe generally, but to no avail. It was such an unpleasant experience that I had to stop a half mile into my run because the shoes were hurting my feet so much. Even more than I am disappointed, I’m baffled that a shoe company like Adidas could create something so great with the Glide 8 and could turn around and design something as poor as this. Adidas, did you not test these extensively before release? Could this be a quality/control issue in manufacturing? Suffice it to say I will be sending these back. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that I did not toss my Supernova Glide 8’s (phew!) and will be very happily returning to them tomorrow morning.",CEN74

4,12/03/2017,"Good comfortable trainers I suffer from plantar fasciitis and these trainers are great for supporting my heel yet comfortable on the arch. The size is good if a little tight across the top so I lace them rather loosely. As I don’t use them for actually running, my feet get cold at the toes due to the mesh material. And I wish there was a wider colour choice as I wanted a lighter colour, ideally white. But I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend.",CEN75
4,11/26/2017,Good shoes. Slight rubbing on the top of one foot which may improve with breaking them in Good cushioning and support. Love the colour. Just what I wanted.,CEN75
5,11/21/2017,"A Bunion'd Runner's Best Friend I've got hallux rigidus, and it's very tough to find shoes that will accommodate a wide forefoot and a dorsal bunion. This shoe does, and very comfortably. With no flex in my right big toe, I overpronate wildly; this shoe gives me a bit of stability without forcing me into an unnatural gate. I've had no foot or ankle issues since I started wearing them in May, and I'm retiring them for a new pair after a November marathon. One caution: these run BIG. Instead of going up a half-size, as I've long done for running shoes, I wear the same size in this Supernova model as I do in street shoes.",CEN75
4,11/19/2017,"good fit and comfy I like these and they are comfortable, much more than the shoes I had supposedly for long hours on your feet. Although I do have to say I like the Alphabounce just a smidge better!",CEN75
5,11/19/2017,Second pair of this brand from adidas. Will buy a third pair. I have found it difficult to find a shoe that gives adequate support when running. This show ticks all the boxes,CEN75

5,10/13/2017,"Only shoe that fits I've been running in SuperNovas for almost 5 years. I run between 15-25 miles a week. I were a size 12 women's and these are the only shoe Tahoe fits with a wide toe box. Addidas, please don't ever change the fit of this shoe. Even your other shoes in this size press against my toe.",CEN75

Different style than other addidas I'm used to wearing but for comfort and helping with my plantar faciatis they are great!",CEN75

1,09/24/2017," I bought this pair of shoes for everyday wear. On the 65th day It torn. It is very unpleasant that the model, designed for running, turned out to be so unreliable and not durable. Іt seems I have bought a defective pair of shoes, because it's really hard to explain why shoes for running is so bad for a daily walking. And it is very pity, that the ""Adidas"" shop's stopped selling quality products.",CEN75
5,09/22/2017,These are amazing! These are so comfortable and so much better than any runners I've ever had!,CEN75

5,08/31/2017,"The perfect running shoe These are by far the best running shoes I have ever had, and I've been through a lot of running shoes! The adidas supernovas got me through over six months of marathon training, and the marathon itself, without even a blister.

4,08/10/2017,Good purchase! I have tendinitis in my Achilles and research and other reviews recommended these Supernova trainers. I run 3 times a week and I'm currently in early marathon training for next year. I usually use the energy boost adidas so find these harder and not as spongey and these are probably wider than I'm used to but they're comfortable and nice to run in. Colour is lovely!,CEN75
4,08/05/2017," Shoes are very soft, running very comfortable. Because friends do not like, so come back",CEN75

5,07/08/2017,These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had! This is my third pair of these. I run a good amount and work the floor as a nurse and my feet are comfortable all day. I have one work pair and one pair and I wouldn't change these shoes one bit. I have wider feet and these are comfortable without needing a designated wide shoe. No complaints here!,CEN75
5,07/08/2017,"Boost running shoes have improved my stride and made me a better runner, and they look good too! The Supernova Boost shoes have transformed my running. They have helped improve my stride and have made me lighter on my feet. Allowing me to run faster, further, and more efficiently. Plus, they are running shoes that actually LOOK GOOD, a rare find for most running brands. I've made the switch to adidas running and couldn't be happier! Damian Lillard wears Boosts - so we should too.",CEN75

4,07/04/2017,Good value buy This product provide really good ankle support. And they are light.,CEN75
5,06/30/2017, I absolutely LOVE these shoes! I am a former Glide wearer. I was not happy with the Glide 8. The sizing seemed off. 10.5 was too small and 11 was too big. The Supernovas are perfect for me in a 10.5. These shoes have the perfect amount of cushion yet are still responsive and not mushy. Please don' t change a thing with these shoes Adidas!,CEN75
5,06/29/2017,I want to buy another pair. I got my normal running shoe size and it fits perfectly. I love this shoe so far. It is light and has great support. I've had a different kind of addidas in the past that was much more expensive but this one works just as well. Would 100% recommend.,CEN75

4,06/28/2017,"Nice running shoes, absorbs impact well, good grip Comfortable running shoes, great grip on the road and the boost soles absorb most of the impact.

5,06/24/2017,Definitely one I would purchase again. The shoes fit perfectly and were comfortable from the first time I wore them.,CEN75
4,06/20/2017,Bright and comfy. Really like the shoes - color looks exactly as it does online. They seem very comfortable (although a bit hard to pull on...might just take time to loosen up)but had to return because they were at least a half size too big if not more and it was hard not to notice. Plus for the price I decided I really didn't NEED these. Next time I'm on the market I'll probs come back to them.,CEN75
3,06/18/2017,Better than my last two pairs of running shoes. Lots of room in the toe box.  I wish these actually came in wide because the outermost part of my foot almost extends farther than the sole.,CEN75
5,06/16/2017,"Great running shoe Feels like running on clouds & supports my Achilles, which I have problems with. Very comfortable, not too snug in terms of width too so the shoe doesn't rub.",CEN75

I found this shoe has good midsole and heel support. I would have liked more support in the forefoot, however a good overall shoe for longer runs.",CEN75
5,05/23/2017,"Fantastic all rounder running shoe These trainers are very comfortable and feel springy when I run. The width is great, they're lightweight and feel very secure. The only slight issue is they come up slightly small but are still pleasant to in in.",CEN75
5,05/18/2017,Very comfortable running shoes These shoes are so comfortable and have great cushioning for running. I always buy adidas for running shoes and am never disappointed.,CEN75
3,05/15/2017,Sizes run smaller than normal adidas model I always order size 6 adidas (and my old pair was the boost model as well) and these new ones were too small.,CEN75
1,05/13/2017,"Adidas running shoes aren't for me Worst fit; high foot plantar pain in the outsides of my feet due to award hard insole in that area, that arches in the outside too?, weird I though arches were meant to be in the insides, where the archs actually are. 
I was really looking forward to these shoes but I made the mistake of ordering online instead of going to a store. Looks like neutral gait doesn't mean the same across brands.
I'm really sad because I just wasted money in shoes I can't run with and can't return them because I tried them already.
Adidas, you should allow to return shoes that are a ill fit.
If they didn't kill my feet I'd have been happy with the looks and quality.",CEN75
4,05/13/2017,"Sooooooo Comfortable Great purchase, the most comfortable trainers ever!
When i first tried them on, they where a bit snug, but once worn in, they fitted like a glove. Advice - follow the size guide before buying, because they advised me to go up a size, guess that's due to brands being different, but you will get that wherever you go. Perfect for gym sessions!",CEN75
5,05/11/2017, I always love your products. They seem to be made for my shoes.,CEN75
5,05/08/2017," Really comfortable trainers, improved my running - highly recommend!",CEN75
5,05/05/2017, Got these out the box and went straight for a 5k run with some off road. Absolutely no blisters discomfort for a pair of brand new trainers,CEN75

5,04/01/2017,All day shoes value for money very nice shoes definitely recommended,CEN75
5,03/30/2017,Look great and are comfortable I bought these because I have tendinitis in my Achilles and my research lead me to these. So far they have been very comfortable to wear at the gym,CEN75
5,03/11/2017,"Money well spent. Love these shoes. They are light, well supported and very comfortable shoes with great grip. I wore this to one of my gym once, I'm sure they will be perfect for cardio group classes. The width of the shoes is tight in the mid part. But they don't bother me as much since I have plenty room on my toes. Overall I am so happy that I made this purchse. Would recommend to my friends for sure.",CEN75
4,03/09/2017,Love the shoe Always wear adidas from 5k to marathon. Switched from the ultra boost as wanted some extra support for my foot rather than just the cage. These are great. I usually require a 9 in adidas but only needed an 8.5 in these. They are also quite narrow in the mid foot,CEN75
5,02/23/2017,"Good, quality pair of shoes I love the lightweight feeling and the bounce in the shoes. Very comfortable!",CEN75
2,02/14/2017,Too narrow I love the design of these shoes however they're ultra narrow. I even tried the next size up and still couldn't squeeze my foot in it.,CEN75
5,02/10/2017," So comfy, great to run and walk in! They were the perfect fit. Other trainers I've purchased needed a ""breaking in period"" These didn't, were comfy straight away.",CEN75
3,02/08/2017,"Comfy and supportive If the shoe didn't run large I would have kept it. They were a half size too big in the toe box, but very cushiony and supportive.",CEN75

1,01/17/2017,Would not buy Ordered a small however the fit was more like a large,CEN75
5,01/04/2017,Like running  on air Love the colour and the continental tread holds well in icy conditions. The cushioning is amazing. Would definitely recommend these.,CEN75
5,12/25/2016,"Functional and stylish Incredibly comfortable shoe with a responsive cushion. The material in the front is a bit thin so that took getting used to, but I appreciate its stretch and breathability.
Also, I have plantar fasciitis, but these provide just enough arch support -- haven't felt any pain while running!! My feet are slightly wider and these shoes fit perfectly. The dark purple/white pair looks great and matches everything. Definitely worth the money.",CEN75
4,12/15/2016,"Well worth it I like it because they were a gift to my wife and she is happy. That makes for happy house, Thanks",CEN75
5,12/02/2017,"Most comfortable stability shoe I LOVE these sneakers. Bought two pairs for myself and one for mom. I had the very first boost sneakers (black color with that tiny yellow accent) which were for neutral gait and wore them while living in Manhattan for lots of walking. They were great, however, as I overpronate a bit, I need a stability shoe. I was very disappointed with the color offerings for women in a boost stability shoe and haven’t bought them for years until I came across these in the grey color and love them! Great for a walking shoe and jogging. Adidas please continue to offer a neutral color shoe. Many of us are not into flashy mix and match colors or sterotypical gender specific colors.",BEK69
4,12/02/2017, Great looking supportive shoe. I ordered down a size after reading reviews but shouldn't have because it was too small. My normal size would have been fine. If the return form had the option to order a larger pair I would have done so.,BEK69
5,11/30/2017," excellent support and cushioning, nice fabric, great colour,",BEK69
4,11/20/2017,"Exactly what I expected (hoped) from an Adidas shoe! Firstly, I wasn’t looking for nor was I in need of new running shoes...but, I just couldn’t resist a good sale. Especially Adidas. I was a long-time committed Adidas wearer when I decided to switch things up...New Balance, Brooks, etc. Those were great shoes and hit all the right notes...but none could match the support & structured fit of an Adidas. So, since these were on sale, I decided to give them a try. If you like a firm, stiff shoe with lots of support, this is for you! Good , not great, cushioning...four out of five, maybe. The downside to all that structural support is weight...may be my imagination but these feel heavy, or heavier than I’d grown used to. My other quibble is the fit at the top, front part of the ankle...at the laces. There’s a really stiff bit of material on either side of the last lace hole. At first it went unnoticed...Once home, I re-laced & omitted the final 2 (?) holes. So far, so good...no blisters, hot spots or irritations. I’m happy with these...for now, I’m alternating between the Adidas and another brand. Not yet sure which I prefer, yet...but I do like that support!",BEK69
5,11/19/2017,"Comfortable shoe Very comfortable, fit size, reasonable price. My friend really like it",BEK69
5,11/13/2017,"Very comfortable Nice looking shoes, very comfortable- based on reviews I ordered a half size smaller and they are perfect- I do wish they had a bit more structure on the top sides as the mesh isnt very supportive, but the soles are great. No regrets!",BEK69
5,11/11/2017,I don’t know why I even bother with other shoes This is the best brand for my feet. I first wore supernova 10 years ago. I walked 26 mi for the Avon walk for Breast cancer. Did not get one blister. I love theses shoes.,BEK69
5,11/06/2017," Great product. Two days shipping
But Adidas thinks my review is too short ...",BEK69
5,10/17/2017, Supernova is a great walking/shoe if you have a neutral stride.,BEK69
5,10/16/2017,"Runs big but great shoe! I ordered my normal size and had to return them for a smaller one, they do run a little big. But unlike most running shoes, I didn't even have to break these shoes in! They were a very comfortable ride on a 6 mile run. This is my first pair of Adidas running shoes and definitely won't be my last.",BEK69
5,10/15/2017,"I really like that they are flexible and made of fabric, but also have other harder materials; I can wear them in the rain and still keep my feet dry. I love them because they feel durable and are comfortable.",BEK69
4,10/10/2017," Good for stability and over-pronation. The boost technology makes the difference during running.
Just slightly too narrow as I'm starting to get blisters on my little toes.",BEK69
3,10/06/2017,"NOT FOR OVERPRONATION!! Despite what the website claims, this shoe is NOT for anyone who overpronates! I believe this shoe would be great for NEUTRAL runners, but that's it. Also, it runs HUGE! I'm fitted for a 9/9.5 in running shoes - I ordered a 9. They are GIANT! If you want to try these, order AT LEAST a half (if not, whole) size down! I will be returning them :(",BEK69
2,09/25/2017,"Hurt My Feet! I usually buy Stella McCartney’s boost shoes and this time decided for a support shoe. They are flat & stiff as a board, so when you run they don’t flex, straining the arch of your foot and pinkie toes. They were so expensive and I can’t use em.",BEK69
5,09/24/2017,"Color different than expected I was really excited for this shoe, but I'm a straight 8.5 and they were a half size too large on me, so I'm returning them. Not a big deal, but I wish the size chart had an in/cm comparison so I could've been sure of which size to get. The reason I'm not just exchanging for a half size smaller is because they are not black (with purple/coral) like I thought, but a deep dusty blue. Still cute, and maybe it's the fault of my computer color settings, but I was specifically looking for black. The color name Legend Ink threw me off as well, hindsight shows me that means blue, not black.",BEK69
5,09/23/2017,"Helped with running discomfort I am very happy I made this purchase. I have been having a difficult time with shin pain. The combination of specific stretches and these shoes, the pain is 98% gone. These running shoes are made well, fit well and feel better.",BEK69

5,07/26/2017,"Excellent value for top shoe For a proper sport shoe with old school chic, this ice cream coloured trainer is bang on trend. Yummy mummy suitable but not so NOW it's over in 6 months (like some trainers), I fell for these runners. However, they are a wide fit at the front and I have changed mine for one size smaller because I have super slim feet. Other than the size issue, I adore these ankle saving, foot saving, stable and pretty shoes for a unstable and sometimes ugly world.",BEK69
4,07/26/2017, Very nice shoe and good for runners needing extra stability. Feels quite heavy but fine once you've gotten used to it. Only problem is let's rain water in quite easily.,BEK69

5,07/17/2017,"Will never buy a different running shoe. Please do not discontinue/change this shoe. It takes awhile to find the right running shoe for each individual. This is my fifth pair of Supernovas. I switched to a different style of Adidas once and didn't make it through my running season with them. These provide the right support and amazing comfort. I highly recommend them, but I also highly recommend trying all types on at a store before making the commitment.",BEK69

5,04/24/2017,"Great Shoe for Long, Short or all day long! Good for long or short distances. I am in them all day for work as well. Been wearing the previous models as well. Some nice improvements.

5,04/22/2017,"Best sport shoes ever They arę the most comfortable shoes that I have ever had. Good amorthisation, stabilization. Recommended for Peloponez with problemu with feet, hill etc. Very comfortable, they run and jump without any force from your side!",BEK69
4,12/04/2017,"Pretty good purchase It’s a comfy spike, fits well with my wide feet. However the shinny paint in the bottom comes off pretty easy, but that doesn’t affect its performance",KEI26
5,04/07/2017,Amazing purchase I read a review saying get a size up and I did I normally wear 12 but I got a 13 and there is a limitless bit of room so I would say get a half size up not a whole,KEI26
5,03/08/2017,"If you want to be Super Saiyan fast these are for you. These are the best sprint spikes I have ever put on my feet, if you are worried about the price tag, don't. They are worth every single penny, only issue was that I wear a size 11 and I ordered an 11.5 and they were too small, so choose a size up than your actual foot because they run small. The size 12 fits like a sock though.",KEI26
4,02/19/2017,"Not worth $212. The shoe is great, not $ 212 great but its great, super light barely feel them. I think theyre over priced. The fact that its $212 and you cant change/replace the spikes makes me kind of mad i didnt find that out until i unboxed them. Good shoe nice fit but not worth its price, you can get a shoe just as good for much less.",KEI26
5,01/27/2017,Best Track Cleats I've ever bought They are Super light and look really cool in my opinion. The most important thing and difference between all the other track cleats is how light they are. And how you can't even feel them on your feet.,KEI26
5,11/08/2017,Adidas are always good quality goods. These spikes are perfect for my sport and always improve my performance on the track.,IUU61

Excellent grip of the line and lightweight spikes. Would recommend to both beginners and professionals",IUU61
5,07/24/2017,"Best sprint shoe A great shoe for sprinting. It is a little tight, but feels so good that I don't wear socks so it works out to fit perfectly without socks. Extra padding in the shoe, replaceable spikes, sleek and eye-catching design, this is a must have shoe for a sprinter.",IUU61

4,10/24/2016," Classic flat~ nice ""roll""; great for running on beach",IUU67
5,04/20/2016,Great Distance Spikes I wear a size 7 in my adidas trainers (Adizero Boston Boost) and bought a size 6.5 in these spikes. They fit perfectly! I like my spikes to be a bit more snug so that a form fitting without squishing my toes or being to tight in any places. When I first took these out of the box I was worried becasue they didn't look aggressive enough to force me up on my toes but after working out in them I found out that they were great! This distance spike has a durable sole which is great for cross country and longer events on the track. I am very pleased!,IUU67
3,04/04/2016,"Like the style but terible when walking on the wood / title / carpet floors I am  very Like the style but there is so terible when I walk on the wood / title / carpet floors. It makes noise like the horse's foot with the iron nails

I've bought it since 2 weeks ago but I cannot wear it outside :(",IUU67

1,09/10/2017,"Not for wider feet! The Pure Boost Xpose was far too narrow. Also, the loop where the shoelaces go through can easily rip as it is just a piece of material. I recommend splurging a little more and purchasing the Ultra Boost range.",BEZ11

5,09/04/2017,Best new discovery ! I have been running regularly for almost 20 years and had never considered Adidas shoes but this is the best new find for me. Flexible fit and yet adequate support. I declare myself an adidas footwear convert,BEZ11
4,09/03/2017,Not the most comfortable I feel like the arch in the left shoe is much higher than the arch in the right which is annoying.The top of the left shoe kind of digs into the top of my foot when I wear thin socks. Overall the shoe is cute and semi comfortable. I'll still workout in them but they aren't the best fit.,BEZ11
5,09/02/2017,"Best running shoes Very cool shoe love them, recommend them to every one",BEZ11
4,08/31/2017,Love the look Style is very trendy but unfortunately had to return for a bigger size so I would suggest a size bigger when buying,BEZ11
1,08/31/2017,"Poor Quality I really liked the style of these shoes, and would have kept them if they weren't defective. I ordered two different pairs and they each had a defect on the arch area of the right shoe. The glue was also coming apart that held the insole in place.",BEZ11
2,08/27/2017,"Defective Second pair of defective boosts I get from Adidas. And they have this odd ""no exchange policy"" that makes absolutely no sense. Their sizing is completely inconsistent between every single style, which makes it even more difficult to shop online. Also, it's very difficult for them to honor a previous discount for a pair you previously ordered, But because of inconsistencies in sizing and defective shoes, you have to return, wait for a refund, re-order and actually pay more for the new pair. They won't do much to help. Not happy with adidas online. At all. 

My second pair on the part where the laces go, it would not sit flush to the shoe, it would stick out, a lot. Didn't matter how tight I'd tie it, it would still stick out. Both shoes. One in both sides (as pictured) and the other on one, also about 1/2 size smaller than the first pair. 
The first pair, one was perfect and the second was defective (glue coming out of seams, design peeling off, etc).",BEZ11

5,07/04/2017,"Great light weight and supportive shoe! Was nervous at first as the seem so much lighter than previous running shoes i have had, the bridge across the toe was also tight, but after one week these shoes fit amazing! Very bouncy and the under arch support feels great! Working great as running shoes and as work shoes as a nurse on a busy ward! Might have to buy a second pair!",BEZ11
5,06/12/2017,Great for running in. They look great and are so comfortable. I'm tempted to buy another pair.,BEZ11

5,11/15/2017,"So worth the $214, i would do it again in a second. It is such a comfortable shoe, and without laces you can just slip it on and go for a run or do whatever you want.",DWG26
4,10/23/2017,"Stylist and Futuristic I really like the Ultraboost laceless. It's a stylish and futuristic looking addition to the Ultraboost family. The black has a clean look because of its single color. I've noticed that others have found the ribbed part of the Primeknit controversial. Some love it or hate it. I found it interesting texturally and visually, but it offers no structural support to your foot like the cage. I don't have to go into the comfort of the Ultraboost itself-it's why this line of shoes is so popular. I think every Adidas shoe should incorporate Ultraboost in some way. So why isn't this review five stars? The Primeknit upper is a different weave compared to the Ultraboost caged and uncaged. Consequently, the shoe feels tighter and less comfortable compared to the caged and uncaged. There is less give and stretch in the toe box. It feels like the Ultraboost laceless runs a half size smaller than marked. You may want to order both your normal size and a half size larger to try.",DWG26
5,10/20/2017,Great deal Addidas has always been a great shoe and have always given me the best fit there comfortable and seem to last forever my favorite,DWG26
4,10/20/2017,Really great shoes but seems like quality is goin downhill This particular shoes seems like there’s glue everywhere. It seems like it’s made very cleanly. There’s even some glue on top of primeknit that I thought was just dirt but I couldn’t remove it. Great shoes but quality is a dissapointment. We have bought the other ultraboost as well. But never have this problem.,DWG26
5,10/20/2017,Unique Looking Laceless Ultra Boost! Been an Ultra Boost fan since first try and have never looked back. Design and comfort is just beyond par. Highly recommended!,DWG26
4,10/19/2017,"Tight These shoes are great, I get compliments on them every time I wear them. But for the love of god order a half size bigger than normal. Sometimes at the end of the day I cannot wait to take them off. I have had them for about two months now and they are still as tight as when I first received them.",DWG26
4,10/12/2017," A bit too tight in the beginning, but it feels so great after few wears.",DWG26
5,10/05/2017,Favorite shoe in the Adidas lineup. DPR is a second favorite. Snug fit. Comfortable. More colorways please! Tempted to do workout runs in these!,DWG26
5,10/05/2017,"Like wearing only your socks! Though pricy, they are worth every penny. Wearing them is like being barefoot + socks. Light and supportive",DWG26
4,10/01/2017,"Extremely comfortable Product is very comfortable. I was worried with no laces it could feel lose or stretch over time, but hasn’t seemed to be an issue.",DWG26
5,09/28/2017, Most comfortable show and true to size. I'd recommend to anyone.,DWG26
4,09/24/2017,"New Favorite Shoes These shoes have quickly become the most stylish and comfortable pair of shoes I own. The Adidas Primeknit upper is amazingly well crafted and really does wrap around your foot like a sock. The cushioning on the bottom is equally impressive as well as sturdy and comfortable. I was initially afraid that the laceless design would result in a looser grip on the foot, but not the case. I have had no issues with these shoes slipping off and wear them almost everyday. This is also my first UltraBOOST purchase and I will definitely be buying more in the future.

Update: Still love the shoes, but I have to dock a star. They tend to cause my feet a great deal of discomfort when I wear them for extended periods of time so not ideal for long shifts or all day use.",DWG26
4,09/17/2017,"Laces are not necessary. I've always thought laces were such an old-fashioned technology so when I heard these were releasing, I knew I had to get a pair, and bought them soon as they were available. 

I'm on my feet all day at work, so I just love Boost. I'm a big fan of the uncaged Ultra Boost and NMD City Socks, and though the former has laces, I felt they were ornamental. This new laceless version of Ultra Boost fits differently than the two previously mentioned shoes, in that the extra banding of elastic accurately replaces the feeling of tighter laces, where the CS feels looser, at least to my foot and in the same size (US13). The uncaged UB were snug when I first got them but never as much in the lace area, and I'm not certain I prefer this new fit, though I'm sure it's better for my foot than the way I wear my UB's (loose-laced). 

I did take off a star from the overall rating mostly because of the cuff on them. It's a different cuff than that of the Ultra Boost cuff that I absolutely love. This feels less like clothing and more like a strap or a tight waistband and there's stitching on the back that rubbed the back of my ankle like crazy and I had to put a band-aid on to make it through the rest of my day at work. That might be just my pair, as I noticed it more on one ankle than the other. 

If these had the sock-like uncaged cuff, these would be my perfect pair of sneakers. I'm hoping if I wear them more they'll loosen up in the right places and fit closer to the uncaged pair I was wearing regularly before I got these.

Overall, they're a great sneaker, just hope next time they feature the softer sock-like cuffs that I love.",DWG26
5,09/15/2017,"Extremely comfortable and eye catchy The shoe is amazingly comfortable. When I ordered this shoe I thought, it was a bit expensive one but $200 shoe worth every penny. Seriously. I am really happy about it.",DWG26
5,09/14/2017,"O....M...G....!!!! Most perfect and comfortable shoes....EVER. The primeknit is light yet extraordinarily sturdy, and literally hugs my feet snuggly with ultimate support. And the Boost sole cushion is unbelievable. Having plantar fasciatias, running puts a huge strain on my feet, but not with these shoes. And...they look fly! $200 and worth every penny. Seriously.",DWG26
5,09/11/2017,"New Favorite Ultra Boost! For those who are wondering how the fit it is, they feel like the conventional Ultra Boost 3.0 with the laces tied more on the tight side. More stability due to the fact that the midfoot area is bit more snug. 

Primeknit is also less giving compared to the 3.0. Due to the knit material used, this does not have the sock like feeling which I didn't like anyways.

Overall, a great shoe and my new favorite. You can't go wrong with boosts!",DWG26
5,09/09/2017,"Incredibly comfortable with a similar feel to the Ultraboost Uncaged. Perfect everyday comfort and a great minimal clean style. Very similar in feel to the Uncaged by slightly more snug around the mid-foot. You can create a bit more room in the shoe by removing the inner soles (especially good if you’re going with thicker socks). However over a couple of days it feels like the shoes has loosened slightly and has become even more comfortable. 

Running: Yes you can run in this shoe but I would not recommend anything over a couple of miles and certainly nothing that involved quick cuts or serious change in direction. I’m a very neutral with normal width feet (sz12) and while they feel a little snug at first, they quickly feel too loose on a relatively fast run. In short they feel less of a serious running shoe than the Ultraboost and the Ultraboost uncaged (no surprises there). Of course how many Ultraboosts do you see out running?

Aesthetics: The Laceless is a totally different aesthetic than the standard Ultraboost and Uncaged. Comparing them is a little tough but the Laceless feel overall more modern and minimal. Almost Apple-like in its rethink of what a shoe could be.",DWG26
5,09/09/2017,Excellent More comfortable than my Yeezy 350V2 Cream White .,DWG26
5,09/06/2017,"Extremely comfortable and aesthetically pleasing This shoe is absolutely phenomenal. I own a few boost shoes and in terms of comfort the laceless silhouette compares very well to the ultra boost, if not better. It does fit slightly snug out of the box, however that is expected given the construction of the shoe. All in all this is an amazing product and I WILL be getting the other colorways.",DWG26
4,09/05/2017,"Unique addition to the Ultra Boost family. This silhouette is very appealing visually and they're comfortable (of course they're comfortable) but they run TIGHT on your foot, so going a half size up is probably your best bet. I'm concerned about wearing them for an extended period of time because of how tight they are. Otherwise, great sneaker.",DWG26

4,12/02/2017,"Multi-color runs large! I'm a huge fan of the ultraboost, so I hopped on the 4.0 as soon as it hit the website. I love the multicolor navy, but was so disappointed when I received it. It's a great looking shoe, but it runs at least 1/2 size too large! Especially on the right foot - the heel slips. So tried to get the 1/2 size smaller and by the time I received it - my size was sold out! Adidas please make more product in smaller sizes! (For reference I'm normally a 6 and need a 5.5 in this one). Other than that - the shoe itself is very comfortable and stylish. Just beware of the sizing.",DWG18
5,12/02/2017,Super pleased!! These shoes are beyond comfortable. They are a little more narrow than my other ultraboost but not uncomfortably. I have wider feet. Love the color!!,DWG18
5,12/02/2017,Perfect Comfort Perfect shoe for training or just to wear casual. Boost sole makes the shoe have ultimate comfort. Perfect fit and looks really good on foot. Would recommend this shoe to anyone that is looking for the perfect trainer.,DWG18

3,11/24/2017,"Size up for these new BOOST colors!! I have the UltraBOOST in the red night (maroon-ish) color and in the core black/dark gray color and they fit prefect in a 5.5. I bought these new core black ones and the 5.5 is sooo small. They changed them unfortunately, so size up. I ended up getting the 6 and the length fits well but the width and the soles are kind of big now...sucks that they changed the sizing",DWG18
5,12/02/2017,Best runners l've worn These runners are so comfortable. I use to suffer from severe plantar fasciitis but since swapping over brands to adidas ultra boost my feet have never felt so good. I'm back to high impact aerobics and interval running.,DWG12

1,11/28/2017,The shoe came with the sole completely unattached! I ordered these shoes for my wife because mine were so comfortable. They arrived with the sole almost completely unattached! Now I have to go to the trouble of returning them. Not a happy camper. What ever happened to quality control?????,DWG12
1,11/26/2017," I don’t like these shoes because feeling too tight after running for awhile. When I first tried it, it was so comfortable. Unfortunately, I felt tight when my feet got swollen during running. I realized that was because of the three strips on the sides did not stretch.",DWG12
5,11/25/2017,"Best and most comfortable shoe I’ve ever worn and I’m 57 yrs old, It provides great cushion and awesome arch support when I’m running or walking.",DWG12
5,11/24/2017,100% Comfortable I love the product very much.  I have flat footed and my friend told me to buy this product.  I know it's expensive but it's worth.,DWG12
4,11/06/2017,"Get rid of the annoying foot cage part These have been great for running, I love the arch support and the level of cushion. I have a very high arch and I love the floating arch. I think I might be the only person who preferred the deeper fit and higher back of the original pure boost. That style was more natural feeling on my foot, like I wasn’t wearkng a shoe at all. The flexible knit upper on this shoe is great, albeit shallow compared to the old pure, but much negated by the weird hard plastic cage thing around the midfoot. These run a bit long for me, so the cage will press on my baby toe a little. I can notice it when I run but it doesn’t bother me as much running as it does when I’ve worn these around. 
Overall my favorite running shoe right now but my dream shoe would be the original
Pure boost x with the ultra level
Of cushioning.",DWG12
5,10/24/2017,"Best walking shoe...EVER! I bought these shoes in Paris, France because the walking shoes I brought with me were giving me blisters on day one of my 10 day trip. As soon as I tried them on, I felt like I was walking on clouds. I averaged at least 5 miles a day in these shoes all over Paris. These are the most comfortable and light weight shoes I've ever owned. Absolutely love these shoes and highly recommend.",DWG12

2,10/16/2017,"Doesn't support like regular UltraBoost I liked the X design of these shoes as it was different/unique. However like written in several reviews, the cut out takes away from arch support. After putting these on and walking around in them, my arches/heel started to hurt so I returned them. I have a pair of the regular UltraBoost and love them. Wished the purple color came in the original UltraBoost style. 

These shoes may work if you don't need arch support, but I found them to be not comfortable just walking in let alone run in. Def try these on and walk around in the store for a bit before purchasing.",DWG12
3,10/16/2017,Great for everyday walking or commuting....NO RUN bought both these and the pure boost for my wife. The ultra boost she loves for walking but complains about the heel movement being unbearable for anything over 1/4 mile; the pure boost is a safe bet for walking and 3k plus,DWG12

5,09/30/2017,"My favorite! I have the most delicate feet. I have flat feet and a slight ""V"" separation between my second and middle toe. As a result it causes a corn on my forth toe as it rubs on the little toe. This shoe is amazing. It is the only shoe that weights almost nothing, and offers amazing protection, zero rubbing. I took these shoes to Peru and walked and hiked a TON. It was the only time I had no foot pain while traveling. Highly recommend!!",DWG12
1,09/30/2017,"I 3d printed a sole with foam filament. Came out better than this This is a sock inside of a weakly milled/3d printed sandal.

3,09/22/2017,"Great for comfort I am an avid runner and I would never tell anyone to run over a mile in these shoes, but they are incredible comfortable and stylish. I wear them on campus for comfort and get a lot of compliments.",DWG12
5,09/18/2017,Great running shoe that absorbs tons of impact. I strike mostly with my mid-foot and this shoe absorbs the impact beautifully but at the same time still makes you feel the road. I could see this being my go to shoe for long runs. Short - I still prefer the Adizero Adios. ;),DWG12
5,09/14/2017,"Great Support I don't do much of any running, but I do stand a lot for my job and like to walk around Atlanta on my days off. These have been great support for my feet. I do recommend sizing up one. I'm almost ALWAYS a 6.5, but I had to get a 7. These are tight, and I have pretty narrow feet. No complaints other than the fact that I have to wear lower socks because of the way the top of the shoe hugs your ankle. These are very stylish and are currently my go to every day shoes.",DWG12
5,09/12/2017,"Like running on clouds I love love love this shoe. I'm a marathoner (though not currently training) and currently run 4-5 miles several times a week at moderate pace. It's supportive, lightweight, molds to your feet, and is all around very comfortable. It's a tighter fit and feels similar to wearing socks. Not to mention, this shoe is extremely stylish, which I find can be hard to find among good running shoes.

I was initially skeptical because of the unattached cage, but find that it doesn't hinder my running at all.

Note that this is not a stability shoe, it's better for neutral strides. I wear them with Powerstep insoles and it works wonders for me.",DWG12
4,09/11/2017,"Great! But Acquired Fit This shoe is very comfortable. The mid arch is definitely something you need to get used to though. A little weird trying it on at first, but I find myself reaching it for it whenever I just want to be comfy. I don't wear it to run though.",DWG12
5,09/08/2017,"Light & great for my high arches! Very light. Just for walking around all day, no running for me.",DWG12
1,09/07/2017,"injured my feet i was going on a short trip and decided to buy a new pair of shoes as i would be doing some walking tours. i bough my regular size. they seemed like a great fit and comfortable. the next day i wore them when leaving the hotel and within 1 hour the back arch of my feet was hurting so bad i had to remove the shoes. i even had a bruise on my toe come up the next day. the rest of the week i could only wear my office shoes (flat cushioned ballet type). i tried to wear these shoes again the next day and immediate the back started to hurt like a LOT. it was an internal pain. it has been 4 weeks now and i cant even wear my old sports shoes, anything that touches the back of my heel for more than 10 minutes while walking causes it to hurt a LOT. i had asked for walking shoes but was shown these as excellent for walking. going to return them.",DWG12
2,09/07/2017,"Hurt my feet! Very cute shoes, got a lot of compliments, but they KILLED my feet when I ran in them (which is why I bought them). I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of running shoes before, they usually fell good the first run. Not these...I went on 5 runs and the last one I had to walk home because my foot hurt so bad. It hurt on the outside ball of my foot, only on one side. Needless to say, they were returned.",DWG12
4,09/06/2017,Love these! I love these! So chic! You get lots of compliments. I might add I do not run. I use them for strength training.,DWG12
2,09/06/2017,Not a real running shoe These were made for women who run but the arch is too high (I have normal arches) and the material is too tight. They do feel like you get a bounce in them but it really is not made for running. I run 3 miles 2 times a week on sidewalk pavement.,DWG12
3,09/02/2017,"Not super functional These are super chic and comfortable trainers, but that being said, they're not a performance running shoe. I also found they weren't structured enough for weight lifting/HIIT (not enough ankle stability). I think these could work for walking/jogging, but if you're a serious runner, you should know they're way too heavy for speedwork. The bootie is also not super snug like Nike flyknit, so you slosh around a lot, and because of the weight of the shoe, I found this really impacted my stride. If you're looking for a great looking shoe to kick around in, these are perfect, but after around 200 miles in them, I just don't think they're a great running shoe.",DWG12
1,08/28/2017,"Dont waste your money I'm not a hard core runner but I like to run 4-5 miles a few times a week. I was in the market for some new running shoes and thought I would give these a try cause they look so awesome in pictures. They felt heavy compared to my past shoes and the back heel is gigantic, there was at least an extra inch of material behind where my heel would end, which pushes the rest of the foot forward as you run. I thought maybe that extra heel was for more support but then about 2 miles into my run all of a sudden the heel caught and I rolled my ankle pretty bad. Took the shoes off and walked home barefoot. So if you are buying these shoes for running please save your money. If you are buying them cause you think they ""look cool"" and want to wear them around town, probably fine.",DWG12

4,12/04/2017,Not a fan of the new pattern UB has been one of my favorite silhouettes and version 1.0 as my all time favorite because of the knit pattern. I purchased UB 4.0 because it has some of the UB 1.0 pattern with additional parallel lines running from toe to heel which I'm not a fan of. To me that ruined the otherwise perfect pattern. It would have looked cleaner. The pattern reminds me of the NMD bedwin cw and I absolutely hate them.,DWG43

2,11/26/2017,Comfy but not durable I've been wearing my Ultra Boosts casually for about a month when the foam started splitting and tearing away from the upper. Very disappointing for such an expensive shoe.,DWG43
5,11/25/2017,"4.0 is a upgrade from the to 3.0 After reading reviews on sizing from this and few other sites that these shoes run big and to go down a half size I did. I was nervous because I have wide feet but felt that they fit fine going down a half size. The prime knit stretched and formed to my feet without a weird bulge. 
The insole feels thicker then usual but didn’t seem to bother me. There’s still room in front of my toes but the right amount. I compared them to my 1.0 versions. They feel almost the same. I’m sure I could have gone true to size but going down a half size didn’t hurt.
Also, these look much better then the 3.0’s. Loving that 1.0 pattern/material  again!",DWG43
5,11/25/2017,"Love the new UB 4.0 I was a little skeptical at first , like I always am when a new UB comes out . The 4.0 doesn’t disappoint ! First off the fit reminds me more of a 1.0 - 2.0 . The primeknit is a little more stiff then the 3.0 . Which I really like . The tounge has a little more padding then past models as well . And my fav part is the stitching which kinda reminds of of the 1.0 !",DWG43
4,11/24/2017,Too tight over the top buy one size up. Great shoe in black that is actually black at long last.  It suffers from a sizing problem common to these shoes where the tongue is not separate. A lot of flexibility is lost on shoe size. Definitely needed a size up from my normal.,DWG43

5,11/23/2017,"Best all round trainer Exactly what someone else said, the 4.0's have gone back to the mesh on the 1.0 and 2.0. 

With the 3.0s triple black etc. you could see your toes poking out the top even though you had plenty of space length ways. It was a lighter mesh. With these it reverts back to the original- slightly tougher material which maintains shaper better and looks better during workouts and casual wear.",DWG43
5,11/22/2017,must have shoe i first bought the shoe with a recurring heal problem. within a month it was gone and i haven't had heel problems since. they are so versatile because they look great as causal shoe and are amazing for running. i wore mine nearly everyday for about 2 years and they are still going strong anf looking good as new. they haven't broken yet but doesn't stop me from buying a new pair.,DWG43
5,11/21/2017,Boost is back I wasnt a big fan of the 3.0 mesh but i still own three pairs.The new 4.0 is back to the 1.0 and 2.0 mesh thickness much better quality.,DWG43
2,11/20/2017,"Primeknit upper wraps way too rigid and not flexible I really like the boost technology and the ultra boost. 
I had to buy a new pair after reaching the limit of my previous pair but unfortunately after three days wearing them I arrive to this conclusion: the new Primeknit upper wraps is way too rigid and heavier. It compress the feet in the shoes constantly. It also keep my feet a bit too warm because of that.
I have the right size in term of length and width so I was a bit confused since there should not be any difference with my previous pair. 
If I order half a size bigger I believe I would have too much space on the front but maybe I should have done that. 
I went to the shop on Oxford street to double check and they confirmed that Adidas has changed the Primeknit upper wraps to a new quality which is heavier and tighter.",DWG43

5,12/02/2017,"Very comfortable and great design These shoes are (imo) worth the $200+, they are very comfortable, super soft and the water beads right off them. They look very nice as well.

5,11/29/2017,"Wow! These shoes are simply amazing! I have a friend who has the Adidas Ultraboost All Terrain, I tried it on he has the same shoe size as me. He let me use or walk in it for a couple of minutes, and boy can I say this is soooo comfortable! I mean this is this most comfortable shoes I ever wore, it doesn’t feel lose or tight it’s perfect fit. I would recommend everybody to get these shoes, just wow! When I first wore it I felt a great amount of comfort and began jumping over and over again and I don’t get tired and I get a super soft landing! Whenever I walk, if feels like I’m walking on a soft cloud! It doesn’t even bounce, and that’s amazing. The only con about these shoes is the price, I bet everybody would buy this shoe and become like the most popular shoe ever if you could lower the price to maybe 180–190 dollars. Just love this shoe.",DWG38
5,11/28/2017,Really great shoe with great grips and comfort. Love the Ultraboost range of shoes and have ran many races in them. Wanted to get a pair for trail running so delighted when I saw adidas release a trail pair in the ultraboost range.,DWG38
5,11/24/2017,Love the new model Love this shoe. The new model is even more comfortable than the regular ultraboosts. Well worth the money.,DWG38
5,11/22/2017,Best winter shoe ever! As if the Ultra Boost isn't already the most comfortable shoe in the world now with this All Terrain model I can wear them even in the winter and not only be comfortable but a little warmer since it comes over the ankle. The traction on the bottom of the shoe is also significantly deeper so it should be nice on the snow covered ground.,DWG38
3,11/22/2017,"Not as good in wet weather as I hoped Maybe it’s cuz I live in Oregon, but I thought these would hold up to drizzly weather and I find that water more or less goes right through the Primeknit. Still, I like the style and comfort.",DWG38
5,11/19/2017,"Really great shoes, i dont regret buying them Very comfortable, long lasting, definately reccomend buying them.They are pricey though but its worth it",DWG38
5,11/17/2017,"Best 3 season sneaker I've ever owned Its a beautiful silhouette on foot and very tasteful branding makes it much more versatile to wear then most sneakers. Primeknit uppers w/ boost technology! If you've owned another ultraboost no other explanation is needed. If you haven't, take a moment to imagine your dream bed, mattress, sheets, pillows, the whole nine just the way you'd like it. Now imagine sliding one of those beds on each foot and walking around for the day. Sound good?
WARNING: If you try this you may never want to wear another shoe again!
 But the ultimate bonus with this model is that the entire primeknit toebox is water repellent. So its the best ultraboost for rainy/snowy weather. Also, the new continental sole they designed for this shoe looks to be extremely helpful in slippery conditions though I haven't had the opportunity to test them out yet.",DWG38

4,10/29/2017,"The boost separated from the upper I love these shoes, I have 7 pairs in my collection. But one problem I have with them is I was wearing a pair of core black 3.0 and the boost separated from the uppers. Otherwise great! (Go a half, or even a full size down.)",DWG38
5,10/27/2017,Best Ultra Boost shoes ever! Best looking shoe and best fitting Ultra Boost ever.,DWG38
5,10/25/2017,Feels like a cozy glove!! The shoe is very easy to slip on and fits like a glove without feeling tight on the foot. It is very comfortable to wear and the Ultra-Boost sole makes it very easy to use foir long distance walking in inclement weather.,DWG38
5,10/25/2017,"Great timing for the fall and winter These shoes are like an upgrade from the ultraboost. They have more ankle support, and the primeknit upper keeps your feet warm just in time for the cold seasons. Traction was a major upgrade aswell. I noticed that the traction on these were much better than the ultraboost 2.0/3.0. Overall, these are perfect for the upcoming temperatures.",DWG38

3,10/23/2017,Good looking but not all terrain. I tested the waterproof aspect on the shoe and it only lasted a few seconds under the faucet before the shoe would soak up. It’s great looking but not sure if I would wear these out on the snowy streets.,DWG38
2,10/21/2017,"Not Water Resistant Enough Wore these shoes for the first time. Just walked through morning dewy grass at a soccer field and socks got wet. Wet enough to be uncomfortable at the game, but not as extremely soaked through as normal PK Boosts. I don't hate the shoes, but I am disappointed. In hindsight, not sure if I would buy these again.",DWG38

4,10/19/2017,"Awesome except for if your lazy. I like it overall but I'm not a complete fan of the bootie construction.  You  actually have to put the shoe on like you would a sock.  But in terms of comfort and performance, the fit and comfort is difficult to beat.  Just when putting it on it feels like an effort and when taking it off sometimes the sock can come off.",DWG38
5,10/18/2017,"An upgrade from the 3.0's About a year ago I bought my first pair of Ultraboost, the regular grey 3.0's. They looked nice and were very comfortable, they were my go to sneaker. I wore them so much that they are extremely beat up. The boost is no longer white, the sole is falling off, there are scuffs everywhere. So when I heard about a more durable Ultraboost, that was a mid, I knew I had to buy them. I have had them for about two weeks now and they fix a lot of the issues the old Ultraboost had. The heel is far more secure. You can wear them lose and do sports because the mid heel. They have inside padding making them far more comfortable. The sole is more grippy and seems to be higher quality. The cage is gone so you won't get scratches and the thing that says Ultraboost at the back of the shoe is made of a more scratch resistant materiel. They have a coating above the flyknit meaning that they scuff less esisly and water rolls off. They look nicer aswell. Really worth the money.",DWG38

5,10/14/2017,Great Shoe Hugs your foot like a glove. I would say that it is the better of two (normal vs this). Would recommend you go true to size.,DWG38
5,10/14/2017,The most comfortable and stylish sneaker out here! This shoe is absolutely amazing! Love the grip on the bottom and the way the shoe feels on my foot. The only downside is keeping the white boost cushion clean! They should make the cushion in Black!,DWG38
5,10/14/2017,"Well Rounded attractive shoe These sneakers have a lot of strengths and it's hard to pick one favorite aspect. I like the mid sock upper, it's A bit unique. The boost is as good as I've heard from Friends and co-workers. (Not a runner but I have sprinted in these trying to catch a bus and I was surprised at the impact protection and comfort in the the forefoot. I've been caught in rain and had puddles splashed on them with little soakage (?). The extra rubber gives me confidence in using these every day. I feel like these are also a fine fall shoe (good timing) and I especially like the fact that the primeknit is warm when it's cold and that a strong breeze can cool your feet after a day at work.",DWG38
3,10/12/2017,"ABJECT FAILURE These are the coolest looking shoes I've ever owned.
Unfortunately, if you are planning any athletic activities these are not the shoes for you. If you are interested in over paying for ""all terrain"" shoes so you can ultra bounce around town in jeans and tell your friends you paid $220 for a glorified pair of house-slippers you should buy these.

I bought them a week ago and just ran 5 miles on the beach. What a horrible experience, they were soft and comfortable on my 20 yard walk to the beach. Thats where the fun stops, after that I was not sure I could finish. The lateral support in the toe box is so bad that in both directions ( running out and back ) both my left foot and my right foot were rolling over the edge of the shoe. I honestly thought the material would tear out on my first run.

High quality, beautiful design but an abject failure in product design. They are not ""All Terrain""",DWG38
5,10/12/2017,My Favorite Silhoutte! I love these shoes so much that I purchased all three color ways! So comfortable and loving the uncaged looked with the raised three bars.

5,10/05/2017,"Premium I ordered and recently received the core black and burgundy Ultra Boost ATRs. First impression out of the box was it looks and feels premium. As for me, it does not feel tight or snug and feels similar to the regular 3.0. I even compared it to a 3.0 by wearing each on each foot. I was even surprised that the ATR's felt more comfortable on my heels only to find out that there is more foam like padding inside around the heel cup. In terms of tightness around the midfoot area, they felt very similar to loosely tied 3.0. To top things off, the outsole seems to be three times as thick. I have unworn 3.0 three grey's that looked like it had a bald or worn out outsold compared to these. I will attach pictures to show you what I mean. Overall happy with these shoes and well worth the price considering the very thick outsoles that will last a very long time.",DWG38

5,10/04/2017,"Great shoe but a bit tight for a thicker ankle. Beautiful shoe with superior technology, however the glove like sleeve and cushioned rigid inner counter makes for a somewhat tight fit, for my slightly wide foot (just approaching an E width) and thicker than average ankle. I wear a 12 in an NMD or a Supernova, and while I could get by with these, they feel restrictive so I contemplated going up in size, but thought that the collar would still bother me, so regretfully I'm planning to send these back, but will give them another try in the morning.",DWG38

5,10/01/2017,"Impressed! I had some doubts before ordering this shoe as I was worried that the water resistant film would make the Primeknit less soft and it doesn't have a traditional exterior cage. Worry no more. The primeknit is still soft and incredibly comfortable. Where you would normally find the cage of a regular UltraBoost there is integrated support within the 3 stripes, which helps keep the upper snug to your foot. The mid collar is very stretchy and doesn't hinder your ability to slip the shoes on. The continental sole seems about twice as thick as a traditional UltraBoost shoe.",DWG38
5,10/01/2017,"Greatest shoe for the Canadian Winter It is waterproof and keeps your feet and ankle warm at all times. Amazing product, glad I bought it. Totaly worth the money.",DWG38

5,10/01/2017,Great shoes for winter Priced a bit high but you’re getting beefier grip And water resistance. Quality you’d expect from adidas boost,DWG38
4,09/30/2017,Winter is coming... And we got lucky was waiting for it to drop since a couple of months... A the price for these are okay... Comparing that price to what we pay in india is nothing... For a normal pair of ultra boost we pay like 300 dollars here...but i manage to cop these burgendy atr from the US.. somehow i thought that these would sell out in seconds...

5,09/26/2017,"Winning Fit is true to size. They fit like ultra boost 3.0's. 
The material is very stretchy but not super thin. The texture is wool like. The sock like ankle opening fits like a glove. 
Comfort is a 10!",DWG38
5,09/25/2017,"wow adidas has pushed the game to the next level, the atr mids are beyond any other shoe on the market. incredibly comfortable, light, and the fit feels like the best fitting sock you've ever put on your foot. true to size. the dark grey pk is a work of art, i keep finding more shades of grey, the more i look at them. i'd grab another pair, if the price was a bit lower (regular ub price) overall, a quality purchase",DWG38

5,11/27/2017,Great shoe would recommend to anyone I just got these yesterday and they fit great feel comfortable and overall look amazing. The only potential problem I could see for me atleast is they are a bit narrow. Over all though these shoes areally awesome!,DWG63
4,11/26/2017,Good quality Good for running so it doesn’t have much lateral support,DWG63
5,11/24/2017,"Awesome, but... superior quality, great boost comfort. I recommend getting 1/2 to 1 size smaller than other brand. I am usually a size 9 on Nike, and I feel 8.5 is still big. will exchange for sz 8. The only thing that bothers me is that the wing of the shoe tongue folds up. Great pick if you don't want to spend $180 for ultra boost",DWG63
5,12/05/2017,"Amazingly comfortable shoe. The DPRs are amazing shoes for running or just every day. This shoe was a little more pink than the picture shows, but personally that worked out better for me.",DWH96

5,12/01/2017," Comfortable right out of the box, very light weight. They're not bulky or overly cushioned, and they don't push you forward like a lot of running sneakers. I've wear them for all types of workouts in the gym. Great all around sneaker.",KEK85

5,10/29/2017,Great shoe An amazing light weight shoes absolutely perfect for those speed sessions,KEK85
4,10/26/2017,"Good for running I struggle to find good running shoes. I settled on these abot a year ago, and they have served me well. They have not caused shin splints or blisters (as some other shoes I tried have). However, they are not holding up well. I have put just under 300 miles on them, and they have holes forming in the inner heel, the traction is GONE, and the road is now eating into the energy boost sole as I run. I dont see how these are comparable to tire rubber, as I should have been able to put more miles on them before retiring them (especially for the $140 I paid) . Also, they feel cheeply made. Some of the stitching seems incomplete and the lining unfinished. I accepted this over time as a consequence of the shoes being so light. They are the lightest shoes I have ever owned. They are breathable. And they do hold my foot securely as I run. Unfortunately, another issue is that they are a pain to get on. A complete pain! With no pull tab in the back, I find myself attempting to get them on over and over, and crushing my fingers as I try to pull them open with forcing my foot in. The heel ends up folding in under my foot, and I have to try again. It is unpleasant, and could be easily fixed with a pull tab. Another complain is the Suede material used on the toe and front of the shoe. It collects so much dirt. I have scrubbed my shoes clean, went for one run, and came back with them looking just as bad as before I cleaned them. (And I mostly run on pavement). Also, the laces have stretched a bit and are so long that I have to triple tie them so they don’t drag the ground. Overall I give 4 stars because they have served my purposes of a supportive running shoe, are good for sprints and long distance, attractive, prevent common injuries in long distance runs, and are good enough for me to buy a second pair to break in before a half marathon.",KEK85
5,10/22/2017,Lightest shoes I have ever ran with. Love them! Love the feel of the shoes.  They are light and comfortable.  No big drop and,KEK85
5,10/21/2017,Love these shoes I like the firm heel and fit is great. Minimal show great for training or racing any distance for light weight runners.,KEK85
5,10/10/2017,"Favorite training and racing shoe This is the ideal shoe for training and racing if you're looking for a lighter shoe with a neutral fit. It's lean and light, yet provides ample protection. The only issue I have is that the side of the tongue can get bunched up and cause pressure points on the inner top side of the foot; you have to remember to smooth the tongue inside the shoe as you put the shoe on. I have a hard time finding performance shoes that fit properly, and these felt perfect when I first tried them on - like Cinderella and that magic slipper. Good lacing system enables custom fit and no heel sloppiness. They have good aeration so you won't get excessive sweat and they dry quickly (removable sock liner, too). I just retired a pair at 921 miles - a bit more than I'd recommend wearing them for. (They were noticeably less bouncy around 800 miles or so; online reviews/forums seems to recommend replacement at 600 mi max.)",KEK85
5,10/09/2017,Best running shoes They are perfect if you are looking for a very light running shoe. Perfect race shoe.,KEK85
5,10/09/2017,"Amazing Best running shoe I've ever worn. Didn't know they could be so good. These shoes have everything I need (good grip, some support), while not feeling clunky. They also look good.",KEK85

2,08/27/2017,"Declining quality on Adidas shoes I have been buying Adidas the last 10 years and at least 1 pair a year. There will be no more Adidas for me. Looks nice, but very poor quality ""cheap feeling"" and far to small compared to the size I usually buy.
My gut feeling is that the quality has gone down on the running shoes every since the McCartney name came on. Must be paying more to her than to quality of the shoes...",KEK85

4,07/27/2017,"Good, but sole does not wear well Great shoe, but the sole wears quickly meaning that you will have to replace them. For a £100 + shoe you would expect them to last a little longer. I run 30-40 km per week. My last pair lasted 3 months.",KEK85
5,07/26/2017,"Very happy! Although I am yet to run in these runners, they seem very comfy and lightweight. One big plus for me personally is that the insoles can be easily removed, so that I can place my customized insoles in. Happy feet/knees - happy customer. Lovely turquoise colour as well.",KEK85

5,07/19/2017,"Very light and comfortable. I have always like Adidas Adizero style. This particular shoe is very light, so you can hardly feel you have a shoe on. The shoe is comfortable, and it has a good width (for people like me who have a small bunion), allowing you run smoothly and with control and balance.",KEK85
5,07/06/2017,"Great shoes!! They look as good as they feel. I am very happy with my purshase, those shoes are really awesome. They are thin and breathable which is what I was looking for for the summer. Plus they look amazing and are as comfortable. Thanks Adidas!!",KEK85

5,06/16/2017,"Light, comfortable, and cute! These shoes might be the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased!

5,12/05/2017,"My go to trainer every time! I’ve tended to stick with Boston boosts since starting running as they’re very comfy and light, just perfect for training and also racing from doing 5k’s to marathons. Definitely try these out and I bet you wish you’d have got them sooner.",CDB64
5,12/04/2017,"Go to running shoe I've tried a number of different running shoes, but this is by far, my favorite. I have a slightly wider foot that's prone to blisters on most shoes. Boston's fit perfectly and are supremely comfortable. I would highly recommend this shoe!",CDB64

5,11/02/2017, Light running sure pleasure to run in comfortable to wear,CDB64
5,11/01/2017,Great shoes for marathon running This is my 4th pair of Boston's. They are a great neutral shoe being light but with enough support for long distances. This latest model is very comfortable with no seams on the toes. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger and they fit perfectly. I have returned one pair under warranty as the heals wore through within 6 months hopefully that is a one off hence only 4 stars for quality,CDB64
5,10/31/2017,Great runner - light but also feel solid Bostons are a great runner for any distance - highly recommend,CDB64
5,10/31/2017,"Best shoe ever Perfect shoe for most of my workouts (for my long runs I use the Sequence) and races from 5k on. Just the right amount of Boost and excellent finish. Please Adidas, never change this shoe! I've got a size 41,5 in Sequence but needed a 42,5 in this one with the latest version.",CDB64
4,10/21/2017,Great Shoes. Super light and comfortable. The weight of the shoes really supports a longer distance.,CDB64
5,10/17/2017,Sound quality training shoes Comfortable lightweight shoes ideal for training and racing,CDB64
3,10/14/2017,"Solid 10K to Marathon shoe, but I bet it's lower than 10mm drop It's a good shoe. Boost provides excellent cushioning. But every time I wear this, I get achilles tenderness. I suspect it's lower than the 10mm drop claimed in the details about the shoe. Nothing wrong with lower drop shoes, but I wanted a standard drop 10-12mm, and I really don't think this stack height description is accurate. Aside from that, it's an excellent, light-enough option for races up to a marathon, and a great every day trainer if you're a sub-3 marathoner.",CDB64
5,10/06/2017,Very comfy and light Love the Boston running shoes for mileage and longer sessions. Thankfully adidas haven't messed with a winning design so I can rely on them to be good every time I buy them,CDB64

4,09/29/2017,Great lightweight yet cushioned trainers Only issue with the Bostons was with a frayed lace otherwise 5 stars. Customer service was excellent to address the problem.,CDB64
5,09/27/2017,"Go to long distance lightweight shoe This is the first boost product I ever owned, and when I put them on, I wasn't totally changed as many say. I will say now that I have tryed Adidas's other boost shoes, it's implementation here wasn't the ""most squishy"". It was, however, the most springy. Everyone compares boost to the ultraboost for running, but I have to say that I would take these any day. The Boston 6 is super light! Even for a shoe with boost. I didn't notice the boost ""in every step"". Rather, I noticed how great my feet and legs felt after a run as compared to other clunky running shoes. It was as if I didn't have to try as hard to pick up my feet after striking the ground. The shoes really protected my joints! I have ran over 400 miles in these, and they still feel really great, with the boost not even losing its form. This is one of my favorite running shoes ever, and I highly suggest you try it.",CDB64
5,09/20/2017," I use this shoe for racing.  Unfortunately, unable to find a size 13 anywhere!  Went to Amazon and couldnt find any.  I hope the Boston 7 is coming out soon otherwise I will need go to another mfg for my racing shoe.  Not sure why adidas doesnt make more of these.",CDB64

5,09/07/2017,"Great shoes I have run in Bostons since 2010 when the Boston 2 was introduced. The shoes have changed hugely over the years and iterations but with the introduction of the boost technolgy in the Boston 5 they are for me the best shoe you can buy.

5,08/15/2017,"Go to marathon/training shoe I've been running in iterations of the Boston Boost for more than 2 years now, doing 4 marathon builds and about 7,000 or so kms in them. Without a doubt these are my go to shoe. The Boston 5 is the best version of the shoe so far. It's a bit wider than before, and the new mesh material is great. The Bostons have a nice firm feel of the road (not squishy and over-cushioned). And of course the Boost comes as advertised: the energy return on toe off is obvious. I usually go a half size up to get a bit of extra room in the toe but otherwise fit great. They always comes in great colour ways too. An awesome shoe!",CDB64
5,08/07/2017,Great running shoes Perfect for training and racing. Lightweight and comfortable with or without socks.,CDB64

5,07/21/2017,"If you run up to 21k's and dont have the budget for several shoes then this is the shoe for you, it is a superb all rounder. Locked down suppotive feel. Great toe off. Responsive cushioning. Would suggest if you are a beginner/intermediate this is a half marathon shoe for you not a full. Other than that this sjoe is great for 5k's up to 21k for the average runner. Elite runners, a full marathon shoe.",CDB64
4,07/04/2017,"Well worth it. It's a proper running shoe, had the ultra Boost but was two soft for marathon runs.",CDB64

5,11/20/2017,"Best purchase ever I have a hard time finding sneakers to fit me and I am very picky on my sneakers. They have to be light yet give enough cushion for my running.

4,10/08/2017,Looking forward to getting the larger size These shoes are just beautiful: aesthetically they're one of the best pair of shoes I've bought. Quite narrow (although that's nice in a running shoe) and a little small (so I've had to send these back and order the larger size so fingers crossed). The grip on the sole is extensive and perfect for slippy conditions and the mesh on the side might make them very breathable if not-waterproof.,CDB65
2,09/30/2017," Size running small, the shoe look solid but leak of new design idea.
Mesh on the front, no rain repel, not recommended",CDB65
3,09/28/2017,"Lightweight, supportive but not enough boost The trainer is very lightweight and they feel supportive on running.
I previously owned the ultra boost and the boost on these shoes are not noticeable at all. The inside instep on the shoe is also built up quite high which caused me inside arch pain after approx 2 miles.",CDB65
3,09/23/2017, Had to order a size and a half bigger to get the length but then the width was far too wide,CDB65

5,06/26/2017,Best marathon shoe I have tried thus far. I have ran 2 marathons in this shoe so I know it is good quality and reliable. I also PB'd both times wearing this shoe.,CDB65
5,06/10/2017,Love these lightweight shoes! Really lightweight- I'm used to an Adidas ultraboost ST and these are a great contrast for shorter runs where I need less support. Highly recommend,CDB65

3,12/05/2017, Good price and quality! Shoes is comfortable!My daughter loves it!,CDN40
3,12/05/2017," It's ok with this price, I think it's almost like the adults'",CDN40
2,11/14/2017,It's probably a great product if it fits. It doesn't fit my grand baby. It could of been a little better fit if I got the right size. if you would exchange them I would be very happy thanks!,CDN40
4,10/15/2017,A little bulky Cute shoes. Just bulkier than I thought. The shoes laces are awful though. No stretch and come undone all the time.,CDN40
5,09/20/2017,"Adidas is still my favorite brand. My kid likes the shoe, she thinks she is real cool in them.",CDN40
5,09/09/2017,Perfect shoe for the little man Love the shoes and so does the little man wearing them,CDN40

5,12/06/2017,"Great shoes These sneakers are really comfy, I had to buy 1/2 size down because they run a little big. I'm usually a 6.5 and I ordered 6 in these and they fit me perfectly.",BDZ40
3,12/05/2017," I bought this pair online without trying the size in a store. After reading all the comments, I decided to buy 0.5 size smaller. My normal shoe size is 6 and I ordered 5.5. Now I have to return for a my actual size. The 5.5 is fitted with absolutely zero room for socks. I think the 6 would be perfect. So choose your normal shoe size and not size down.",BDZ40
5,12/05/2017,"Very comfortable shoes If you are looking for stylish and comfortable shoes, this pair are perfect for you.",BDZ40
4,12/05/2017,"The shoes were a great deal. These shoes aren’t as comfy as others I’ve worn, but they have worked well for the short runs I do on the treadmill.",BDZ40
4,12/05/2017,Great running shoes I ordered half size down and this shoes fit perfectly.,BDZ40
5,12/05/2017,Nice I like the product very comfortable and amazing shoes,BDZ40
1,12/04/2017,Too big I was looking forwarded to receiving my first pair of adidas. Unfortunately they’re too big and I can’t returned them because they’re final sell. I ordered 6.5 more like 7.5 extremely disappointed.,BDZ40
1,11/30/2017,WAY TOO BIG WAY TOO BIG!!!!! So annoyed that I need to get a whole size down from what I bought,BDZ40
3,11/28/2017,Sending back I have worn same size running shoe for 25 years. These are huge!,BDZ40
5,11/25/2017,"A little narrow but worthwhile The fit is a little narrow so I recommend ordering half a size up if you have a wide foot. Otherwise, it's a great purchase! I have very week ankles and knees after a series of injuries and hereditary issues and these shows have helped provide my ankles with the support they need and also have helped my knees by cushioning my walk!! Good for long distance walks and jogging, and supportive when jumping and hiking!",BDZ40
5,11/23/2017,Comfortable and looks good! This is my fourth pair of alpha bounce shoes. I find them very comfortable (they have no inside seams as they have a sock like liner and great cushioning in the sole).  I find them good for either walking or running. They are a quality shoe,BDZ40
5,11/16/2017,"By far the best shoes Bought them for gym. Really comfortable and looking great. Colour is perfect, matches any other colours. I belive these shoues are slightly wider, that makes them even more comfortable.",BDZ40
5,11/06/2017,"REALLY STLISH AND SUPER COMFORTABLE These are exactly what I was looking for - a stylish pair of real running shoes that i don't feel weird about grabbing a coffee in after a morning on the trails. Ive always felt forced into a clunky unflattering shoes, usually donned in bright colors that were never ""me"" because thats whats usually available for women. We get rainbows and men get the sleek, unassuming ""cool"" shoes. Well needless to say, i am very happy with this purchase. The color is a cool oatmeal - not white. Which is fine for me, i love them. And also the other reviews are correct. these run BIG. I ordered 1/2 size down (i wear a 6.5 so i ordered a 6) and the fit is still roomy enough so that they fit but I can comfortably wear socks with them when needed. Definitely order a full size down if you want these true to fit (not wearing them with socks) or snug.",BDZ40
5,11/04/2017,Best shoe I have ever put on my foot Very comfortable and very nice. Fit perfectly and have never worn a more comfortable shoe,BDZ40

4,09/23/2017,Great mileage shoe. Needs more stability on the sides. Trail runners need more form.,BDZ40
5,09/08/2017,Love this shoe I love this sneaker and it's very comfortable and the price is great keep it coming with colors and styles,BDZ40
3,09/07/2017,"Quality is iffy These are easily the most comfortable shoes to run in, however, due to the toe cap coming off on my left shoe already (have had for a little over a month) I have to rate 3 stars. I'm usually a 6.5, 5.5 fit great. Recommend sizing down half to whole size down.",BDZ40
5,09/02/2017,"Great shoe, I have received many compliments! The fact that they come in this shade of pink was my main draw, but they are also very comfortable shoes with lots of bounce.",BDZ40
5,08/27/2017,"Best fit, best form, best function Been on the search for months to find new running shoes that are not only comfortable but cute af. These are them.",BDZ40

4,08/05/2017, Super light weight. Super cute. Really liked them to walk in.,BDZ40
5,07/29/2017,Money well spent The shoe is really comfortable and looks just as good. Looks better on than in pictures runs a little big so maybe go a half size down but other than that it's a purchase you won't regret.,BDZ40
5,07/15/2017,Awesome running shoes - I want another pair! I love these running shoes! They provide great support and are light. I want them in grey too!,BDZ40
4,07/10/2017," I love these shoes! I have a job that requires me to be on my feet for 8-12 hours at a time, and these provide perfect support.  Definitely go down a half a size from what you normally wear - they run large.",BDZ40
5,07/07/2017, This is a great shoe for running. Would definitely recommend going almost a full size down.,BDZ40
3,07/03/2017," I love my other pair of alphabounce shoes, but there fit completely different. They're not as comfortable. Adidas has since added better photos, but when I ordered them they were shown to be an ice light pink, but they're very bright almost neon peach",BDZ40
2,07/01/2017,not comfortable The shoe looks nice. It's not as comfortable as I was expecting it to be. I would return them but I've already worn them quite a bit in hopes that I would break them in.,BDZ40
5,06/29/2017,"I have an excellent experience opinion about adidas quality I like the product and the style, however, I did not wear the shoes yet. I rather wait to give my opinion later",BDZ40
5,06/23/2017,"Great shoes for high impact They are stylish, comfortable and work great for my HIIT class I take. They run big so order a 1/2 size down. Most comfortable pair of athletic shoes I own. Well worth the price.",BDZ40
1,06/13/2017,"Nice shoe, but way too large These are HUGE! I am a size 8. I ordered a 7.5 and they were still way too large. This is the 5th pair of shoes I'm returning due to sizing issues. Unfortunately I paid with a gift card, so Adidas won't refund my money. So disappointed.",BDZ40
5,06/12/2017,"Buy these, the pink is CASH I'd give this 10 stars if I could, incredibly comfortable and honestly makes running easier and I hate cardio!",BDZ40
5,06/04/2017,best purchase because is really nice de model and is confterble.,BDZ40
2,05/27/2017,not the same color as picture Good shoe. But the color is nothing like the pink in the picture. In real life they are almost neon pink. Was very disappointed,BDZ40
5,05/27/2017,Gorgeous everyday shoes Pink is brighter than pictured but still loving it,BDZ40
1,05/15/2017, They are Beautiful shoes just huge I'm a size 7 and it probably fits a size 9... was really upset !,BDZ40

4,12/02/2017,Great looking shoe and very comfortable for everyday wear Lots of cushion but not much stability. Would choose another shoe for distance running.,BDZ26
5,11/24/2017,Sporty and Stylish These are seriously the nicest looking running shoes I've ever bought. The red was gorgeous and vibrant when I opened the box.,BDZ26

5,08/28/2017, These shoes are very comfortable and look nice. I feel like I am wearing slippers.,BDZ26
5,08/23/2017,Comfortable shoe Bought this for my son who has to wear custom inserts for his new school shoes. He loves these shoes and says they are one of the most comfortable pair he's ever worn. Comfort is important to someone who has to use inserts and is so active. I would definitely buy another pair.,BDZ26
5,08/20/2017,"Perfect balance of comfort and support. High quality, form, function, and style. I have plantar fasciitis and walk a lot, so the right shoe is important.",BDZ26

1,07/19/2017, the photos are all of a light blue shoe and yet the color that comes in is bright red? i thought i was buying the product the pictures were selling me.,BDZ26
4,07/16/2017,"Worth it Extremely comfortable, versatile, breathable, true to size. want them in a second colour!",BDZ26
5,07/14/2017,"Light, comfortable and a great looking shoe is my kind of purchase Looking for the most comfortable running shoe you can find - then this is the one. Like walking on clouds and it looks amazing too",BDZ26
3,07/01/2017,Okay They aren't comfy as Ultra boost but will do for half the price,BDZ26
5,06/04/2017,Feels like I'm flying! This is a great runner and it's definitely worth it,BDZ26
1,12/05/2017,Not good This shoe is rock hard. Feels like your walking on concrete,CDN45
1,12/02/2017," Okay for price , nothing major about the shoe, the design is good but not comfortable",CDN45
5,11/26/2017,These shoes are Amazing! Such high quality materials in such a budget friendly option. Fresh and clean appearance. Highly recomend this color wave not the same as the others avalible!,CDN45
5,11/26/2017,"Wasn't expecting too much, but...these shoes are THE MOST COMFORTABLE I have ever worn This pair of shoes make my feet feel like they are floating on air! Seriously, they are insanely comfortable and cushioning. I am ordering another pair for sure.",CDN45
2,11/19/2017,The shoes are great in appearance and construction. The problem is that the Alphabounce shoes are just too narrow to be comfortable to run and work o Unfortunately I do not like the shoes because they are too narrow to comfortably workout in.,CDN45
4,11/22/2017," Perfect allday shoes, Will buy it in other colours too",CDN46
4,11/15/2017,Love the look and feel Love everything about this shoes besides it being a little narrow. Might have to get a pair a size bigger,CDN46
5,11/06/2017,product was as described Good quality show and exactly what I was looking for,CDN46
5,11/05/2017,"Amazing look, last forever. Despite being one of their cheapest lines, Alphabounces are the best quality shoes Adidas makes. I've worn a pair almost daily for a year and there is not a sign of wear on them where most shoes in this price range have fallen apart. These are built similarly and with regular cleaning can last a very long time.",CDN46
4,11/04/2017,I wish they came in a wider width Well made..Potentially very comfortable if wider width,CDN46
5,10/31/2017,"Super clean, stylish, and comfortable I love the clean white look of the shoes. They are beyond comfortable. I also look good with almost anything I wear.",CDN46
5,10/26/2017,"Lightweight and comfortable Already owned the black so bought the white to match, they’re that nice.",CDN46
5,10/21/2017,Best shoes I've ever had Bought these shoes for the gym and have not looked back they're the best and most comfiest shoes Ive ever owned,CDN46
5,12/05/2017,"they make my legs look really nice and are so comfy great for the gym, also for a casual runner like myself, they are very comfortable,",CDN47
5,11/27/2017,"Amazing! These shoes are so comfortable and make running so much easier!! I feel like I’m walking on air whenever I wear them; and they’ve been my go-to nearly every day now. Unfortunately they do stain easily, so if that’s a concern of yours I would recommend a different color. Otherwise, I love these!!! :)",CDN47
5,11/08/2017, Not as comfortable as ultra boost and i little bigger then my size,CDN47
4,12/05/2017,"Unusual,cool shoe. I bought these as a backup when my first choice wasn’t available. They arrived & I was pleasantly surprised. The inner sock lends to a great fit & while they have the look of wetsuit shoes(?) they’re cool enough to get noticed. They’ll get some comments.",BDZ11
5,12/05/2017, Quality and comfortable is good and that’s what i look for!,BDZ11
5,12/04/2017," This boot is stylish with a unique look. It fits the foot snuggly and when called upon to deliver sports movements just zip it up. 
I bought them for the cold winter months and I can safely say they are like slippers, keeping my feet warm as well as dry. Great utility shoe at any price.",BDZ11
1,12/04/2017, I’d like to send them back. I wish they were all black. I was turned by the grey overtone of the sneaker.,BDZ11
5,12/03/2017,Exactly what I was looking for in a warmer shoe for the winter Wanted a higher shoe with added warmth for colder weather. With these the thick inner lining and the zipper enclosure provide just what I needed. And the Bounce technology is the most comfortable I've ever walked in! Will buy again in a low cut shoe for summer.,BDZ11
3,12/03/2017,"Comfortable but weird looking Theyre nice shoes but i walked in and my roommate said ""wow those are really nothing like ive ever seen before"" so take that as youd like",BDZ11
4,12/02/2017,"Legitimate running shoes These shoes are comfortable, however as others have mentioned they are a bit snug due to how the inner part works. If you are close to needing the next size in what you normally where definitely consider going up. I have done a couple of trail runs in theses. The grip is fantastic. The outer layer serves as a gaiter, helping to keep out debris. The convenience of just having to zip them up is great.",BDZ11
1,12/01/2017,Loved how they looked but size weird I loved how they looked and would love to wear them but the size length was was perfect but could not zip them up and had to return them unfortunately,BDZ11
5,11/27/2017,overall great although uncomfortable first when worn in is great,BDZ11
1,11/23/2017, sole is very hard like walking direct on concrete. I was expecting a soft sole when I saw the picture of the shoes on the website.,BDZ11
5,11/18/2017,Underpriced for what they are I got the size a half size too big and they’re perfect,BDZ11
2,11/17/2017,Almost perfect I ordered a sz 9.5 and when I tried them on it was a perfect fit except I couldn't zip up the zipper. I wouldn't recommend this shoe if you have wide feet.,BDZ11
2,11/17/2017,even that it was the same size but I couldn't put my feet in good quality but the size is not perfect and I post it back and received nothing from Adidas,BDZ11
4,11/07/2017,A quality purchase The product is a good running shoes and has a perfect fit.,BDZ11
5,11/05/2017,"Great shoes. The back heel/side ankle support cushion could be higher and should hug the ankles better. Sleek design, practical and comfortable. The shoes’ no-laces, zipper function with the instep band hugging your feet feels great and makes it easy to get in and out of.",BDZ11
3,11/03/2017, This shoe runs small because of the inner liner. Wish I would have known that when ordering,BDZ11
3,11/02/2017,"Under sole is to firm, none flexing I use this shoe for running and the under sole does not flex well. It seems although I'm running on top of a brick.",BDZ11
5,10/31/2017,"It's pretty cool shoes the width is little tight, not that easy to take on or take off",BDZ11
3,10/25/2017,"Lots of Potential This sneaker REALLY appealed to me in terms of aesthetics, and that traction looked phenomenal for winter. I know adidas in no way advertised them as water resistant or anything of the sort, but ""weather resistant"" makes it seem as if it would at least repel water slightly. The upper *absorbs* water so this unfortunately will not suit my winter needs. The length of the shoe is a bit long and the width is a bit narrow (compared to Ultraboosts in the same size). The traction in person was as aggressive as the pictures depict, and the Continental rubber compound only enhances that. I wouldn't recommend this for the winter, but would without a doubt recommend them for the fall.",BDZ11
5,10/24/2017,Great design Love the design and comfort of my new shoes! light weight and stylish!,BDZ11
5,10/22/2017,"One of my better purchases..... This shoe is very comfortable, sleek and stylish....light weight and durable!",BDZ11
4,10/21/2017," The flap under the zipper got caught in the zipper the first time I put them on and tore. Also they are very hot. Not good for summer, should be better for winter.",BDZ11
5,10/20/2017, Love these shoes!! I wear them to work and with suits now!!,BDZ11
1,10/19/2017, It has inner lining that's too hot and constricting,BDZ11
4,10/16/2017," Fits like a glove, I did not expect the way it molds to my feet.",BDZ11
3,10/11/2017,Have to unwillingly return These shoes are amazing but not made for a wider foot. I will try to exchange for a 10.5 but im sure I won't like the extra length.,BDZ11
3,10/11/2017,"Not water repellent After read the other reviews went half size up, fits perfect and overall pretty comfortable, saw its winterized with water repellent treatment, so I wore it on a rainy day, turn out the upper absorb water right away instead of keep them out. So if you are looking for something to handle rainy or snowy seasons, this one is not for you, still pretty good looking and comfortable shoe tho.",BDZ11
4,09/29/2017,"Nice looking and comfortable runner I bought this runner for comfort and looks. It's a great looking shoe with great colour combination, also I love the colour turquoise.",BDZ11
3,09/15/2017,GORGEOUS SHOES BUT TOO NARROW Had to unwillingly return the shoes as they were too tight. Sadly or happily had to select another style.,BDZ11
5,10/16/2017,True to size Shoe is true to size  .Light weight  shoe and comfortable,BDZ15
4,11/09/2017,Great looking and pretty comfortable. My feet are a little wide and the shoe is able to accommodate that. Great looking and pretty comfortable. My feet are a little wide and the shoe is able to accommodate that.,CDD21

1,09/20/2017,"AWFUL!!! Worst running shoes I have ever had. 
Such a disappointment. I am preparing for my 3rd half marathon and previously have been running in the ADIDAS ULTRABOOST that were amazing. Decided to change, like the design, got them and those shoes are not worth a penny! Cheap finish, sole comes off and they are just so uncomfortable and hard..it would be more comfortable tp tun in flip-flops than in those and much cheaper too!",CDD21
2,08/27/2017,"Quality of Adidas is going down! I have been buying Adidas the last 10 years and at least 1 pair a year. There will be no more Adidas for me. Looks nice, but very poor quality ""cheap feeling"" and far to small compared to the size I usually buy.
My gut feeling is that the quality has gone down on the running shoes every since the McCartney name came on. Must be paying more to her than to quality of the shoes...",CDD21
3,08/26/2017,"A cheaper alternative to purchasing the traditional Adidas Ultra Boost shoe I like nearly everything about these except that the tongue of this shoe tends to shift on me a lot no matter how tight I tie the laces. I find myself stopping to readjust it often during my intense 2 hour workouts. I've worn these for HIIT, kickboxing, cycling, Zumba and gym boot camps so far. I have narrow ankles, wide toe base and flat feet. Shoe provides great arch support. They do not collapse while wearing these. My feet stayed unusually cool due to the awesome ventilation design across top of toe box area. These breath so well and would be great in a hot area. Only suggestion is they should've designed a thicker shoe tongue Or made it not move like on my Adidas ultra Boost shoe. I don't regret buying these but glad I didn't pay full price. Choose ultra boost over these if you can only get one pair of shoes.",CDD21
5,08/26/2017,obsessed! Best shoes ever. extremely comfortable. cool design. I love them so much going to get another pair.,CDD21

Good on trail, just enough cushion on pavement for a lightweight like me. Conforms to foot from first lacing. Decent in rain, dries fast. In 100 degree heat a bit hot so I must wear 100% wool to prevent blisters...good solid shoe.",GII64
4,06/15/2017,"A good looking nice shoe These shoes are really nice. Purchased them mainly for bike riding/commuting because of the shoe tread. They are light and airy and look really good. I have always fit perfectly into size 9 Adidas shoes whether Performance or Originals, however, this particular shoe seems to fit a little on the small size which makes the fit a little awkward from what I'm usually used to. If I were the purchase another pair maybe I would try on a size 9.5 first.",GII64
5,06/15/2017,"Great grip and comfort for outdoors Good fit, easy cleaning when it has mud attached. Excellent grip",GII64
1,06/15/2017,"Junk I bought these for work, they are uncomfortable number 1, there is zero arch support. The heel has cone off already just from walking. I bought these wore them a few times and now they are junk. Waste of money.",GII64
5,06/14/2017,perfect I really liked the tennis. Comfortable and safe. Highly recommend!,GII64
4,06/04/2017, Great show. Great fit. Love going hiking in these every weekend,GII64
5,05/28/2017,I am very happy with my purchase. Adidas are one of my favorite brands. I like the product because is comfortable and the prices are reasonable. I like the colors and the styles.,GII64
4,05/21/2017,"A good shoe to buy with the size it build and the variety colors, I knew the Adidas for years since my childhood, and till now I love its durable quality, though the cost is little high but it worth to have one all the time.",GII64
4,05/08/2017,"great purchase lightweight, sturdy, and versatile enough for walking or running",GII64

5,04/23/2017,"Love this runner Perfect fit, comfortable and great support for forest trails",GII64
4,04/12/2017,"Great trail shoe but heavy Very comfortable stable shoe with fantastic traction and good cushioning. The outsole retains almost no dirt or stones which I love.

The only negative about the shoe is that my size 9 weighs in at 353 g which makes it the heaviest running shoe I own. However during training I did not notice the weight of the shoe in a negative way.",GII64
5,04/01/2017, Fits small. Had to order 1 size larger. Great shoe.,GII64
5,03/09/2017,"Awesome shoe, fits right, very comfortable. I'm pretty sure this shoe is meant to be the Kanadia TR's replacement. If that's the case, this shoe is an improvement over all the complaints I may have had of the Kanadia. This shoe fits true to what I feel is the typical Adidas fit. Its comfortable—it has cushion in just the right spots and doesn't have a hard sewn tongue. It also looks every bit as good as the Kanadia did.",GII64
5,02/05/2017,awesome the shoes wear like iron and are very comfortable. I would fully recommend them to everyone,GII64
5,12/01/2017, Love the look of them and they feel great! Would definitely purchase again when I need them.,KEJ77

1,11/25/2017,"Didn't survive the streets of NYC I initially purchased these shoes because I wanted a nice looking trail shoe, and yes, these look very nice. When I first tried them on, and when I first walked them through their initial week long break-in, they were the most comfortable shoes I had ever worn. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking if I only brought these shoes on my trip to NYC I'd be a happy camper. Sadly, I wore these shoes for 3 days straight walking extensively through NYC and surrounding areas, and found my feet and ankles extremely swollen, my heels rubbed raw, my toes blistered, and by the third day was ready to throw them into the Hudson River as I couldn't bear to take another step in these shoes. The flight back home was sans shoes while on the plane as just looking at these shoes made me cringe. I had very high hopes, but can't wear them anymore as the fear of feet and ankle alignments still haunts me.",KEJ77
4,11/20/2017, Very lightweight. It is half a size bigger on me but i can deal with it. The color is black and salmon pink. Looks sturdy and stylish. I have yet to try it on my hike as i've only tried it to my zumba class and my feet didn't hurt.,KEJ77
5,11/15/2017,My first Adidas. I finally found my running shoe.  I love the comfort and style.,KEJ77
4,11/05/2017," Only bad is the piping and wording is pink. I thought it was red. Overall great shoe, super fast shipping too! Now if only I could get the Lewis/Pillar worn at the Solheim, my world would be perfect!!",KEJ77
5,10/29/2017,Great selection and fast shipping. I am going to the smoky mountains in November. Wanted a pair of boots but decided to look at tennis shoes. Found the Adidas trail running shoes. Who needs boots when Adidas makes the perfect shoe.,KEJ77
5,10/27/2017,Best purchase ever! The shoe is so comfortable and perfect for running.,KEJ77
5,09/15/2017,"I tried adidas because of my son who is 10 and he loves it. I began liking it too. I find it very comfortable, stylish and affordable. This is an awesome shoe. I wished you had it in more colors.

5,07/22/2017, The support in this shoe has helped with knee problems while walking/running,KEJ77
5,07/03/2017,"Great comfort right out of the box! Rockadia's are the next gen of my favorite Kanadia's. The Rockadia shoes were a good size 7. They felt great right out of the box. My first run in them was over 2 miles. I did not experience any issues. I would buy them again. They have good grip, cushion, and comfort around the ankle.",KEJ77
5,06/29/2017,Quality It is comferteble for causal and i recommended for everyone,KEJ77
5,06/28/2017,A great and practical purchase Stylish and comfy. Great for running. An eye catcher.,KEJ77
5,06/27/2017,"Good Buy I use these for training and running. They are comfortable and supportive. The only complaint I have is how heavy they are. However, I guess it could be a good thing to quicken muscle tone. I would recommend.",KEJ77
4,06/23/2017,"Full support and true to size. I read other reviews prior to purchase as I was looking for an everyday shoe with exceptional comfort and support. Many said this shoe was perfect for that however, for me and my back issues I will have to work up to wearing a full day. First few full days was too much. I'm hoping for the best. 
 Shoe offers full support and true to size.",KEJ77
5,06/22/2017,"awesome shoe! Absolutely the best running show I've bought. Perfect fit, didn't have to break them in and they are beyond comfortable. Fit like a glove.",KEJ77
5,06/22/2017,"No regrets! An amazing athletic shoe! Bought these for hiking and the traction on these is perfect. Kind of like a hiking boot/running shoe hybrid, they're pretty great for just about anything.",KEJ77
5,06/21/2017," No break in period, I went on a four mile hike, the shoes felt great.",KEJ77
5,06/19/2017," Awesome shoes! I was actually looking for the Adidas Thrasher running shoes because I have owned a few pair for running and working out at the gym. They were my go-to athletic shoes. I guess Adidas doesn't make the Thrashers anymore and while looking into it I discovered the Rockadias. It turns out they are identical to the Thrasher with a different color scheme. I ordered them and when I received them I compared them to my old Thrashers. They are the same model and fit great. I'm super happy to find these. One thing I will mention when ordering these online is that the highlight color apppears to be red on a screen, but the actual color is not red. It's a neon salmon color, fyi. Still awesome shoes. I'm happy :)",KEJ77
5,06/16/2017, I'm on my feet all day and I need comfort. I have a previous back injury and I can't just wear any shoe. I've tried other's but my Addidas are the only way to go.,KEJ77
5,06/16/2017,"A sturdy, stable shoe These are my favorite shoes and when ADIDAS takes breaks from making them, I fall into deep depression. 

Okay not really, but here's why I think they're great. I overpronate and have PFS in both knees, so I wear orthotics and choose my shoes carefully. The extra grip of these shoes is perfect for giving me added stability where my knees lack it. The curved front is great for helping me flex my ankle more fully and for staying on the balls of my feet more, also helpful on the knee problems. I have proportionally narrower heels, and it's incredibly comfortable and well-fitting tkchave the backs come up higher- no blisters or chafing like some shoes. They are not the lightest weight shoe out there, but they are firm and sturdy and make me feel sure of every step- trail, sidewalk, or treadmill. They also last a ridiculously long time, despite my attempts to destroy pairs that are too old for running in sports, camping, and other activities.",KEJ77
5,06/16/2017,"Great! Great quality, sturdy, doesn't pinch, a shoe that seems like it will last more than 1 season (they are hard to find)!",KEJ77

To me they worked for different kind of exercise. comfortable.",KEJ77
5,04/28/2017,"Great trail running shoe I read a review that said to order a half size up --I did, and they were too big. Sold them to a friend and bought my usual size and they fit like a glove. Great for trail running, especially in the muddy spring. Going downhill is no problem --great grip.",KEJ77

4,11/29/2017,"Cool Perfect style, just that it’s bit narrow so I keep scratching my heels against the inner heels of shoes.",CDA71
5,11/22/2017,Very Comfortable At first I was drawn to these shoes because of the metallic accents. The understated sparkle alluring but they were unusual and I didn't know if I could pull them off. These are very comfortable and warm. I just wish they were more waterproof. Many compliments received. Now to try the all terrain boost :),CDA71
4,11/13/2017,"Super luxe sneakers I am a month or so into actually using these shoes for running. They're very comfortable and super well cushioned. I have to say that so far, since using these instead of my usual Ultraboost STs, I am getting some mild shin splints. I don't know if it's only the fault of the shoes or if I just require a more supportive pair of running shoes. In any case, they're super pretty and unique so even if I stop running in them, they're great for wearing on the street.",CDA71
5,10/22/2017,Very well designed These are perfect for my foot. I like barefoot running but now find I need the support that these shoes offer.,CDA71
3,10/02/2017,"Not as happy as I was with my first pair. LOVE the look, it's my second pair of Stellas but after awhile they hurt the top of my feet :(",CDA71
5,09/10/2017,"Style and comfort! These shoes are so comfortable and they look great. There was a time when if you wanted super comfortable shoes, they were going to be awful looking but adidas never lets me down. The prime knit works for a lot of foot problems. Wide width, sore anything, prime kit is the perfect choice.",CDA71
5,08/30/2017,"best purchase ever comfortable with good quality, great design with reasonable price",CDA71
5,08/25/2017,"Simply amazing! I just love Ultra Boots Uncaged. I wont 4 pairs. When I saw theses I was hoping they will be as comfortable as above. I was right!

5,10/20/2017,Son delighted with these Bought these for my son and he is very happy with them. Originally bought his normal size but had to return as they were too small so would recommend buying a size up. They are very comfortable and the pattern is good as it doesn’t get dirty. A great buy.,CDE59
5,10/19/2017,You won’t regret buying these shoes Pricy but really worth investing as it is the most comfortable shoe I own.,CDE59

5,07/28/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned I have owned CS2s, NMDs, and inikis. Ultraboosts are hands down the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I don't know if this is something common with the ultraboosts but there are little pieces that look like they're missing from the boost material. I know with the boost material on my other shoes theyre pretty smooth. That was just something I noticed. Also the colors are way more vivid in person.",CDE59
5,07/27/2017,One of the best colorway released this year Same ultraboost comfort new colorway. Sizing a bit off. If you wear size 4 on yeezy v2 go half size up on this one just my opinion based on my girlfriend's sizing.,CDE59
5,07/27/2017,Great purchase! One of the best shoe ever made. Quality and comfort is excellent. Will definitely recommend it...,CDE59

5,09/17/2017,"Prince Charming, you found my shoe! This shoe fits perfect! It fits great at the ankle, just like a sock. The sole is great for arch support and is very comfortable.

I would totally buy these again, thanks Adidas! :)",CDE64

5,08/18/2017,"Sooo comfortable I've been wanting to get a pair of ultra boost and the store in SF finally had my size in kids (6Y). Fell in love right away. it's my first ""sock-like"" material so i was bit unsure if it would get too tight/uncomfortable for prolonged wear but these bad boys helped me through the many long walks I did in Europe during my honeymoon. i even tested it for a run at the airport as we were trying to catch our flight haha. Overall I love it so much i am buying another pair.",CDE64
5,07/24/2017,Comfortable and might be on the pricy side but it's worth it. Great shoe. Comfortable and worth it for the pricing.,CDE64

4,06/20/2017,"Good show for walking Likes: protects heel of foot from impact with the ground while walking, breathable material, matches with almost all clothes. Dislike: not water proof, the hard piece that holds the shoe laces can rub/press on the top of the foot leaving irritation/mark/bruise.",CDE64
5,06/19/2017,They're fantastic. My grandson smiled from ear to ear when he got these sneakers. Says they are not only extremely stylish but incredible comfortable as well.,CDE64

5,11/05/2017,Worth buying Bought for my wife perfect fit and excellent for running and walking,CDC30
5,11/04/2017,Best running show I’ve had! I love these pair of shoes! I am usually either an 8.5 or an 8. I ordered an 8.5 and the fit was perfect! So if you’re usually in between two different sizes... I would choose the larger one you can fit into. Also the sole of this shoe must have like heightened spots on the bottom for optimum running potential. But this shoe is defiantly a running/jogging/leisure shoe. Do NOT try and lift weight/do lunges with them. I tried doing lunges and my feet kept slipping on the floor. I would recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a new running shoe!,CDC30
4,10/26/2017,"Love these shoes! I've only recently started taking my running a bit more serious and going to the gym more so i thought it's time I invested in some proper trainers. I looked about for ages, all different brands, and then tried loads of the Boost trainers on in store and chose these. 
Love the colour of them, they look so cool on, but in terms of comfort they are great. I love the inner sole on these, I've got a pretty high arch and these shoes suit so well. They aren't as spongey at the front of the shoe, but i think I'm just getting used to them. 
I did have to go up a size in these. with all the ones i tried on, the styles with the gap underneath the arch have a bit less give i think.",CDC30
5,10/25/2017,"Worth every penny! I love my Pure Boosts anyway, x-terrain is perfect for winter and have been comfortable from the start.  Good grip in wet weather and good for muddy tracks. Would definitely buy again.",CDC30
3,10/17/2017,"Not For Me I was looking for a solid running shoe and after reading many reviews, I decided to buy a pair, but when I tried them on, I didn’t like the way they fit. I am currently enjoying the Pureboost Xpose running shoes more than these as a running shoe. They went back to the store.",CDC30
5,10/08/2017,"Very fashionable, comfortable and very resilient in the rain Very fashionable, comfortable and very resilient in the rain",CDC30
4,10/06/2017,Very nice shoes Awesome shoes. Very comfortable. They come a tiny bit bigger. I got a size 8. But I actually liked how I had a little more room. It's not like they made your feet look big/awkward. Very nice shoes!,CDC30
5,09/25/2017,"Lightweight yet supportive, good lookin' shoes I haven't given the shoes the test of time, but so far I am so happy. Super light weight and feels so bouncy and supportive.",CDC30
5,09/22/2017,Loveee them!!!! Photos do no justice Absolutely love my purchase! The photos do absolutely no justice.,CDC30
4,10/20/2017,"super comfy, but 1/2 size small bought to replace runners.
i'm usually a 7.5 in adidas, so bought a 7.5, but thought it was a smidgen too short. because of the techfit upper, my big toe sort of stuck up through the fabric despite having 1/2 inch to an inch of room, which felt weird. i'm returning them and ordering an 8 because i really want these to work. the overall fit is nice and snug, which i think takes some getting used to if you wear more traditional sneaks. 
can't say what they feel like running until i receive the 8s, but they feel light and supportive. 
can't wait!",CDC31
4,10/02/2017,Awesome buy Its really efficient. Lasts long and very comfy shoes.,CDC31

5,11/18/2017,"Cool, comfortable and for a good cause! Love these Parley Ultra Boost, glad I got them for an incredible price. Though size is a little tight (it’s a half size too small), these Ultra Boost are still ultra comfortable!",CDI86
4,11/17/2017,"Very comfy only that it's tighter than regular uncaged boost. I own both women size 6 regular uncaged, and the men size 5 parley uncaged. Lengths of the two pairs are almost the same. However, the parley is much tighter, I think this is because they are using a different material for the upper.",CDI86
5,10/28/2017,"Snug fit that needs breaking in period Great on runs and as fashionable like my NMD's. Wore this on my flight back from Portland to LA for a 2.5 hour flight. Due to it being new, the Mid foot was a bit tight and you feel it after seating for that long. Parley uncaged needs break in period. I only felt that tightness after seating that long, but when I started walking again tightness to my midfoot disappears. 
The boost is excellent. I have NMD R1, R2 and Pureboost DPR.  The Parley is definitely a running and lifestyle shoe.  The boost on the Parley felt the more bouncy than my other boost - keeping you in full comfort both running and walking.  
It is lifestyle as well as you have so many options to lace this. I wanted 3 (adidas) lace to stand out and I was able to do it with lacing. 
I have wide feet 9.5, and I got 9.5 and it is true to fit. Get a half size larger (for wide feet) if you plan more on just walking around this and you love your wiggle room for your toes.  Having wore this for 8 hours, with 2 straight hours of standing - this by far the most comfortable Adidas boost.",CDI86
4,10/25/2017,Great buy! I don't like the fact that the lowest layer of the shoe is white. It gets dirty quickly.,CDI86
4,10/20/2017,Cool but fitted Love the look of this shoe. Pretty narrow last combined with the knit makes it fitted. Suggest sizing up 1 or even 1.5 if you don't like a snug toe box. The size 11 in these are the same length as the size 10 in the Pureboost.,CDI86
5,10/08/2017, overall great fit and very comfortable. great pick up for your everyday shoe,CDI86
4,10/06/2017,"Huge Fan of Uncaged's Uncaged's are my favourite shoe I own, although the Parley's do fit a bit tighter than my other ones. Still a great purchase!!",CDI86

5,09/09/2017, This is a great shoe.  Very comfortable.  Highly recommend it!,CDI86
5,08/31/2017,"Best shoe 2017 super comfy and sleek. The boost is great and shoe is snug. My right root is slightly wider so the right shoe is a bit tight at first, but after a while its all good.",CDI86
5,08/31/2017,"best purchase ever ultimate comfort, will be buying additional pairs!!",CDI86
5,08/22/2017,Beautiful Looks and feels great! Distinctive adidas style and comfortable boost sole. Definitely prefe the uncaged vs caged for running.,CDI86
5,08/18/2017,Comfortable and stylish shoes are the quintessence of parleys. I find the comfortability impressive tremendous purchase that I have no regret about.,CDI86
4,08/14/2017,"Nice shoe more show than go Great shoe but durability is the question, so do not expect to do nothing more than being able to run and maybe do a few lifts like deadlift and squats, not really that durable for a lot of cardio related stuff. Not ladder drills. So from a gym point of view deadlifts and squats are a go, but avoid dynamic stuff (high knees etc.) or stitchings will begin to separate from the shoe quite quickly.",CDI86
5,08/13/2017,Walking on pillows Love the look and feel of these shoes. I will order a second pair soon.,CDI86
5,08/11/2017,"cant go wrong with this shoes superb, it feels comfortable in my feet and suitable to wear for long distance walking",CDI86
4,07/27/2017, Looking good on feet with comfy and beautiful colour.,CDI86
4,07/27/2017,"Fluff, not stuff Decent shoe, good looking, extremely narrow and too much toe pitch, so much that the insert is bowed and doesn't lay flat until your foot is in the shoe.",CDI86
5,07/27/2017,"Perfect but with a slight flaw A bit tight in the middle making it difficult to wear, but otherwise perfectly comfortable.",CDI86
5,07/26/2017,"right color and comfort the color and design is unique, and i love how comfortable it is, enabling me to walk for hours",CDI86
4,07/21/2017,"Beautiful shoe! The style and quality are superior. The ""sock-like cuffs"" take a little getting used to and require socks that cover the ankle to protect your skin from rubbing.",CDI86
5,07/21/2017,Plastic Shoes for the Better Feels like heaven like all other BOOOST shoes. The shoes are holding up with all the abusive I have beaten into them,CDI86
4,07/20/2017," Great quality, beautiful shoe. Just comes half a size too small.",CDI86
5,07/19/2017,"Quality Product With A Quality Story Behind It!! The Parley Ultraboosts are a fantastic shoe. Along with the outstanding comfort that we have come to expect in an Ultraboost, the parley gives you a feeling that you have helped the planet. Each pair is woven from 11 plastic bottles fished out from the sea, and delivered to your door. Great collaboration from Adidas and Parley, I could not be happier to be team three stripes!! #HeretoCreate",CDI86
5,07/16/2017,"Amazing, can't believe I got them retail Super comfy and look so dope! It's also awesome that they are made with ocean plastic!",CDI86
2,07/13/2017, It's to very fit but i love this boost. It's very cool,CDI86
4,07/12/2017,"Good shoes but could fit better Size is too small, get at least half size up. Not very suitable for actual running.",CDI86
5,07/09/2017, I got the Parleys because they were the color that I wanted. Parleys are more expensive because of the materials used. They're very comfortable to use and people always notice them.,CDI86
5,07/07/2017,it is a good i liked it because it was the best shoe I ever had and it is really comfortable.,CDI86
4,07/07/2017, As most reviewers suggested go a size up. I didn't listen and got my usual size but had to return it. Love the parely collection.,CDI86
2,07/07/2017,Sizes are erratic. My previous identical pair was size 11 from Adidas.com. This pair was also size 11 but was way to small so they were returned.  I ended up buying them from a local retailer.,CDI86
4,07/06/2017,Runs at least half a size too small Product looks amazing but order half a size up at least,CDI86
5,07/04/2017,"The most comfortable shoes I've worn Very comfortable. light weight, stylish, good design",CDI86
4,07/02/2017,Too Small I have a pair of Ultra Boost Uncaged shoes already so I ordered the same size. But these were much smaller - at least a half size or maybe a full size smaller. I liked the look blue color and the fact that recycled plastic was used in their manufacturing. Just didn't fit.,CDI86
3,07/01/2017,"Great shoe and action comfort...but re-think the built in sock design ""sock"" (built in ankle sock) is too tight and makes it difficult to put on and take off. If you are not always active (walking or running), the shoe gets very uncomfortable with the choking sock.",CDI86
5,06/30/2017,GREAT SHOE!! Great product one of best shoes adidas has came out with!,CDI86
1,06/30/2017,Regret Got a one too small seems like only a half size smaller than what I need but they already started hurted the back of my foot. The sick part and hardish part at the back of the shoe where they meet scraped my foot and cut it a bit. Not satisfied and these shoes were expensive and hard to replace when they are gone in a day on here.,CDI86
5,06/28/2017,Best design It's really comfortable and lightweight. The ultraboost sole is technically great and supported,CDI86
4,06/28/2017,"Great color, runs small Runs smaller than other ultra boost uncaged, quality of materials very similar, but some of the detail around the toe is not as good as regular ultra boost uncaged. Color looks even better in person",CDI86
5,06/26/2017,The best quality out there I like the boost it is the most comfortable shoes.,CDI86
5,06/25/2017,KUDOS TO PARLEY X ADIDAS! THE SHOES ARE DOPE. THE CAUSE IS REAL. These feel much better to me than the normal primeknit material - not quite as stretchy and more durable. If you make a quick cut it doesnt feel like your foot is going to bust through the upper like the normal primeknits do. ALSO - PARLEY IS AWESOME AND KUDOS TO ADIDAS FOR SUPPORTING THEIR CAUSE.,CDI86
5,06/24/2017,Instantly made it to the top of the rotation They look better on feet then they do in the picture very comfy I'm almost true to size it is really tight at first but it does stretch out. Afterwords it is just as comfy as a regular uncaged ultra boost,CDI86
5,06/24/2017,Parley!!... Turning a problem into an awesome product Super comfortable.. fits like a glove ... i love the fact it's made from reclaimed ocean plastic,CDI86
1,06/23/2017,I wouldn't recommend trying to buy without first trying on a pair to know the correct size Very difficult to get the right fit online without trying the shoe online.,CDI86
5,06/23/2017,"Looks good, feels good. Great shoes This product is so comfortable! It's like wearing socks not to mention how bouncy the sole is. They were my first pair of ultraboost shoes and the colour is absolutely beautiful. It's also great to know that the collaboration between adidas and parley means that some the product uses some ocean plastic in the knit in the shoe. Amazing shoes.",CDI86
5,06/22/2017,"It's Like Walking On Clouds!!! Feels like I am walking on clouds. Super comfortable. Very good stretch to them. A little expensive in my opinion. Should be 60.00 cheaper, but very good shoe.",CDI86
5,06/22/2017,"Love everything about these. Love the styling and minimal branding. Love the sock-style design, love the breathability of the material. Overall A+++. I might buy another pair as a backup!",CDI86
3,06/21/2017,"TRUE TO SIZE Website says runs half size small, so I did just that. Arrived and were too small, but my size was sold out. Checked today and they have them back in.. smh. Now I'm wearing uncomfortable shoes until I can afford another pair.",CDI86
3,06/19/2017,"Okay purchase, will only buy caged version Boost is amazing, but the built in sock on top rubs on the back of my foot and leaves a rash.",CDI86
5,06/18/2017,Comfortable shoe and great colour Shoe is comfortable and comes in a great shade of blue.,CDI86
5,06/17/2017, Good looking shoe and comfy fit. Lots of arch support.,CDI86
5,06/16/2017, I recommend this product. This modle is comfortable. The material is good.,CDI86
1,06/15/2017,Sent me a defected shoe Sent me a defected shoe. Not what I expected from a $200 shoe,CDI86
4,06/15/2017, Great style and comfort. It's a tight fitting and I can only wear a thin sock.,CDI86
5,06/14/2017, I like this product because it is made out of recycled water bottles. Great for the environment!,CDI86
5,06/14/2017, Great pair of ultra boost uncaged. Love the back of the shoe it's just too nice!,CDI86
3,06/13/2017, runs small. But perfect apart form that. Ultraboost is ultraboost!,CDI86
5,06/13/2017,Comfortable as ever This is the most comfortable pair of shoe I've ever worn.,CDI86
5,06/11/2017," Really good, as expected. However go 0.5 size up for a better fit. Great product in general love the idea!",CDI86
5,06/09/2017,Good product I like the product a lot but I think by now Adidas should have dropped the price since it's been available for so long.,CDI86
4,06/09/2017,"Very happy with my purchase. This is a very light shoe with an awesome colour. I can hardly tell I'm wearing them. They do run slightly small (my usual size was okay lengthwise, but too tight - feet would be numb after an hour of wearing them, due to poor circulation), so I'd recommend 1/2 a size bigger than usual. The difference might not be that noticeable when it comes to length, but it will be regarding the tightness of the shoe. They do adjust to your foot in time - I think the material stretches slightly, but no so much that they would be too big all of a sudden. When running in them, they give you a bit of a spring. They are also great for longer walks. I would definitely recommend this shoe.",CDI86
4,06/09/2017,"Size up. Really nice looking - probably the best colour I've seen for the Ultra Boost Uncaged 3.0. Unfortunately the sizing is off on this one - you'll need to size up a half size or even possibly a full size (especially if you have wide feet). I normally wear size 8, but ordered a 9 just in case, and I am glad I did as I don't think even the 8.5 would've been comfortable. If you can, try before you buy.",CDI86
2,06/07/2017,"Too tight I stayed true to my size, but these are too tight. I have the black uncage ltd ultra boost and they are fine. I guess i should have sized up. They look great but, wished they felt as great.",CDI86
4,06/07/2017,High quality materials and design. Another amazing product by Adidas! See for yourself.,CDI86
3,06/05/2017,This shoe is more narrow and tight compared to other ultraboosts This shoe is too narrow and tight. Other ultraboosts arent that tight at the same size so buy up by a lot,CDI86
4,06/03/2017,Really good shoe Great shoe and great colour scheme. Size 9 feels slightly narrow compared to a size 8.5 of the brown uncaged but not uncomfortable,CDI86
5,06/03/2017," Adidas Ultra Boost it's where I stopped in searching the perfect shoes for my runs even though they might not be comfortable for few times ( as it was for me with my first ultra boost pair ) until your feet will get used with these tight fit like a sock kinda shoes. I selected comfort Ok because they're perfect for your runs but if you'll buy'em thinking they'll be awesome for your daily casual day by day wear you'll be wrong and I would sugest to go for Adidas Pure Boost in that case since they're more loose and therefore more comfortable for big amount of time wear.
I hope my review will be helpful for y'all ADIDAS fans like me out there & happy runnings. ;)",CDI86
5,06/03/2017,I'm glad I both them. I feel comfortable and great. I wish there was something to hold when I wear them.,CDI86

5,06/01/2017,"Great shoes, great color My first pairs of ultras, and I love them. wish I would have gotten 12 instead of 11 1/2 though. Absolutely beautiful and clean pair of kicks. Has made me a customer for life.",CDI86
5,05/31/2017,"Great shoes with a unique style! Probably half a size  small compared to other UltraBoost but with a thin sock they are fine.
Love the save the ocean message with the Parley colab and look forward to future Parley products.",CDI86
4,05/31/2017,Awesome but let's try to get standard sizes. Smaller than other colors of the same shoe in the same size.,CDI86
5,05/30/2017,"I bought the shoes, because it helps the investment. This is the first time I have bought ultra boos and it's the most comfortable shoes I have own.",CDI86
4,05/30/2017,Excellent ltd sneakers Great sneakers. Buy a whole size bigger and accept the knit isn't as flexible as normal uncaged,CDI86
5,05/30/2017,Make more shoes with recycled plastics! The future of shoes. Nice for running and leisure.,CDI86
5,05/30/2017,Incredible purchase for trendy freshness Ultraboost Uncaged Parley Sneaker Review from Initial Launch,CDI86

5,05/29/2017, Super comfortable. My second pair of ultraboost uncaged. Love these shoes.,CDI86
5,05/29/2017,very nice shoe great shoe but a bit less width then some other i find but still amazing,CDI86
4,05/29/2017,"Love the shoe but traditional uncaged are better. Great shoe, looks great. The heel is stiff though and hard to put on and adjust.",CDI86
5,05/29/2017,"Favorite collaboration ever. I love the ultra boost on its own, this parley rendition just runs small. go half size up and you'll be fine! I bought for the concept, the parley collaboration is amazing.",CDI86
5,05/28/2017," It feels amazing! Best shoe I ever bought hands down! It wraps around my feet for the perfect fit, Everyone should grab at least one pair of these bad boys.",CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Best shoe I've bought in the last year for sure. So close to perfection while you run;light weight but you feel the strength of the technology used to make this shoe;almost as good as the adistar you guys stopped making.My favorite running shoe after the adistar.,CDI86
5,05/28/2017," Easy to match clothes. But the first time when I wear this one, it is not very smooth to put it on.",CDI86
2,05/28/2017,"Very narrow shoe This show looks great and the cushioning is awesome. Big issue with the width since my last toe on both sides aren't fully supported by the cushioning. The upper allows them to be comfortable, but there is no support under them so I feel like I'm walking on the edge of a path. I would not recommend these unless you have very narrow feet.",CDI86
5,05/28/2017,"Excellent and comfortable shoes Very comfortable, fit perfectly. The most comfortable shoes for running. Too bad adidas won't have the fully black available at all times",CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Fantastic shoes and great colorway First pair of UB's. Incredibly comfortable but I wear a size 10.5 and bought an 11 and they are still pretty snug. I recommend at least a 1/2 size up.,CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Almost awesome shoe This shoe is awesome and I have many other UltraBoost.  The design is a little boring so I returned it.,CDI86
4,05/28/2017," Takes some getting used to on the fit, as it is very snug",CDI86
5,05/28/2017,One of the best colorway Great kicks super comfort been a fan of this style since day one,CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Worth it The fact it's made out of recycled ocean waste and they're this comfy. Amazing product!,CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Like walking on clouds Super comfortable and boost is great. The knit fabric feels like wearing a sock vs a shoe.,CDI86
4,05/28/2017,Solid pickup. The shoe is lightweight and fashionable. It's also a cool concept and good cause.,CDI86
5,05/28/2017," It fits great. Also quite eye catching.
As a running shoe it is very comfortable and does a better job than barefoot shoes to remind me to run correctly.",CDI86
4,05/28/2017," I like these because they look cool, and they are comfortable but they are a little tight on my feet and hard to wear.",CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Best purchase ever The perfect shoes I like the colour how they fit...,CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Worth it! Great product. Love the collab with Parley and recommend to people that want to buy it.,CDI86
5,05/28/2017,Most comfortable shoe Would recommend going half a size up personally great product,CDI86
5,05/27/2017," Sustainable, ultra boost and limited edition. What else is there to say?",CDI86
4,05/27/2017," Quite stiffer than the regular uncaged, which makes them not as comfortable. Still great, however and would definitely recommend. May need to go up a size because of their stiffness - I did.",CDI86
5,05/27/2017," Best running shoes ever. Very comfortable, fit perfectly.",CDI86
4,05/27/2017,First Ultra Boost Slightly tight at the ankle seam although the length fits nicely. Overall still a nice pair of ultra boost.,CDI86
5,05/27/2017,Great purchase. Very comfortable. Perfect for the gym or daily wear.,CDI86
2,05/26/2017,Fit not comfortable The shoe fits a half size smaller than stated on the label so I had to resort to ultra thin socks for the adjustment. Unfortunately the tips of the shoe put pressure on my big toe causing discomfort. Also the fitted entry was blistering my heel. Sadly I cannot use them so I'm returning.,CDI86
5,05/26/2017,Very comfortable Very comfortable shoe. Sleek design. Stable fit when training,CDI86
4,05/26/2017,"Comfy, would recommend half a size up. Very comfortable trainer like all ultra boosts, well made but would say go half a size up.",CDI86

4,05/25/2017,Very happy with my purchase. Awesome shoes and extremely comfortable! My only small complaint is that if you don't wear longer socks the back of the shoe will scratch the back of your foot bad. Although I'm sure that will go away after I wear them more.,CDI86
5,05/25/2017,My current favorite. Looks terrific sockless. Cushioning is fantastic. Contributes to saving the oceans.,CDI86
5,05/24/2017,"Best shoes ever! This is non other than the best shoes ever made. is not as comfortable as I thought but not because Adidas mistake, but because it is a Boost we have to ask for one size more, nevertheless it is difficult to put on but when I have them organized and comfortable in my feet is amazing!",CDI86
5,05/24/2017,Worth $260 It's more Visually appealing when Uncaged tbh.....,CDI86
5,05/24/2017, The most comfortable shoes I've ever worn in my life. They look incredible and help clean the ocean as well.,CDI86
5,05/24/2017,"You need a pair of uncaged, if your trying to complete your collection. This ultra boost is one of the most comfortable models hands down.",CDI86
4,05/23/2017,"Great buy Exceedingly comfortable, with sock like fit and tailored for running, yet great for casual wear. I've read reviews, but until you've worn and used these with purpose, it truly doesn't do these shoes justice. On a side note, fit is a tad bit narrow but not a deal breaker.",CDI86
5,05/23/2017,"Amazing purchase! Love these sneakers! Super comfortable and they are gorgeous! Also, they support a good cause. Have gotten a lot of compliments of them.",CDI86

5,05/23/2017,"Good deal The pair are really comfortable and soft, would recommend them",CDI86
4,05/22/2017,"Interesting, but complicated to find best fit Impractical but looks good.  It's also less stretchy/flexible than its non-parley counterparts.  
***It also runs half a size smaller.

I ended up returning mine, but in large part because I did not read that they ran extr small.  Needless to say I was rushing to buy them even though these didn't sell out as fast as the UB Parley.",CDI86
5,05/22/2017,"Enjoying every moment wearing it Feels like walking on cloud, very soft and light on feet",CDI86
4,05/22/2017,"Good but too snug The shoes are super comfy but they fit too small, I needed to go a full size up, still a really good shoe tho",CDI86
1,05/22/2017,"I wouldn't recommend these as a day to day pair of shoes, it's not at all breathable so they make your feet sweat constantly The design is way too narrow if you have normal feet",CDI86
5,05/22/2017, great product and great concept it just runs a little small.,CDI86

4,05/22/2017,"Best thing I ever have The size is not the same as the other one,but it's perfect",CDI86
4,05/22/2017,Ultra boosts are very comfortable but overpriced. Over priced and no free shipping even when over $200.,CDI86
4,05/22/2017, It feels uncomfortable on the top part of the feet and hurts a bit when you walk.,CDI86
1,05/22/2017,"Great idea but they have to be more consistent in production. It wasn't anything like my other uncaged Ultraboost. The toe bent up way too much and I had to force my foot in, I returned the shoe even though I've been wanting it forever!",CDI86
2,05/22/2017, The parley uncaged did not fit the same as the regular uncaged in the same size. Not as soft either...very disappointed,CDI86
5,05/22/2017,The concept is awesome! It fit like a glove. I have narrow feet and I love the fit! ... The only thing is the arch. I have to use my own inserts.,CDI86

5,05/21/2017,"Great addition to the collection Parley for the win, the shoe is very comfortable as any ultraboost. The concept behind the shoe is awesome, my only complaint is that they fit smaller than ultraboost 3.0, more like 2.0, so I had to take the insole out otherwise was to snug for me. Adidas I love  you but get your sizing right for once!!!",CDI86
5,05/21/2017,"Great shoe and great cause. Very comfortable, excellent colorway, first pair of uncaged and I am very happy.",CDI86

5,05/21/2017, I have a pair of NMD's and these felt almost the same even better.,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,First pair of uncaged and I'm not disappointed I wish the bottom sole was black just for the new look.,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,"One of my favorite purchases of the year so far! The Uncaged Parley UltraBoost is without a doubt a slept on shoe, it is beautiful in design and as always with UltraBoost models extremely comfortable! If your size is still available I would definitely cop!",CDI86
4,05/21/2017,"Best Recycled Shoe Little tighter than regular ultra boost, I'm sure it will break in.",CDI86
4,05/21/2017,"Comfy shoe, looks nice, too small The Boost sole is great and comfy, however I hate the practice of shoes that run small (which this shoe does). If it's known that a shoe is a half-size (or any size for that matter) small, the sizes for the shoe should be shifted instead of putting the burden on the consumer to get the right size.",CDI86
3,05/21/2017,"Try on a bigger size! The shoe feels a little too tight, and didn't quite look like the photo",CDI86
4,05/21/2017,Good experience and i am satisfied with my purchase. For my 1st lair of uncaged the shoe kinda digs into the back of my ankle but i think once it loosens up it should fit fine. Appearance and for the most part it is comfortable.,CDI86
4,05/21/2017, color of the shoe and cause is important.  Shoe was too small and needed to go up a full size,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,Shoe is aesthetically pleasing and extremely comfortably Adidas Ultra boosts represents Quality and comfort,CDI86
4,05/21/2017,"Outstanding, just a real tight fit. I would definitely recommend this shoe. Besides running small, they're outstanding.",CDI86
4,05/21/2017,Need a half size larger than normal uncaged. These are tighter than same size ultraboost uncaged.,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,Most comfortable shoes I've had in a while These shoes are great. Really comfortable and well worth the price,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,There just a little to much for a pair of shoes There great shoes just think that the other colors are better looking and cheaper,CDI86
4,05/21/2017,Fine They run a size small but are super nice. Wish I ordered bigger,CDI86
1,05/21/2017,"Not happy great looking shoes, but as a person who has worn Adidas his entire life, i am very dissapointed with this product. I ordered the right size but after wearing it once my ankle is swollen. I tried removing the soles but it didn't work either. They are extremely tight and uncomfortable. I cannot return it since I threw the box away, cause I though it's adidas and I will never have any problems with it.",CDI86
5,05/21/2017,such a flex great pair of trainers that would be great for summer,CDI86
5,05/21/2017,Boost is life Comfortable. Should give it a try. Will not regret it for sure.,CDI86
3,05/20/2017,I love boost but this one didn't work out well for me I am a woman and I bought men's size 6. Very comfortable but the ankle was way too tight . It cut of the circulation.,CDI86
5,05/20/2017,"Awesome! Fits well and very comfortable
Fits very well and very comfortable",CDI86
4,05/20/2017," nice color, comfortable, good for the environment.",CDI86
4,05/20/2017,"A little too tight for my wide feet. These look so clean, but I went with half a size up and they still squeeze my toes a lot. Not sure if this is something I can get used to, should've gone a whole size up.",CDI86
2,05/20/2017,"run very small I really loved these shoes until I tried to put them on, I ordered my normal ultra boost size which all fit perfectly but these were very small and tight I even tried them without the insole but they were still too small, I would like to return for a bigger size but they are all sold out.",CDI86
5,05/20/2017,Very happy with them This shoe is really comfortable as are all of the Ultraboost Uncaged. Very nice colour and clean design.,CDI86
5,05/20/2017," absolute beauty and really comfy, best boost purchased",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Super comfortable Great product - super comfortable. The shoes are slightly tighter than anticipated so go for half a size larger than you would normally.,CDI86
5,05/19/2017," I love this collection so much, the size is fit for me and so comfy!",CDI86
5,05/19/2017," very nice shoe, very comfortable and looks very nice.",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,"Amazing The colour is amazing, defo buying it again for my brother for present next time!",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Excellent Always like the ultra boost as they are the most comfortable trainers out there,CDI86
1,05/19/2017,Too Snug I have over 20 pairs of Ultra Boost in both caged and uncaged. This round of Parley's are uncomfortably tight. I had to return the caged and uncaged I secured on release day. Very disappointed that I was hyped on this project and the shoes are nothing like my other 3.0's or Uncaged's. Can Adidas confirm the disconnect in this model? Will they stretch out or is it because of the recycled ocean plastics the fit is different?,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Worth the price tag. Most comfortable shoes in my collection because of the ultraboost technology.Always a big fan of the boost. Recommend to go 0.5 size up.,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,"So comfy The parley edition, food to see use of plastic found in ocean",CDI86
4,05/19/2017,"Great initiative, great (lifestyle) shoe! This was my first experience with Ultra Boosts, and after having read countless reviews, I have to say they were a little less comfortable than I imagined (probably due to ridiculously high expectations I had) but still very comfortable nonetheless. I am still suffering from a chronic knee injury which has prevented me from running for a long time, and I was hoping these would be the shoes that I would use to slowly ease back in. I think the uncaged style makes them more of a lifestyle shoe than a running shoe, and my toes feel like they might pop out from the front.
The sizing is definitely off - I wear a UK5.5 for Stan Smiths and they fit perfectly. I went a half-size up and they are quite tight, but I'm sure they will stretch out a little after a couple of wears. I also have a relatively high arc which makes these shoes a little difficult to put on, even with the laces loose.
I do, however, LOVE the initiative behind these shoes - I think Adidas should definitely produce more sustainable products and make them the norm, rather than special releases.",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Clean shoe great design and concept Great shoe would recommend going up half a size in this,CDI86
4,05/19/2017,They are a little more snug than primeknit uppers. Design I feel is better. They look good on the feet. Very comfortable to run in.,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Probably one of the best looking Ultra Boost in my opinion. The shoe looks even better in person. Really good build quality and design,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,"Great shoes but needed to be 1/2 size larger. Fit is smaller/narrower than my other uncaged shoes; however, I am still happy with the shoes.",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,"Boost is life Boost are the comfiest shoes around, make no mistake, if you've never owned a pair then get to know",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,The Best. These shoes fit like a dream! I would strongly recommend them to anyone who wants some shoes which are comfortable and fitting.,CDI86
4,05/19/2017,"Good purchase Good running shoe, In the future I would potentially go for this shoe again",CDI86
2,05/19/2017," Looks Amazing. However, it's width runs half size too samll.",CDI86
5,05/18/2017,"it is very easy to pick up when i purchased from adidas.uk, very good experience. i love it so much because of Parley, the colour is perfect and unique, and the method of purchasing is fair, thank you adidas UK.",CDI86
5,05/18/2017,Great training runner excellent product Excellent runner for middle distance training also perfect for gym,CDI86
5,05/18/2017,The nicest version of uncaged ever! Where do I even start? Collab between Adidas and Parley is probably one of the most attractive designs I came across with boost shoes. Fantastic looking knitwear and so comfortable!,CDI86
5,05/18/2017,"Great comfortable shoe These shoes are great, really comfortable and look brillant",CDI86
5,05/18/2017,Blown away. First pair of any Adidas in a very long time. These are the single most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet. Not to mention they look incredible and are made sustainably while cleaning our oceans. Love every single thing about these.,CDI86
2,05/17/2017,"Parley colorway is way too tight on bridge of foot—much worse than previous iterations of Uncaged. Quality shoes, but holy smokes they're uncomfortable. The Parley Uncaged is super, super tight on the bridge of the foot. So tight that it cut of both my circulation and my brother's. Length and width are perfect so I don't think moving up a size would be advisable. The other Uncaged I have worn aren't a problem, but the Parley colorway is super uncomfortable. Go caged or if you want Uncaged, go with another colorway.",CDI86
3,05/17/2017,"Awesome cause. disappointing sizing. I was incredibly excited to find that my shoes had arrived. But, turns out they are TOO TIGHT. I am size 12 in Ultraboost so i figured ordering half a size bigger would differentiate this particular shoe's size. Disappointed.",CDI86
1,05/15/2017," The Parley shoes are too TIGHT. I have the same size of UltraBOOST Uncaged Shoes, which are so perfect and comfortable. They shouldn't have this kind of difference, right?",CDI86
2,05/15/2017,Disappointed with my purchase! Just received my new Adidas in the mail.  Was super excited until I tried them on and noticed the middle of the inner sole was not properly glued in and created this uncomfortable slack/bump which I felt when walking.  Disappointed with the poor build quality.  Will return for a refund.,CDI86
5,05/15/2017,"Glad to live in the BOOST ERA Wait, BOOST out of OCEAN TRASH?????

Wait, I bought BOOST when I didn't know they made this UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME SHOE,
now they make it out of TRASH

it's not just made from scratch, they made a GRADE AAA+ quality shoe out of TRASH.

THANK YOU is ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

THANK YOU",CDI86
4,05/14/2017,"High quality, but too narrow  by far! My word these are TIGHT! Very high quality, a lovely shoe, but my Size UK 10 were very very tight on my foot, a little uncomfortable if honest.",CDI86
5,05/13/2017,"Best uncaged I've owned Very good product! Fits like a charm, looks very nice on feet. I get a ton of compliments rocking these around school and the mall. I would definitely recommend these to a friend just because these are going to sell out and people are going to regret not getting them.",CDI86
1,05/13/2017,"Make More Ultra Boost & Less Uncaged!! Make More Regular Ultra Boost!!! I love Adidas and Ultra Boost, but you are missing the mark on the product demand. The regular Ultra Boost is preferred by customers who buy them for running, but you can NEVER find them. Case and point Parley Ultra Boost sold out in 10 minutes and you can still get Uncaged Ultra Boost 3 days later. It is extremely frustrating. If you start shopping when you have 200 miles on your shoes, it is doubtful that you will find a pair before you break 300 miles. Uncaged run too small and are not nearly as good for running! Listen to your customer demand. Shift supply from Uncaged to Regular Ultra Boost",CDI86
5,05/12/2017,"Amazing shoe. Great collab As my first experience with and Ultra Boost model i have to say I am beyond impressed. Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Cannot wait to take these to the track. It'd be nice if these weren't so popular amongst the sneaker heads, so actual runners can have a shot at scoring some of the more popular releases. Keep up the great work Adidas!",CDI86
5,05/11/2017,"Your missing out on this flame Your missing out on this flame shoe, get them before they are gone.",CDI86
5,05/10/2017,"Nice Very nice, looks comfy, i recommend it for others.",CDI86
4,12/01/2017," Fit very well, comfortable right out of the box. The only thing is that if you kinda have wide feet then it may be hard to put on due to the one piece construction but when they’re on they’re probably one of the comfiest shoes to wear.",CDM05

2,08/14/2017, Material of shoes does not wear well. Looked terrible after 1 wear.,CDM05
3,08/11/2017, I like the shoes however they are tighter than the other 81/2 I got,CDM05

5,07/31/2017,"Incredibly comfortable The shoes look very nice. Also once you put them on, they fit like a glove, and feel very nice. As long as you use the loops on the tongue and heel, they aren't too hard to put on. Deffinitely would recommend.",CDM05
5,07/28/2017, Pretty good shoe recommend it to anyone interested,CDM05
2,07/21/2017, Much bulkier than in the pictures. The bootie with external suede upper makes for a very wide appearance on the foot.,CDM05

5,10/27/2017,"Very cool shoes! Just got these today, feel great on my feet! I do see what people mean by the size seeming large. There is more space past my toes than I'm used to, but everything feels great for running, jumping, etc., so I can't tell if that's a design thing. You probably CAN go a half size down if desired and have them still fit well! Love the look! Love the feel on my feet! Extremely happy with this purchase and expect I'll be ordering more from Adidas soon!!",BDZ41
4,10/25/2017,good for training I bought t these for running which was a mistake because these shoes are best for training and in case weight lifting these sneakers are great. but not good for running. therefore I returned them.,BDZ41

5,09/17/2017,"Seriously most comfortable shoes I've had!! Technically these are for running, I use them for training my legs/thighs/glutes.. and just going out! 

I can wear them for hours, so comfy! Faded peachy orange color is beautiful in person, and it has that yeezy's look :D. Also I really like the bottoms of these.

I usually wear 8.5, that's what I got and it feels perfect but not too tight of a fit. Would recommended 100000%",BDZ41
5,09/14/2017,"Stylish, but not what I was expecting I like the shoes in the aspect of style, but I was highly expecting for them to be super comfortable as well. I walk a lot during the day, and I don't get as much support on my heels like I hoped. I got a 9.5 instead of my regular shoe size which is a 10, but I should have bought a size 9 instead because my shoes fit pretty big on my feet. One thing I like about the shoes is the width and being able to tighten my shoes on my mid foot, especially after ordering a bigger shoe size.",BDZ41
5,08/22/2017," Zestfully comfortable shoe! Since yellow is my favorite color, Adidas scored on these Alphabounce  EM running shoes. Like walking on air. So lightweight!",BDZ41

Thanks Adidas!",BDZ37
5,10/28/2017,Best trainers I’ve owned. I’m not usually a trainers guy but these are pretty well the best I’ve had. Super comfortable. Period. They are sized a little big so try and size down a half to a full size. They will fit snug but once broken in you won’t want to take them off.,BDZ37

4,10/22/2017,"Nice comfortable shoe but.... Shoes were better looking than even I had expected. They were very comfortable as well but fit a little bit bigger and narrower than my older adidas shoes. I was able to return the shoes and get a 1/2 size smaller. As a side note, I did notice that these shoes are a little warm when wearing around for a bit, but the comfort more than makes up for that",BDZ37

4,11/15/2017,"Love these! They look stylish without being over the top and they feel like walking on a cloud. My roommate, who is a personal trainer, wanted to steal them straight away. I let her try them on. Better keep an eye on them.",GTG76

3,11/07/2017,"Good looking shoe, runs too big Overall a well designed shoe but it runs about a size too big if not bigger. I'm just annoyed with the sizing overall in the adidas brand. It's too up and down and it's hard to find the right fit. I used to always be a 7.5 now I can be a 6 sometimes which is crazy. Anyhow got these on sale so not bad but should of definitely got 1 size smaller just didn't have time to deal with return and exchange at that time.",GTG76
4,10/31/2017,"Very comfy shoes I'll only buy Adidas shoes for the gym, i found other brands just don't provide as much comfort and durability. Great shoes, would happily recommend but I needed a full size bigger than my normal for a perfect fit.",GTG76
4,10/30/2017,"Love it! What attracted to this sneaker was the gray color! Its a great looking shoe. Initially, I ordered my usual size 6.5 but had to return it and get a 7 instead. It’s very comfortable and the front part is wide enough so your toes are not crammed it. I went on a run and the cushion of the shoe is good but I can imagine if I keep using it to run I will notice a difference in the sneakers.",GTG76

3,09/24/2017,"Too small to decide to keep Shoe colors were super cute and probably would have been very comfortable but they were way too small. I usually wear a 9 in most brands. I bought 2 pairs of adidas at the same time (one being this pair) and the other pair fit perfectly while I could barely get my feet into these ones. Long story short, super cute but if you want any space at all for your toes I would buy a full size bigger.",GTG76

5,08/27/2017,"Good buy This is my 4th pair of Adidas shoes in the past year. I feel like sizes vary, as well as fit depending on the style (boost, edgelux, alpha bounce, etc.). I do like the fit as I use these for coaching, not for activity. I would need a 1/2 size bigger if I were to workout in them. Still super comfortable and supportive.",GTG76

4,08/01/2017,"Cool shoes. Inconsistent sizing. These shoes look great in person. I had to return, get refunded, and reorder them in a 1/2 a size bigger because they run a bit small. Wish adidas online customer service wouldnt make things so complicated when it comes to their ""no exchange"" policy. Boggles my mind that they don't when the have the most inconsistent sizing across the board in their shoes. Out of 4 different adidas styles, I have to use THREE different sizes. Other than that, once you find the right size for you, they're comfortable and with really cool design.",GTG76
5,07/30/2017,LOVE. Best purchase I've made in awhile These shoes are literally perfect. Everyone asks me where I got them.,GTG76

5,07/06/2017,"From running to training happy These shoes are very comfortable, I received them in the avenue a summer box, so I have been using them for a little while, I have some issues in knees and feet so finding a shoe comfortable for me is hard, I like their support and stability, they are roomie so I am not sure how this could fit in narrow fit, but for me they are perfect. I use them for running but I can switch to training and so far they feel good for me. As a bonus I have received a lot of compliments about them, I personally like how they look and the material, they are a very good looking shoes.",GTG76

1,11/27/2017,"Poor product construction/development Bought these shoes for my son. In addition to his regular everyday activities; He also participates in the 100 mile Club and runs about 10miles a week. After only 3 weeks of wearing the shoes with the above mentioned wear and tear, the shoe began to show early signs of dilamination of the the plastic/rubber material from the shoe fabric in the front of the shoe. This is definitely a production issue where the glue used is substandard or wasn’t applied properly. Upon discovering the issue we contacted Adidas customer service and informed them that the shoe was falling apart. Instead of standing by their product and offering a refund or a replacement, we were advised to go back to where we purchased the shoe, “Finish Line”. Unfortunately, at Finish Line they only offered us a credit for the current price of the shoe. Which was $25 less than what we paid for. I’m usually impressed with the adidas that I purchase due to the amount of wear and tear I can put on the shoes from running, hiking, or trail work. Unfortunately, this time the product failed and Adidas didn’t care to standby their product.",BEG77
5,11/24/2017,"This was my favourite adidas product I have bought this year! I love this product because it is so comfortable when running, and they are aesthetically pleasing as well.",BEG77
1,10/23/2017,Will not last a month!! I got a pair of these for my 6 year old. After two weeks the rubber around the toes detached and on week 3 it tore! Don’t waste your money buying these shoes because you WILL regret it like I did.,BEG77

5,05/19/2017,OMG!  How have I lived without you? These are my first pair of Ultraboosts.

3,05/01/2017,"Great shoe; just not quite right for my foot. Adorable shoes, but just were't the right fit for me feet. The ultra boost x model has a more molded shape than the ultra boost and it hit my arch in a very weird and uncomfortable way. I'm bummed because these shoes are so great-looking, and the boost material is awesome. (I ended up getting a pair of regular ultra boosts which fit great!)",CEM26

5,04/10/2017,"Comfortable and stylish shoes for running & walking! Got the Oreo black & white color before this release. Very comfortable and perfect fit! Although I had to buy half size up in order to fit my tropical Asian swollen fit into the shoes sock like the Uncaged. Only problem is when I pull my feet out, the insoles may run out but for this Stella McCartney Ultraboost X, I noticed that the insoles are glued in - unlike the Ultraboost Uncaged which is not glued. So can't really be adjusted back?",CEM26
5,04/09/2017,"worth every penny I love how it feels while I'm wearing it, the arch is perfect it just a nice support. The style is incredible as well. Great design and colors. 100% would buy again.",CEM26

5,03/31/2017,"Walking on sunshine! Gorgeous! Love them so much! Very comfortable beautiful as well. I'm an RN and all my feet all day. Very hard to find shoes that wrap my feet in heaven for hours on end like these do. Wish they came in wide but I love my new kicks, regardless! Bouncy step and hug your foot all the way around, as well. The pic I uploaded was me wearing them at work today :)",CEM26
5,03/31/2017,So very happy that i got them! I am a big fan of recycling and i was thrilled to find out about the Ultra Boost X SMC had parley!,CEM26
5,03/30/2017, Super stylish and comfortable. These are great for the gym - the only concern I have is how long they will last but we'll see!,CEM26
5,03/22/2017," Easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. It feels like a cloud and the material is so unique. I'm usually a solid 8 with all my shoes, 7 with most adidas because they run a tad large, but I got these in a 7.5 and they're perfect. Definitely recommend!",CEM26
3,03/21/2017,"1/2 size up for thick socks, 1 size up for wide feet This is my first Adidas x Parley purchase ever, and I must say that I'm disappointed by what I receive. The design is great, the cause is amazing, but the execution doesn't live up to my expectation. I've spotted:
- 3 holes in the Boost material (2 are pictured)
- 2 stains in the Primeknit material (1 is pictured)
- 2 areas with loose thread (1 is pictured)
- 1 area with uneven stitching (pictured)
- Scratched box (pictured)
I really wanted to love this pair, as I had been waiting for it to release. After I was notified, I hopped online immediately to get one. I really hope that it's just my pair that is faulty. Even though personally I'll return it, I'll still recommend this product to my friends because of the cause it supports.",CEM26
5,03/18/2017, its perfect on my foots ! its comfortable! its beautiful!,CEM26
4,12/05/2017,Great shoe with cool style but not for running. Great style and and very comfortable right out of the box. Love the colors and the material. That being said they are definitely more of a fashion shoe than a running shoe. Some people complained about not having insoles but didn't bother me. I ran in them a few times but will keep them mainly as casual shoes.,DWH89
5,12/03/2017,Love them Great Product and the is the second pair in a month,DWH89
5,11/03/2017," I have worn these for about 4 months now, running in the shoes 5 days a week. They have held up great, just some marks on the front where the upper material has scraped the ground. They make you feel like you have springs on your feet.
I will say that if you are planning on standing on your feet for the entire day, they can begin to hurt you feet because there is not much support.

3,10/08/2017,"Great but didn’t hold up that well I love the shoes but I have been wearing them for about two months and they have started to break down, the rubber at the back is cracking, the color on the outside of the boost is falling off etc.",DWH89

4,09/14/2017,"welcome to the future This unique version of ""Night Cargo"" is dark olive interlaced with a shade of flesh (from a distance, this colorway gives the illusion of brown).  Combined with a black midsole, it's a conservative looking running shoe that's attractive with almost any clothing and works in almost any athletic or social situation.  However, there's a couple of spots of white stitching on this colorway that stick out like a sore thumb...making it look like I repaired a tear with dental floss!  

There's no insole included...which wouldn't be an issue if there was more arch support.  There is some light arch support designed into the shoe's frame, but it's not quite satisfactory even for my medium arches.  The included extra laces are unnecessary garbage and, imo, should be replaced with optional medium-arched insoles.

The polyester knit upper is more breathable than most shoes, but still a little humid in summer.  However, I actually prefer this basic knit because it's more supportive than ""primeknit"".  Increasing this support is pureBoost's lacing system (which includes internal/hidden mid-foot straps)...when laced snug, it just feels much more ""locked in"" than even the more high-end Boost models.

I had reservations about the ""burrito"" tongue.  It can bunch up when putting on the shoe, but, once straightened out (easy), it feels completely un-noticeable.   This version of burrito tongue is different/better than burrito tongues on other brands...I think it's actually better than even the old standard-type tongues.

There's no padding on the ankle collar, which might matter if you run a lot.  The heel-cup is excellent...but, if you don't lace snugly, you might get slight ""heel lift"".

Boost is among the best sole cushioning I've ever felt in a running shoe (and I've tried most of the ""maximalist"" brands).",DWH89

5,08/24/2017,"My favourite running shoes to date! These shoes are comfortable, stylish, durable and have great grip. The single piece upper makes the show fit like a sock, and doesn't cause pressure or pinching on the top of your foot.
The slightly wider rubber sole is great for support and stability, but doesn't affect the fit, which is what you want in a running shoe.

I love them for gym, running, hiking and lifestyle wear.

Overall a great shoe!",DWH89
4,08/20/2017,Style and Comfort Wanted rugged style with comfort and this shoe delivers. Runs a little big and did not come with an insole. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,DWH89

The boost is a truely unique feeling, I've had the shoes for a couple months now, it is extremely comfortable but also very responsive. It seems like those two words wouldn't be used together when talking about a running shoe but yet here they are. The folded tongue also has not been a problem and is actually pretty stylish, and the durability of the shoe seems to be doing great. I honestly have no bad words about these shoes.",DWH89

5,08/11/2017,"Comfortable Shoe I know that these are meant for guys, but I wanted this color and they did not have this style/color in the ladies section.

I wear a 7.5 in ladies and got the 6.5 (smallest size they make in this option).  They fit more like an 8 in ladies, but I don't mind the extra room.  If you have a narrow foot, this would not be the right shoe for you.  My foot is in-between normal and wide and it feels like I have lots of room for my toes, more than it would in a ladies shoe.  I am very happy with the purchase and will be putting them to the ultimate test this weekend at the OC Fair.  I think they will fair well. *pun intended",DWH89

3,07/19/2017,"Great looking shoe, be wary of injury The shoe looks great, although after my first run in these the black boost got caked with a layer of dirt, so I had to wash that off, and that took extra time which I should have seen coming. After my second run, I was walking home when the outside tendon below my right ankle began to hurt a lot, and it sidelined me for about a week. I believe that it was due to the fact that the collar digs into your foot on the outside in general, but it especially does so on turns. In general I wouldn't recommend the shoe for running, especially for the price.",DWH89
4,07/18/2017,"Great purchase! These shoes are well-made and extremely comfortable to walk, run, and work out in.

2,07/07/2017,"Would be a perfect shoe if the quality of the sole matched the rest of the shoe. It's a good looking shoe and it fits well but the quality of the sole is subpar.

3,06/23/2017,I like adidas shoes but the prices are a bit much. Not sure I got what I paid for with these. Definitely not worth 170. I've wearing some form of the boost shoes for the past three running shoes I've Owned.  Been eyeing the ultra boost forever but couldn't pull the trigger cause of the price. Liked these cause of the black sole. Figured I would suck it up and drop the extra cash. Not worth the extra money in my opinion. Maybe the ultra boost shoes are much better but to me there isn't much difference between this and other cheaper boost shoes I had in past. Hope it helps someone save a couple bucks.,DWH89

5,11/09/2017,Sooo comfy!!!! Comfortable shoes and very light. High quality material!,DWG39
3,11/06/2017,"Amazing 3m look but the collar has issues. First off what I love, the upper 3m material and flash effect is amazing, and the thicker Continental bottom outsole is great. And I would love to see both features on a normal ultraboost. 

The comfort is great. I liked the extra padding on the sides and ankle. And dispite the unpopularity, I like the tongue on these. However the sizing is still frustrating. I had to go a half size down. I have a wide foot and wear 11 in eqt and nmd. But the 10.5 in these and the wool series ultraboost fit me perfectly. 

What I disliked were the off color grey laces. I liked that they were round laces but should of been 3m to match or black in color at least. The boost on mine around the hard plastic parts were slightly not painted and you could see a little white. At the high price point should have a higher quality control inspection. 

The high collar and I believe uniquely to my pair of shoes I really dislike. So much if I were able to exchange for another pair I would immediately but it's not option with super limited number release and this is the reason I could NOT give this shoe a 5 star rating. The high collar on the Left is more a white color and more like the example pictures. However, the Right pair looks like they used the same material for the uppers. So basically the left looks white and other collar looks black land looks like I'm wearing mismatched socks.",DWG39
5,11/06/2017,"Was a big surprise that they glow like diamonds because of the 3M, fit TTS. Very comfortable, the white sole adds a nice pop..",DWG39
4,11/06/2017,"Another great UB, but the price hurts UB ATR Oreo is really nice. Shoe fits true to size (I have a narrow foot and go a half size down for UB 3.0 for reference). Primeknit stretchiness is in between a UB 2.0 and 3.0. Ankle collar fits really nice and is not too restrictive. This shoe has 3m reflective all throughout the PK something adidas did not advertise (see picture). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the price is wayyy too high. Adidas prices are out of control at this point and I think it is a strategy to put off resellers but it really hurts the consumer.",DWG39
4,11/05/2017,Most comfortable shoe ever worn I like this shoe because it's very comfortable and it could be worn in the snow.,DWG39
5,11/03/2017,"Impeccable!!! These ATR Ultraboost Mids are great. They are almost as comfy as the Original Ultraboost. The collar around the ankle is a nice fit, not too thick, tight or loose. The Water Resistance of them is excellent. 1 major thing Adidas left out of the description is they r 3M. When I went to take a pic of them on foot, the Flash on my cam made them Bling back at me. They look great on foot as well. These may be my fav pair of Adidas of all time. That’s saying something as I’ve got about 35pair of Adidas n about 20 are some Version of Ultraboost. The rest being NMD/EQT or something else. I highly recommend u buy a pair of these if u can find them in ur size. I’m not on the hunt for another size 12 so I can double up.

5,10/25/2017,"Great comfort and well made for leisure First of all, I didn't get this shoe for running in on any trails or even on tarmac. I can't speak to that. What I can speak to is it's comfort on foot, sizing, and looks. Firstly it's extremely comfortable. It's snug like a 2.0 but comfortable like a 3.0. The primeknit is amazing. Slightly thicker than 3.0. The support around the angle is next level. The sole is thicker and to me, feels more comfortable all round than a 3.0. I wear these with jeans mostly and they look awesome. At this price, it's hard to justify the expense so I will probably only have one pair for now. Highly recommend for leisure, walking, and looking good for fall/winter.",DWG39

1,09/05/2017,Not worth the price So I'm about 30 miles into these shoes and the only thing they are good for is running on a flat hard packed dirt road. The upper is way too soft and stretchy any side to side movement and the upper will stretch basically to the point the side of your foot hits the ground. For being called an all terrain shoe these are far from it. Every time I wear these on a trail that is even the slightest bit technical I roll my ankle multiple times because the upper is not strong enough or sturdy enough. The sole is good and provides a soft but responsive run but isn't the shoe I was hoping for. Hopefully adidias fixes this in later models,DWG39

They are definitely worth the expense.",DWI04

5,12/03/2017,"Comfortable Lightweight and Flexible The shoe feels like exactly what I was looking for: a running shoe with complete barefoot flexibility, for landing mid/front. I think the issue with the sizing most people have can be solved by purchasing higher-end lightweight socks. I first used my standard sneaker socks, and indeed the Adios was too tight. But, then I figured I could upgrade my socks, and problem solved. Maybe that's what Adidas was thinking?",KEK81

5,12/02/2017,"Great performance running shoes! The Adios 3 are great for road runs at any speed. They are lightweight and have ample cushioning to help you run faster. Looks wise, they have a retro feel with some modern technologies mixed in, giving the shoe a sleek appearance. Fit wise, go true to size or half size up since the toe-box is a bit snug. The durability on the Adios 3 is pretty decent, the upper is made from a mesh and suede construction, keeping your foot locked down during runs. The Boost midsole makes each step feel energized and the cushioning doesn't deteriorate that much over time. Overall, this is a great shoe for training and races!",KEK81
5,12/02/2017,"My Go-To Race Day Shoe I was introduced to this model a little more than a year ago by my local running store, and it's been a revelation and game changer for me. The shoe is light, fast, responsive and comfortable enough because of the Boost material to be a Race Day shoe for 5k to road marathons. I've PR'd in all the distances in the past year in no small part because of this shoe. I have so much confidence in the fit, grip and ride of this shoe that I don't even have to think about whether to buy more. I can't think of a more perfect racing shoe.  

At the recommendation of my LRS I sized up about a half size, and it gives my forefoot just enough extra room for the splay and slight swelling that occurs over a marathon distance. 

The only regret that I have about this shoe is that the outsole tends to wear through to the torsion plate at less than 300 miles for me. I know this is because of my slightly supinating footstrike, and I don't fault the design of the shoe and its choice of materials.",KEK81
5,11/15/2017,"These shoes are made for running, fast! It's my second pair of adios boost and I just like them so much, they make me run faster and feel very comfortable. These shoes are very responsive, perfect for racing and running fast but still enough comfort to do your longer runs too (ran a marathon with my previous pair). They're like the best of both worlds",KEK81
5,11/13/2017,Super lightweight fast shoe Have only tried them out once since my plan is to save them for races but I was very impressed with them. Super lightweight but still very bouncy and comfortable. I did a 5k Time Trial on the track with them and got a new PR. The shoe is very stylish and I love the colour.,KEK81
5,11/10/2017,"Love these shoes Having purchased Adios previously, I have consistently found the shoe to be light, quick, responsive and exceptionally durable. The fit is true to size, and the colours are true to the picture. These can be worn on race day for longer races, or as a lightweight trainer for most days (my go to shoe most days).",KEK81

3,11/02/2017,"These run small, order half a size up The shoes feel fast, and I like that they're lightweight and have the mesh upper that allows breathability. However it took a while to find the right fit since I have wider feet and these run narrow - I'd suggest ordering half a size up. 

Unfortunately the mesh material is not very durable - after just a month in these shoes the mesh upper started to tear near the right pinky toe, and every time I wear these shoes the hole gets visibly bigger. I'm doing marathon training at about 50+ miles per week (though I wear different shoes if I'm doing a slow easy run, so they don't take all my mileage), so I know that puts a lot of wear and tear on them. However, my first pair of Adios's had no issues as to the material durability, so I may have just received a defective product. It hasn't even been 2 months yet and now the fabric tear is at least 1.5 inches long. Unfortunately I'm 1 month away from our race, and it's probably too late to switch to a new shoe model, so I'm hoping my next pair that I just ordered actually holds up this time.",KEK81
4,11/02/2017,"I've been wearing this model for the last three years. Light. Comfortable. No injuries from poor fit. I started running in Adios series shoes three years ago. When they wear out, I just reorder in the latest colour. My only gripe ... the soles wear out to quickly and the toes get holes.",KEK81

5,10/20/2017,"Best running shoes Light, fast, comfortable, perfect all around shoes",KEK81
5,10/19/2017,"Excellent purchase. I ordered a pair through Amazon and they recommended half a size larger. Good thing they did because they fit perfectly. I also ordered through Amazon because they had a version that was $40 less due to the color which is so horrible (Solar Red?!). Luckily, I don't mind the color for running shoes. Then Adidas lowered the price on the light blue ones and since I love the fit, I bought a pair of those. The colors I actually like (the black ones or white ones) are too expensive. But the shoes are incredible. They're light, sleek, breathable. I don't know how long I will be able to run with them, I run around 15 miles per week, but I have the purchase date and so when they're worn out I'll see. Good thing is I only use them for running because of the flamboyant color (I run very early in the morning). It's a shame because they are just so pretty. I would love to wear them with jeans but I don't want the shoes to attract the attention of helicopters flying overhead.",KEK81
5,10/13/2017,Best running shoes ever Best fit i ever had in running shoes. They are super comfortable. No more knee pain!,KEK81
4,10/13/2017,"Great shoes but will not last for long. I love Adidas styling and product design. These shoes I bought for going to the gym, not for outdoor running. Although my feet are very standard and I always wear size 42, I got these shoes in size 42 1/3 this time and they still turned out to be too small and too tight for me. Besides that the strips of artificial suede on the nose and sides of the shoes will get soiled very quickly and so will the white foam soles. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase, except for the wrong size.",KEK81
3,10/12/2017,inconsistent sizing I tried on a pair of Adidas Adizero Adios 3 at the Adidas store and 9.5 fit perfectly. I purchased the same shoe from Adidas.com and it was too big and uncomfortable. Need to return and try again. Sigh.,KEK81
2,10/12/2017,Too small I've worn a size 12 in this shoe for several years. They seem much smaller. I returned them with no hassle but I'm hesitant to even try a size 13 because the 12 felt at least 2 sizes too small.,KEK81
5,10/02/2017," Great fit! Nice, flat sole. The color does standout, for sure.",KEK81
5,10/01/2017,Perfect snug fit (I choose 1/2 size up than regular size). Comfortable for everyday use as well as long runs. 2nd pair of adizeros. I really like the quality and fit.,KEK81
4,09/29/2017,"Great overall shoes. Lighter than expected in colour. Magnet for scuffs.

Solid fit, heel to toe. Great all-day comfort shoes.",KEK81
2,09/29/2017,I returned these because they were at least a half size off of not a full size. They also had a flimsy feel to them. Poor sizing and flimsy feel earned these a return trip back to Adidas.,KEK81
1,09/29/2017,runs 1/2 to full size small Seems decent but runs 1/2 to a full size small.  Bad news for a size 13.  Reviews seem pretty consistent I wonder how Adidas lets this happen...,KEK81
4,09/24/2017,"fantastic great fit, comfortable just what i was looking for",KEK81
2,09/19/2017,"A shoe that didn't last When I first bought this shoe, either it came laced or I laced it too tight. My feet would hurt after light runs or walks. I slowly kept loosening the laces all the way to the bottom and I finally found a really comfortable shoe.

I've owned these shoes for 6 months, and I would describe them as EXTREMELY worn. My dog ate my last running shoes (thanks Ada) and I started wearing these on walks about 3 months ago. The Continental sole was a selling point to me because I really enjoy their bicycle/car tires, but now I don't think they last. I don't have data to back this up, but I would break down my 6 months as such:

Month 1: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 2: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 3: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bunch)
Month 4: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bit more)
Month 5: 130 miles walking on pavement, 20 miles running on pavement, 15 miles on dirt paths (dog ate other shoes, these are all I've got)
Month 6: 110 miles walking on pavement, 10 miles running on pavement, 30 miles on dirt paths (something feels off)
DONEZO!

I'm disappointed with this shoe. I was hoping for them to last at least a quarter of the time of my Nike Free running shoes, but they just didn't hold up. It's ok if they were meant for short distance grip, I just expected a bit more longevity.",KEK81
5,09/13/2017,Best trainers super comfy! These are great. Get half a size up! Quality. Nice!,KEK81
4,09/10/2017,"Excelent trainers, but be careful with size These are excellent trainers. They're light, airy and they look fantastic compared to the garish coloured running trainers from other manufacturers. I've run over 300km in them so far (with individual runs over 30km) and I haven't received a blister yet. However, be very careful with the size. I'm consistently size 10, as measured in many shoe shops and running specialists, however I had to return my original size 10 orders and re-order a size 11. Note that I couldn't find a single high street stockist after searching four towns, so I couldn't try any on before buying.

There is also a minor quality issue (but one I wouldn't have expected given the high price). The lace retaining loops on the tongues are in completely different places on each shoe. This is shown in the attached photograph. On the right shoe the loop is between the third and fourth eyelets, and on the left shoe it's between the fourth and fifth.

Furthermore, there were no care instructions included with the trainers. I expected some to be provided.

Overall I would highly recommend these trainers, but if you can try some on and inspect the quality before buying, do so.",KEK81
5,09/09/2017,Very comfortable Very lightweight and also comfortable. Well suited to short distance runs.,KEK81

5,09/08/2017,Great pair of shoes! Needed a full size bigger than normal. Light and fast but feet feel supported. Great colour!,KEK81
5,09/06/2017,"True to size!!! Amazingly comfortable and light!! So, after reading all the previous comments I was concerned that by ordering them in my regular size they would be too small. I ordered them a half-size up and they were too big. I ended up ordering a second pair in my regular size and they were a perfect fit!

They are incredibly comfortable and light. I ran 20 miles with them the first day and had no soreness or fatigue - just an amazing shoe!

I see now why these are used by so many for marathon races and I will happily be sporting these for my next race coming up. Thanks, Adidas!

I should also note that Adidas' return policy is incredibly hassle-free and easy. I was very impressed how promptly they refunded me and simple they made the process. Awesome job! You have a customer for life!! :)",KEK81
4,09/03/2017,"too small, and way too narrow Don't know why Adidas makes almost ALL their shoes too narrow in the toe area. I see the same criticism in so many reviews for years for all sorts of shoes made by Adidas. Some of them are ok. Some (like leather) can be stretched. Others, like these just won't work for anyone without narrow feet (specifically in the toe box). Otherwise pretty good shoes. If they fit you, you will probably like them.",KEK81

5,07/24/2017,"A great compromise between speed and durability Adizero Adios 3 is great for runners wanting more control and feel, and less cushioning.

5,07/11/2017,"The best racing shoes This is a great shoe for speed. As the other reviews say, order at least 1/2 size since they do run small. Also, they are a bit narrow, but since my foot is more on the narrow side, they fit perfectly. They are exceptionally comfortable and make you feel light and fast the moment you put them on. These shoes served me well for Boston and I have been using them in the months since, achieving PRs while still maintaining enough support and comfort - even on gravel trails I've had no issue. The boost is unmatched, and they are undoubtedly the best running shoes I've ever had. If you are looking for a lot of cushioning in your running shoe, this pair might not be for you, but otherwise, I couldn't recommend these enough.",KEK81
4,07/11/2017,"An odd shoe I've grown to love. An odd shoe that I've grown to love. I wear a 10 in Stan Smith but an 11.5 in these!! 1.5 sizes bigger than any other Adidas I own. I've added a surefoot carbon footbed to it and now it's perfect. It's a bit narrower in the toe box than I like and getting the larger size makes it fit right. One drawback is that the toe will then catch on a sidewalk crack because my body is not used to having that bit of extra length on my feet. Overall it's daily wear and runs, I just ordered another. I love light minimal shoes and this one works.",KEK81

Only issue is the sole wears out on the outside a bit too quickly which shortens the life of the trainers when the rest of the shoe is in perfect working order.

Granted, they are very different, but some of the design aspects especially in the front are similar. Love these shoes.  Will say that there is far less room in the toe box than other Adidas size 12 shoes, but are so light and have lots of ventilation and flex that they are very comfortable. Good for running as there is less foot slide.  The ultra boost material is great in the heel, but slightly thin on the sole, but still very comfortable even with my psoriatic arthritis. 

Love the colour and the design and they look the biz!",KEK81

About 4 years ago, they appear to have sized down ALL of their forms (all least in the soccer and running lines). So if you had a comfy pair you bought 5 years ago, GO AT LEAST A HALF SIZE UP. Also, if you don't want obnoxious colors, you'll have to go with the customized version, which, at considerable cost, will allow you to get rid of the obnoxiously bright colors.

5,03/16/2017,"Versatile, lightweight and great looks I have 3 pairs of the Adios and they are brilliant for training and racing. As a GB Age Group athlete and Duathlete these are perfect shoes and will continue to wear them in competitions.",KEK81
5,03/15/2017, Very light and comfortable.............................,KEK81
5,03/14/2017,Perfect! Been running in the adios since their first incarnation and won't use anything else. Perfect for training and racing. Light and comfortable. Love the new colours too.,KEK81
3,03/12/2017," Size was to small, shoes look very good, order large than you normally have",KEK81
5,03/10/2017, Those trainers looks cool with colours perfectly match each other also they very light too,KEK81
5,03/09/2017,A great all rounder Very Happy with purchase. Shoe feels very light yet the support is very good. Would be happy to use across a range of distances,KEK81
5,03/07/2017,Quality fast shoe... They are as described light comfortable and quite smart to look at. Will purchase another pair soon.,KEK81
3,03/04/2017,"Disappointed in quality for the price As a newbie to running training for my first Tri and Half Marathon, I wanted to get some advice on great quality shoes. Was recommended these by a sales dude at a local running store. Wore a hole through both pinky toe areas within a couple months (under 200 miles in them). Disappointed in the quality, as I paid around $160 for them and had hoped they'd last more than a couple months.",KEK81
1,03/04/2017,"Beware!!!! Toe box is wayyyyyy to small, I ordered a half size up and my feet were in serious pain!!!",KEK81
5,03/03/2017,"Excellent Shoes - will buy again! Comfortable straight out the box, my 4th pair have run everything from park run to marathons and got excellent times. Mesh does wear a little thin after a few hundred miles!! Best running shoes i've had for comfort and speed. Have even used them on trails very successfully.",KEK81
5,03/03/2017,Fastest shoes ever used Great shoes with an outstanding response. I improved my running pace by 20 sec/km on my first run. The cushioning is ok for a 2-3 hours run but I wouldn't recommend it for longer training.,KEK81
2,03/02/2017,"Unfortunately disappointed. I was expecting a lot from the Adizero. As the shoe was not available at my usual running stores, I had to order it online so I had to guess the size. Depending on the model, I am usually a 9.5 or 10. I ordered a 10 however they felt big, so I ordered a 9.5 and they felt too tight. In short they felt uncomfortable. I also found them to be somewhat stiff for a performance running shoe.",KEK81
3,03/01/2017,"Buy the Adidas ultra BOOST, more expensive but a lot better fit The quality of the product was really good, however the sizing was poor, you really need at least one size up",KEK81
4,03/01/2017,Perfect for short distance running I run 40 - 50 miles week whilst commuting to work. They are light and robust and can handle most terrains. My only criticism is that the sole wears very quickly.,KEK81
4,02/27/2017,"Ive NEVER had a bad pair of Adidas shoes and yet agin these didn't disappoint. I love them! Great shoes, light and fast and won't disappoint.yet again a great pair of shoes from Adidas.",KEK81
5,02/26/2017," One full size up compare to other shooes and it's perfect. Very dynamic, extremely comfortable. I added picture of the shooes with 600+ kilometers. Not that bad.",KEK81
5,02/22/2017,"Great colour and comfort Light, better grip than Adios 2, slightly larger toe box, very happy",KEK81
3,02/20/2017,Too small Trainers were much too small even after ordering half size up from usual size,KEK81
4,02/20/2017,"Too small I have 4 pairs of Adidas size 11. I ordered these in a 12 after reading reviews, still too small. How can the size of a shoe be an arbitrary thing? If I buy a 4cm screw its 4cm, why are you unable to make a shoe using the same basic principles?",KEK81
5,02/16/2017,"Exactly as reported. Light and exact fit The fit is perfect for me. Also, I find that when I run in these shoes I literally feel energized!",KEK81
5,02/15/2017,"Great shoes which have given me many PBs Great pair of shoes, though previous versions are not as durable as I would have hope for.",KEK81
5,02/08/2017,"BEST PURCHASE EVER, Amazingly comfortable! Runner These are a must have",KEK81
4,01/17/2017,"light,fast and narrow racer very responsive and light but to narrow, I had to go 1 size up in this shoe. perfect for intervals and speedwork.",KEK81
2,01/16/2017,Too tight. Doesn't fit like previous models used to. Too narrow and tight. The old version of the adios was perfect and I had multiple pairs for many years. This one is too tight and uncomfortable. Not sure why they changed it at all.,KEK81
5,01/14/2017,Won't buy anything else. Will only run in these! Perfect for those that like a light shoe that is breathable and gives great bounce for long runs. Get half a size up from your normal shoe.,KEK81
4,01/05/2017,"Preferred previous models (although nice look/colors) Previous models (pre-bounce) of Adizero Adios were my favorite running shoes for years (I still wear my old ones). I tried these, but they didn't feel as snug, comfortable and fast as the old ones. Something was off in where the arch sits too. Switched to Boston 6, which are great, if a little thicker in the sole. These, however, may suit others better, so I still reccommend.",KEK81
4,01/02/2017,my fav! really nice and comfy! it's a really good quality and they look nice too!,KEK81
1,12/05/2017,"Cheap Quality, Very Disappointed I purchased these shoes (continental energy boost) at a Finish Line store 2 weeks ago for $164. They feel comfortable but I am super disappointed due to the quality. As it can be seen in the pictures, the sides and rear upper part are already tearing. 
I am not a runner, I only walk so the activity given to these shoes is minimum. For this amount of money I expected a much better built quality. I usually buy another brand, which I can't mention due to Adidas policies, and shoes with this price tag have last me 2-3yrs at least before they start wearing off, but this time I decided to give it a shot to Adidas and the rep at FinishLine was really compelling in regards to these shoes... well, TERRIBLE MISTAKE! I will never again buy Adidas shoes, I wish I could return them and buy me a pair of ****... This is beyond disappointing",BEZ22
5,12/05/2017,"Worth the price, but the sale made it a steal. Great cushioning and good arch support. I would recommend this shoe.",BEZ22
4,11/18/2017," Comfort of these running shoes is really great, their look is nice",BEZ22
3,11/13/2017,I purchased this sneaker for the second time a d have been disappointed in the quality. I purchase this sneaker for the 2nd time however the 2nd version is not as good as the 1st . These sneakers slip on gym floors and also have been quite squeaky while walking on floors where my other sneakers did not these said they were made out of a different type of material used in tire so that may be the difference I am not sure . The gray detail has also started to peel off.,BEZ22
5,11/09/2017,Awesome! Very comfortable! High Quality and very light! Can walk with it all day!,BEZ22
4,11/07/2017,"Soles are very comfortable, hard to get laces right? Love everything about these shoes for road running except the laces. First of all, it’s hard to get the tightness of the shoe just right. I’ve had to readjust multiple times to get the perfect fit. Where the plastic stripes are on the side, can feel a bit tight. Also, the flimsy laces slap my shoes for the entire run. Not a huge deal unless you have to hear that ticking noice for 13 miles.... but overall these are super comfortable, especially the soles and toebox. I have a bunion so the toebox room is the selling point for me.",BEZ22
4,11/07/2017,Fantastic addition to your fitness tools. Great balance between a sick design and performance. I feel supported and light at the same time.,BEZ22
5,11/06/2017,Cant go wrong with energy boost Great shoe a lot of support without being too bulky. Love the design and the range of colours,BEZ22
5,10/30/2017,"Very similar to old model I've been running in these for a little over a year.  The new version is similar to the old, which I loved.  They fit like a glove, great for narrow feet.  Good cushioning for high mileage without too much structural support.  I'm a light weight neutral runner with narrow feet and high arches and these are just right for me.",BEZ22
5,10/28/2017, adidas never has failed me! Always assured a great product. Love this shoe!,BEZ22
5,10/28/2017,Love these shoes This is my third pair of energy boost shoes and my favorite so far. They have such perfect support and are the most comfortable running shoe I’ve ever had.,BEZ22
5,10/26/2017,It is sooo light you don't feel it when running. I love it... It comfy and light and most of all water resistant ..no wet socks in rainny weather..,BEZ22
4,10/21/2017,"Size DOWN My trainer and my soccer-player son both recommended this shoe. I ordered my regular size in a fitness shoe, too big. Ordered 1/2 size smaller, too bit. Am now ordering 1/2 size and full size smaller than I normally wear in a street shoe. My difficulty is that I wear a women's 11 street shoe, so very few, if any, retailers stock my size to try anything on. Adidas website had some colors of the energy boost at 30% off. No other online retailers had the discount (like Zappos, where I wouldn't be waiting 5 business days each time I have to order another size). Do appreciate that Adidas has free return shipping. Just never thought I might wear a 10 in this shoe...",BEZ22
2,10/16/2017,"RETURNED I have been wearing Adidas running shoes for 15 years. The original Energy Boosts were my absolute favorite, and I had 5 pairs of them. I am incredibly hard on my running shoes, so when I wore out the originals I tried the 2's - and they were so uncomfortable! Adidas had completely changed the proportions, so my high arched, narrow feet no longer felt supported. Anyway, I tried several different styles and ultimately went to another brand. 
When the Energy Boost 3's came out I was really excited and I decided to give them another shot... Now not only are they even wider than the 2's, but the sizing is COMPLETELY off. I have worn a 7.5 in Adidas for the last 15 years and these 7.5 Energy Boosts were a half size too big! I thought about exchanging them for a smaller size, but I don't even know if it's worth the aggravation. I'm highly disappointed in you Adidas - bring back the styling of the original boosts or maybe it's just time to switch to another brand permanently.",BEZ22
5,10/15/2017,Most comfortable sneaker I have ever had! I would greatly recommend this sneaker for anyone who is having plantar fasciitis problems like I do!,BEZ22
3,10/13/2017,Returned These did not fit as well as supernovas. Toebox pressed my toe. Didn't feel as supportive as the supernova,BEZ22
5,10/13/2017,"Love these shoes! For me, these shoes are the perfect combination of function (ran the BAA Half last week), and style.",BEZ22
5,10/08/2017,"They feel real good , look real good overall real good Super comfy and a great shoe with great styling that feels good on foot",BEZ22
5,10/07/2017,Favorite workout shoe but be sure to size up I love the energy boost line and was not disappointed with my third pair.  This generation is consistent in size and comfort with my previous pairs. Like my ultra boosts you need to size up a half size. These shoes power me through p90x workouts and several miles a week with no complaints.,BEZ22
4,10/01/2017,"Great looking shoe! Lovely looking shoe, but a little narrow and snug for my foot. Hopefully will get better with time.",BEZ22
5,09/25/2017,"EXCELLENT running shoes! These are the best running shoes I've ever had! I prefer these to the Ultra Boost I had before, without a doubt. They are more stable, but still very soft and very comfortable. I think they protect the feet a little bit more and seem to be more durable than the Ultra Boost, which were a disappointment for me. Normally I run in a path with some stones and irregularities and these Energy Boost do the job very well!",BEZ22
5,09/12/2017,Best shoes ever!I feel comfort with every step. They are soft and comfort and you can feel that in every step. Best shoes ever!,BEZ22
5,09/10/2017,Fits perfect and is pretty freaking good It's very comfortable and fits good. Lmao I think they make me run faster? Overall they pretty dang lit! Would recommend if you like comfy and good quality shoes but if you're not into that then don't get them I guess.,BEZ22
5,09/06/2017,Best for comfort and all day wear.. Perfect fit and support. Overall comfort good as I wear 10 hours a day..,BEZ22
4,09/02/2017,Great running shoe Very comfortable shoe. You can feel the difference in your first steps.,BEZ22
5,08/27/2017,Extremely comfortable and supportive. Excellent for Zumba Lightweight trainers with superb underfoot cushioning. A good fit which offers the support needed for exercising.,BEZ22
5,08/19/2017, Recently wore them at my job as a summer camp counselor and galavanting around Boston--shoes make such a difference!,BEZ22
3,07/31/2017,Cushioned but lots of support! If they feel great with a stress fracture - just think what they will feel like when my foot is healed!,BEZ22
5,07/28/2017,"Like i am walking on cotton bed So ease and comfortable. i have wide feet so most shoes i have tried on were uncomfortable unlike this one. Every time i wear these,i feel like i am up in the air wearing literally nothing. Not the first running shoes i purchased but the first running shoes i like to wear.",BEZ22
5,06/30/2017, I have worn every version the the adidas energy boost and the first has always been my favourite. This update comes pretty close. Thank you adidas for taking away the hard plastic on the mid foot cage!,BEZ22
5,12/05/2017,This is nice Shoes And comfortable I like adidas all time and adidas is best all time for me.,BEZ21
4,12/02/2017,The right shoe seems to be tad loose at the back Very good quality feel and look great half sizes are perfect,BEZ21
5,12/01/2017,Comfy running shoes Well profiled running shoes that allow comfortable training.,BEZ21
5,11/29/2017,"Favorite running show, have three pairs in case they ever change the design. The Energy Boost is all about Comfort and support. Literally dropped 30 seconds off my typical 9 minute mile on day one.",BEZ21
5,11/22/2017,"New favorite shoe! This shoe just feels great. It looks great. It's just awesome. Boost always feels good, but I must say it's the upper on this shoe that steals the show in terms of comfort. The flap on the outsole near the heel is very helpful for keeping them clean. The cage will be a problem if you have wide feet, so be sure to size up accordingly. Although it was one of the worst shipping experiences I have ever had, it was well worth the 11 day wait. Happy with my purchase!",BEZ21
5,11/20/2017,"By far the best runners I've bought! By far the best runners I've bought! I haven't even gone running yet and I know they are perfect! They were perfect fit on arrival, super duper comfy, they look sik with the high viz soles, I highly recommend these for any new or keen runner! Got them from here $140 with free shipping!!",BEZ21
4,11/18/2017,Good medium range running shoes These shoes are great as a starting running shoe with a lot of support and use of boost technology.,BEZ21
5,11/14/2017,"Width seems to vary between products a bit, still really good quality Like the looks and the feeling, seems to do the trick as they should!",BEZ21
3,11/10/2017,"Makes my feet look big It's a comfortable shoe but it makes my feet look big. I got size 9 1/2 and it looks like the same size as a 10 1/2 shoe. If they didn't look so big on me, I would wear it more.",BEZ21
4,11/06/2017,"Look good, too narrow for me I have wide feet and while usually a half size larger helps, the edges of plastic cage on these shoes are too close to the widest part of the foot. Other than this, they felt good underfoot, heel was supported well and they look good.",BEZ21
5,11/04/2017,"One of my best running shoe I've owned Energy boost before so I knew I would need a half size larger because it irritates me when my big toe touches the end. Also, the previous energy boost was tighter/snug all around where this version is not. Overall, it's still worth the purchase. Great feel, comfort, and quality.",BEZ21
5,11/03/2017,Most comfortable running shoe I've every had! Excellent quality. Legs much less sore after running.,BEZ21
4,11/02/2017,"Nice running shoe for easy days. These shoes are very well cushioned, comfortable and very nicely finished.  The combination of the boost foam and a hard rubber outsole hold up very nicely.  I have a close to 2 hundred miles on them and they still feel fresh and new.  On the sizing I think they run a bit long and narrow.  I have relatively long and narrow low volume feet so it works well for me.  These combined with the Boston's for quicker running turn out to be a nice set up for moderately committed runners.",BEZ21
4,10/29/2017,Nice shoe Very quick delivery and price was good. Ryns a little tight,BEZ21
5,10/27/2017,Ultra Boost line is the most comfortable shoe ever made!! I have a pair that is getting to be almost 2 years old and they are still just as comfortable as they were when I bought them! Wish they had more options with the black soles only because the white are tough to keep clean. Other than that they are some of the best shoes I have put on my feet!!!,BEZ21
5,10/24/2017,"Everyone stop what you're doing and listen to me Great shoes! Comfort, fit, looks are all A+!!!!!!!",BEZ21
5,10/16/2017,"replacement for glide 8 was looking for a replacement for the Glide 8, and thought it was the Supernova, however have found this is much more similar to Glide 8 in terms of design, however the stretch mesh upper is an improvement.",BEZ21
5,10/15/2017,"Excellent product extremely comfortable, great for hiking! Padded heel makes this shoe great.",BEZ21
5,10/10/2017,Look great Bought as a present to replace a previous pair. The recipient loves them for running and says the cage gives good support. Light and stylish.,BEZ21

I would have given them a prefect score but because of this I didn't,BEZ21
5,10/03/2017,my 3rd pair. Love them. Love this shoe. Wouldn't buy anything else. They are the perfect fit.,BEZ21
5,10/01/2017,"The only training shoe I will wear I don't know why anyone would wear any other training shoe. These are THE BEST trainer on the market. I get 2-3 times the mileage out of these shoes than any other shoe. They are insanely comfortable but lightweight and responsive at the same time. As light as a tempo shoe but with 3x's the comfort and cushioning. My injury rates have gone way down since I started wearing the Adidas Energy Boost about 5 years ago. I will not wear any other trainer. The quality, durability, comfort, and performance make these shoes the best trainer on the market.",BEZ21
4,09/16/2017,Great training shoe for mid week and weekend long and easy runs. Great fit and ready to go straight out of the box. I really enjoy this model and rotate them with my Boston boost models to mix it up through a training week. They offer a nice cushion feel when you have been training hard and on weeks when you are building up distance they help me to avoid those un wanted niggles. I use them on roads and trails and on park runs. Cushion with speed and feel !,BEZ21
5,09/13/2017,"Love these soles!! I bought these for my dad after having bought the ultra boost for myself and loving how comfortable they are. Adidas are slightly narrow so I'd recommend buying half a size bigger than you normally are. These are the best trainers I've had, and as a none runner, they served me perfectly as getting me through the Great North Run 2017 without any discomfort, injuries or blisters. So excited to buy my next pair...this time for me of course!! ;)",BEZ21
5,09/12/2017,"Stunning Just up graded from the Energy Boost 3 to the new 2017 edition, they are a stunning looking shoe, seem slightly wider at the front which is a bonus and I know the run boost quality will pay off. I opted for these over the ultra boost model, far better stability in my opinion. And the added continental sole too.",BEZ21
5,09/10/2017,greatest running shoe on the planet!!!!!! the energy return is absolutely the best!!!  like no shoe i've ever worn and i've been doing this for more than 30 years,BEZ21
1,09/09/2017,"Painful I bought these as the original runner. Very disappointing that I took them to an indoor track and just about immediately started getting pain on the outside of my feet. Made it only about a mile and had to STOP. At home now cleaning and will have to PAY to ship back. My Vomeros are still head and shoulders above these in every aspect aside from maybe the upper material but not by much.

Wish they would have worked out because the look is great. No way no how are they a $160 runner however.",BEZ21
5,09/09/2017," it's really perfect. for those who are doing running exercise they will love it, once they try it.",BEZ21
5,09/05/2017,Quality well designed trainer. Slightly narrow Another Adidas quality product. Slightly narrow though,BEZ21
5,09/03/2017, Very comfortable and great quality!  I'm very pleased with these shoes!  They are a cool style!,BEZ21
5,08/29/2017,"Energy Boost Believer These are about my 5th or 6th pair of Energy Boost (I've lost count now). I've tried some others and have kept coming back to these. For my feet, these are a perfect fit. I personally like the fit like a sock feel ... less slipping, minimal to no blisters, and since I'm a habitual heel striker - the feel of my foot hitting the pavement is minimal which decreases my foot pain after a long run. The only knock I've had is the the wear on the sole is quick ... though with this latest pair, I see they've stepped up the game in that area with the improved Continental rubber. We shall see, but so far, so good ... as usual.",BEZ21
5,08/25/2017, The design of the shoes is a great match for how comfortable it feels on my daily run.,BEZ21
5,08/20/2017,"Was hesitant, but iam satisfied I purchase them! Adidas what did you do with this version, totally better than boost 3, the width is awesome my toes can breath! I ran 5 miles in them just to see the difference, big difference, don't change anything up!",BEZ21
5,08/18/2017, Comfortable and stylish. First day I wore them for 11 hours. Great running shoe.,BEZ21

2,08/12/2017,"Serious forefoot runners; avoid buying! I've used and been very satisfied with the former version Adidas Energy boost 3, which Ive had 3 pairs of in the past year. This new model is simply not as good as expected  according to advertisement. For a forefoot runner as I, the shoes cushioning were simply too soft making it feel like running in the sand. The boost, energy or extra kick they advertise about were simply not there. suddenly i ran 10 seconds slower per kilometer with these shoes. I wont recommend these shoes to anything else than recovery runs or fashion. P.s. the forefoot are a bit too wide which forced me to buy half a size smaller than energy boost 3. The shoes were comfortable - feeling like wearing socks.",BEZ21

4,08/10/2017,"Energy Boosts are soft, comfortable and functional. Energy Boosts are similar to the way Ultra Boosts are, although I find them less stylish compared to the Ultra Boosts.

2,10/15/2017,Not what I payed for The size the width the comfort was perfect but the stitching on the side was loose. Definitely what you don’t want to see when you pay iver $200 for a pair of sneakers. Was so disappointed on that little detail decided not to exchange them for a new pair. The color is beautiful.,DWE90
5,10/14/2017,"Love these shoes This product was a great purchase, super comfortable and super cute.",DWE90
5,10/13/2017,"Favorite sneakers by a long shot I love this shoe. I have two pairs, and they're the most comfortable sneakers I own. The upper is soft and breathable, and the boost is as comfortable as ever. My mom has a lot of foot pain, and she wears these, too. They're amazing!",DWE90

2,09/23/2017,"Worst RUNNING shoes I've ever worn! Bought these pair (Stella McCartney Ultraboost X Green) after reading ultraboost uncaged reviews. I thought they should be as comfortable. These are the worst shoes I've ever worn for running! I've run a half marathon in my cheap adidas coudfoam and I thought I was getting an upgrade in comfort with these shoes. I was mistaken. My feet were already hurting the first 20 minutes of running. Tried them again for another 4 mile run , then a 6 mile, then another 5 mile but my feet never adjusted to them. They just kept hurting my feet. I still love the design so I'll just use them for running errands. I'm still searching for the best pair of running shoes and have not given up on Adidas. I've tried Asics, Brooks, Nike, Saucony, Hoka, Under Armour for running and still keep going back to my ever comfortable Adidas Cloudfoam I bought for 40$ at Adidas Outlet store. Hope I find the right pair of Adidas before my next two half marathons which are scheduled this December and January.",DWE90
4,09/16/2017,"A little pricey but good quality n stylish It's comfortable and trendy at the same time, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice trainers",DWE90
4,09/16/2017,Great shoe but too small Great shoe but because of the sole design your foot slides forward and makes the show too small. I would go up a half size. otherwise they are amazing.,DWE90
5,09/10/2017, I have a torn achilles tendon and these shoes are super comfortable for me to walk in.,DWE90
4,09/07/2017,Great purchases. Love these sneakers ! I bought them originally as an everyday wear but wore them on the treadmill when I was on a business trip and really fell in love . They did bother my arch after a few hours but I do have a high arch,DWE90
3,09/04/2017,"UNDERWHELMING I ordered them in my size, but they were very tight, especially around the midfoot. The boost material feels nowhere near as groundbreaking as the hype had me believe. It felt like the shoe interrupts blood circulation when my feet are at rest. The reinforced toe pushed against my toenails uncomfortably, and when I took it out for a test run its performance was underwhelming. It’s a nice looking shoe but the shape is not for me, and I will be returning them. Maybe my expectations for its comfort were too high, but then again I did pay 170 pounds for it. Overall, so-and-so.",DWE90
5,08/29/2017,"They are gorgeous They rate beautifully made and look amazing on. I'm normally a 4.5 but these were slightly tight on one foot. After a bit of wear it was fine. I want them in every colour, so comfy! Thank you Stella!",DWE90
1,08/28/2017,"Shoe hurts, really bad design Of so many running shoes I own, sadly, this is the only pair that hurts my foot. The design is poor. The back of the shoe is curves up which is basically an unnecessary design flaw. The back isnt leather or some soft cushiony back you can break in too, but basically elastic rubber band material. It really dug into my foot and the only way to remedy it is to wear socks tall enough that go past the back of the shoe to cushion between the shoe and the skin. However, this means sacrificing style. Really disappointed and will not recommend this.",DWE90
1,08/22/2017,"Came with a hole in the knit, no response from Adidas My true size is an 8, but it's a bit snug. The first couple of times I wore it my feet felt sore, like I lost circulation. But my biggest complaint is that there is a thread loose + the stitching is not as tight on the ankle, resulting in a hole. I've called and emailed Adidas but have not received a response, and am not happy with the lack of customer service.",DWE90
5,08/20/2017,"Comfortable I'm size 9, fit perfect, very comfy for everyday and for running. I bought 2 pairs.",DWE90

5,08/04/2017,LOVE THESE SHOES! These are SO cute and SO comfy. Best running shoes I've tried so far! Sizing is pretty true to size. I was only sad to see the threading unraveling on the side on one of the shoes when I opened them... besides that I'm in love!!,DWE90
5,08/04/2017,"Ultra amazing! Uncaged Ultraboost wasn't the highest on my list in choices to wear when compared to regular ultraboosts but the women's Stella McCartney Ultraboost is amazing. 

I love the way it fits snugly around my foot and it feels like it's meant to fit my foot perfectly.  It supports me perfectly at my arches while still feeling light and breathable. 

When running with them I feel light and supported and get really great traction on ground. 

Long periods of wear it does start to feel little hot and too suffocating at times but overall I highly recommend them. They feel like you're standing on clouds.",DWE90
5,08/03/2017,Doing good for the environment I love that these are made from recycled ocean plastics which means this purchase helped the environment.

5,06/11/2017,"The shoes for every occassions Love this shoes to the max. Had the previous colour (black n white) and definitely getting them in every colour available! Very comfortable for running, weight and functional training. Pretty tight when you first wear them (but not to the point where it is uncomfortable), but they really hugged and moulded to your feet after 1-2 weeks daily wear.",DWE90
5,10/28/2017,"creativity my new vehicle preparing for winter, i try it with 8k run yesterday , my pace was slightly better than last time , but this is my notes :
1-SUPERB STABILITY.
2-WATER-REPELLENT.
3-BREATHABLE PROTECTION.
4-COMPLETE COMFORT TO THE SOLES OF THE FOOT & HEEL & ANKLE.
5-THE OUTSOLE IS MUCH THICKER THAN ANY OTHER ULTRA BOOST SHOES , { that mean Longer life during contact with the ground }.
i thought it's too expensive but after i test it i can say it deserve every penny.",DWF45
1,10/21/2017,Horrible Quality The shoe ripped within 1 week i was very unsatisfied I really think you should get these at least half a size up or it will rip like mine did.,DWF45

5,11/27/2017,"Great shoes in a unique colourway Very comfortable shoes. Good cushioning but also good support. Heel counter grips my foot nicely and there is a pronounced forefoot rocker to aid during toe-off. The liner of this Reigning Champ version is leather lined so it feels really nice. The fit is a little large, similar to my Sequence Boost and NMD R2's, so I ordered down in size.",CDM88

4,11/16/2017,"Nice shoe aesthetics, comfortable, everyday wear. I find the shoe fits 1/2 size larger than my true size. Like the aesthetics and comfortability of this shoe, but not as comfortable (much firmer) as the ultraboost I'm used to. Perfect for everyday casual wear.",CDM88
5,11/06/2017,"Impressed so far. I don't use these for running, but I work on my feet walking around for 9 hours a day and these are great.
A bit more narrow feeling than my Ultraboosts, and the mesh is definitely more snug, and not as stretchy as the primeknit, but It still feels great.
The name is perfect as the midsoul is more firm, but gives you this bounce feeling that sort of propels you forward.
Would recommend, especially if you can pick a pair up on sale.",CDM88
4,09/29/2017,Very comfy shoes Its very comfy and good for outdoor running. Recommended,CDM88

1,06/10/2017,"Runners were defective, refunded and new pair is great. I think I had a defective pair of runners. I've been running/walking in Adidas for 25 years and never had a problem. This pair of runners had me shifting my gait to my instep and caused foot pain. To Adidas credit, I was easily able to return the shoes and get a different runner. Very happy now.",CDM88
5,06/08/2017,Go adidas I love how the shoe wraps around my foot and it's not strangling me. It gives great support for my flat feet,CDM88
5,06/06/2017," The shoe fits well, looks great and was a good buy.",CDM88
5,06/06/2017,Very satisfied sneakerhead. Awesome materials. Had to go down a .5 size at least though. They do run a little big. Premium leather accents are great. Price increase is the only draw back for this specific pair.,CDM88
5,05/31/2017, Great colorway. Looks amazing on feet. I recommend to go half size down,CDM88
5,05/26/2017,"I'm very happy with this purchase. They look even better in person, wearing them all the time!",CDM88
4,05/19/2017,"Good looks but unstable Great looking pair of shoes. Very comfortable, slightly narrow, although the upper material stretches to negate this issue. I do not suggest using these shoes at the gym, as the tread change on the makes  for an unbalanced shoe. You will notice this as soon as you put them on. They seem OK for running...  but I have not tried this as this is mostly an athleisure shoe.",CDM88
4,05/13/2017, Shoe runs half size larger. Overall decent quality,CDM88
5,05/01/2017," - 0.5 size down at least, they are long in fit and appearance. They feel snug width wise for me, but it breaks in. 

- Wasn't sure how gray they were, it's a very light gray. I consider them more off white than gray.

- They WILL develop creases across the toe box. Most shoes do, but these will be slightly more noticeable though.

- Feels average in weight and breathability. They are not as light as primeknit etc. 

- Quality of construction is better than average, and on the higher tier of adidas shoes.

- Walking and running it feels very good!

Mine came with the left shoe having a orange glue stain which is hard to remove. Also it seemed tried on where certain parts had creasing and felt worn.

Otherwise, great looking shoes. I prefer ultraboost over these, but for the value it's great.",CDM88
5,04/29/2017,"Very underrated, comfortable, and stylish. The shoe uses top quality materials for the price.",CDM88

5,04/14/2017,"Best shoe in the adidas tech family. The best value shoe that exists on the market. The upper creases near the toe box after about 10-15 wears, but it isn't PK so what more can you ask for? Bounce cushioning is far superior to boost in terms of long term comfort or all day wear. If you are a hypebeast who works on your feet, you just found your ideal everyday shoe. Looks amazing with jeans and sweats and performs at the level of a high end performance shoe. If you wear Ultra Boosts BEWARE, these fit a FULL size down from the Ultra boost. If you are a 10 in UB, order 9 in these.",CDM88

5,09/16/2017,"Order a 1/2 Size Up! First off, please save yourself some time and hassle by ordering a 1/2 size up. My true size is 11.5, ordered 11.5, it was too small. Adidas was great in refunding my purchase, from there ordered a size 12... Perfect!! 
Second, this shoe is insanely comfortable. Yes, they are expensive. Are they worth it? Absolutely. 
Lastly, the looks of this shoe are so unique from all others. I've only worn them a handful of times out so far and it seems I always get compliments on them! Thanks Adidas!",CDT36
4,09/11/2017,"Coolest running shoe I've seen yet, but there is not enough height in the toe box. Terribly disappointed. The length and width were great. I wish there was a little more height in the toe box. I love the shoes, but the material is too thick and rubs the top of the toes. Increase that height and I'll buy a few pair.",CDT36
3,09/06/2017,Do not like heel Lovely quality but i do not like the overhang on the heel,CDT36
4,09/01/2017,"Very comfy, clean looking trainer. My overall opinion of the PUREBOOST was that the comfort was similar to that of the primknit NMD r1. However, I'd recommend purchasing half a size larger as it was slightly too narrow and was therefore tight on foot. This does stretch the more you wear it though.",CDT36

5,12/05/2017,"Amazing purchase These shoes are amazing! Ordered a whole size down because that’s what they had left (Usually a 10 and got a 9) and they are perfect. I would recommend sizing down depending on how wide your feet are 0.5 to a whole size cause they rub large. Support is impeccable, comfortable to wear for the gym or running around campus. All around a good purchase.",CDT50

1,09/27/2017,"Very poor quality! I am a HUGE Ultra Boost shoes fan. I’ve never had anything negative to say – they’re beautiful, comfortable and great quality (at least I thought so). I’ve purchased 4 different colors/versions over the past two years but I’ve never purchased a Parley shoe until now. It’s VERY evident that Adidas sacrificed quality for looks on these. Within just a few wears, the heel/back of my shoes were completed RIPPED. I’ve never had this issue with the regular Ultra Boosts… The inner lining is made out of a different material on the Parley models, which feels weaker and much thinner than the regular models. Now I can’t even wear my Parleys because all they do is give me blisters… 
If you love shoes that you can actually wear more than 10 times, stay away from these…",EFT54
5,09/24/2017,"One of the best collabs These shoes are amazing, I can't even start to describe how comfortable they are!",EFT54

I am very satisfied with the build quality of these running shoes. The material are of good quality. Really there isn't anything wrong with these shoes. 

Although, I chose not to recommend this product. Only because, If you are a new runner, I firmly believe you should seek help from a professional on which types of shoes benefit your feet. Usually you can find help in a sports store/shoe store.

I run a lot of half marathons and some full (mostly on trails), and my feet would hurt really bad afterwards from the rough terrain until I tried the UltraBoost. Shoe truelly absorbs the impact from the rough terrains. This is my third pair and already looking forward to my next one. Also, the online shopping experience was first class.

All I have ever wanted in a shoe was the equivalent of two pillows to bolt on my feet. Historically though, my heal strike would go right through the cushion of a soft shoe which was harder on my body than the harder mid soles. These are by far the softest shoe I have used that I don't crash through the padding. I am only running on dirt and caliche so cannot rate them on pavement. They are replacing my older ultra boost. They are softer than the old shoe but the fact that the old shoes held up so well encourages me as to if they will last.

As w all of the ultra boost I have owned, they will suck the sock off your foot if the sock is any thing but a tight fit because the heel fits loose",BEZ74

5,11/29/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I own I went to Vegas just a few days ago, and I copped a pair of these when i was black Friday shopping. Best decision ever! Got these for 120 bucks and they are holding up great. true to size and very comfortable. Boost is obviously very comfortable and makes you feel like walking on fluff. I recommend people wanting to buy this shoe because it's just a great deal for a shoe like this( retail too!) It's a great gym shoe, running shoe, walking shoe, and workout shoe, again, best boost shoe made by Adidas so far, and i recommend you buying it.",FBN57
5,11/28/2017,Amazing shoe but expensive. This is probably one of the comfiest shoes ive ever worn and i am a sneaker head. However the price seems to be increasing all the time and im beginning to think that £150 is too much for these.,FBN57
5,11/27/2017,"Love, love, love, love, love If I could, I'd wear these everyday. These are the most comfortable and also very stylish.  I picked up the black, grey & white upper with black colored boost sole get and constant compliments. I did go down a 1/2 size from my Energy Boost 1 and 2s, which was perfect. I wanted a snugger fit, since these are uncaged.",FBN57
5,11/26/2017,"Lucky deal on a great pair of expensive shoes I got a great Black Friday deal at Champ’s Sports (in-store) and got the grey colorway of these shoes for $120. I probably would not have paid the retail $180, though, because I simply don’t have the money to get a $180 pair of shoes. The most I would pay is probably $150. I am not saying these shoes aren’t worth the money, I’m just saying I don’t have that much. I got lucky, and if you get an oppurtunity to
purchase these for less than retail, DO IT.",FBN57

5,11/19/2017,"Best Adidas Shoe I have the Yeezy 350, iniki, alphabounce, ultraboost 3.0, and these are the best shoe I’ve tried! They are way comfortable and it seriously feels like wearing a sock with boost glued to the bottom.

4,10/22/2017,"Good for running Good quality, and excellent for running in the morning.",FBN57
5,10/21/2017,Perfect fit! After only able to see these online i was a little worried I wasn't going to be able to fit my orthotics. Once I received them I was quite surprised with the ample room. These uncaged runners are not only great looking but fit perfectly and extremely comfortable.,FBN57
5,10/16/2017,Amazing shoe!! Super comfortable and true to size. Great shoe and so glad they became available. I would definitely recommend  them.,FBN57

4,10/12/2017,"Very Comfortable! Got myself a pair of the Ultra Boosts on release day. The shoe fits snugly as a glove... A tad tight, so try your regular size, or a half-size up if you prefer a looser fit.
The shoes are light, and the knit material is ventilated well so that you don't feel overheated.",FBN57

The 100% knit upper gives the mopst amazing feel to a shoe I have ever had. There is zero resistance in any angle of movement, yet the upper does control your foot well. The boost sole moves nicely with your foot as well, you never feel like you are fighting the shoe. I did my first run in them and immediately ordered a second pair to put into roation.",FBN57

2,09/18/2017,Comfortability not comfortable for the price I paid. They look better on the site versus in person,FBN57
2,09/17/2017,"Don't wear them very often. If you're planning to wear these with no-shows/with shorts, think again. They look pretty terrible if you don't have long pants on due to the cuff squeezing your ankle. They're pretty comfortable, I expected more from the boost but they're good for running in straight lines. If you're wanting to do something turn-intensive (e.g. basketball,) think again. These shoes have no horizontal support and, when quickly turning, the sole will slip out from under your foot due to the stretchy primeknit on the side. The boost wears pretty easily and looks kinda nasty, but other than that, they've held up pretty well. No frays or anything on the primeknit, which is nice.",FBN57
5,09/12/2017,I've never seen one like the Ultraboost uncaged The product becomes part of your body and I think it's great.,FBN57
5,09/12/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Fits very well, although I'd size up if you have wide feet. Other than that, the PK feels fantastic around my feet, and the Boost provides an ample amount of cushioning. I'd recommend buying even  if no coupon/promotion is available.",FBN57
5,09/07/2017,Very comfortable They are very stylish. I really liked much cushion they have on the inside.,FBN57
5,08/24/2017,"Never loved a shoe as well as these. Anyone complaining about size being to small, take the insole out and allow your foot to relax on the boost material which will also be giving you that little extra bit of room you're needing! Great purchase.",FBN57
5,08/18/2017,"Didn't  Suit me nice trainers. Look nice online. In fact when I saw a collegue wearing them.......I was sold. However, when I got them, they were comfortable, however, they just didn't suit me. Could not justify spending $180 on pair of trainers that just looked fair on me.",FBN57
4,08/16/2017, The Uncaged Ultra boost are a little tight when I received them hope they will relax and loosen up a little.,FBN57
5,08/14/2017,"Best shoes I own. These are great. Comfortable, quality built and look clean. I went half a size down personally. I'll definitely be buying some UB 4.0s when they come out, personally not a fan of the 3.0 cages.",FBN57
5,08/14/2017,Great shoes These are fantastic shoes. i wear them all day and my feet won't hurt. i would not use these for running because the cushion in my opinion is not enough but for walking and everyday use as well as the gym they are perfect and look amazing,FBN57

5,08/10/2017,Extremely comfortable These are awesome shoes - super comfortable. Might not be the best choice if you have a particularly wide food - I don't have a wide foot and these really hug your feet. I ordered my typical gym shoe size and it was spot on. I'm really happy with this purchase. Might get another pair!,FBN57
1,08/09/2017,Never buy it again it killing my feet. I only put them on I didn't like the shoes cause it hurt my feet really bad everytime I put them on it is not even 5 minutes my feet start to killing me because of rubber is really tie.,FBN57

4,07/18/2017,"Amazing shoes The shoes were tight at first but are really comfortable, I would recommend buying thin mid cut socks with these shoes.",FBN57
5,07/15/2017,"Great product, can't wait to get 3.0. Amazing quality shoe, super comfortable, and I personally love the socklike look of it, also you may be fine going down a half size",FBN57
4,07/13/2017,"Highly recommend It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, but the stitches cam out on the toe",FBN57
5,07/10/2017,"Wow. Amazing shoe and worth the price This is a review of the adidas Ultra boost uncaged 2.0.

The primary difference between the uncaged 1.0 and 2.0 is the 3D-printed heel cup and the introduction of some fresh new colorways.

I went to the adidas Employee Store in Portland and they (unfortunately) didn't have any ultraboost uncaged shoes in my size. I was able to purchase the last pair (size 9) at a footlocker.

In terms of fit, I'd go true-to-size. If you aren't too fond of a snug fit, going a half-size up is an option. You can really feel the boost in every step you take and the continental rubber tread has durability that is comparable to that of an overbaked cookie - no matter what you do to it, it just won't break.

In-person, the primeknit of the core black/grey colorway looks like a slightly darker version of the NMD_R1 Firestarter's primeknit. The laces look as if there was a tinge of purple applied to them as they are not the same shade as the primeknit upper.

Other than that, the Ultra boost uncaged 2.0 is a really nice shoe that I would most definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a lifestyle shoe that can also be used for athletics.

Great job adidas and keep the amazing products coming :)",FBN57
2,07/09/2017,Would not Recommend The shoe is comfortable and light but the stitches came off the front of the shoe. Very disappointed,FBN57
5,07/08/2017,good purchase the shoe is tight in the beginning but gets more comfy,FBN57
2,07/07/2017,"Would not buy again. The shoe is comfortable, i love the feel of primknit, its not a bad shoe if you only to travel in a forward direction, they have no side support in the boost sole. the shoe has buckled sideways on me several times. The rubber sole is possibly too thin, it broke down in only a few weeks wear, leaving the boost midsole to crack and separate quickly. :( not happy with these especially for this high of a price.",FBN57

5,09/28/2017,"Very comfortable shoe These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They are very tight on your foot, and they aren't kidding when they say bounce. They are very cushioned when you walk or run. I have only had them for a week and some glue seems to be coming off, but I hope that its just some extra glue or something, and that they won't be falling apart anytime soon. They are also very nice looking, but they don't reflect as much as I expected them to.",BDZ60

I do wear the same type of socks which I change daily.,FBL99

5,12/02/2017,Super comfy and get compliments all the time. I bought these as I have 2 others in different colors. Black is a staple for my wardrobe. These shoes make my large size 9.5 feet appear smaller. The wide laces are different and unique.,KDO46

5,12/01/2017,Great shoe! I always size down a half size with ADIDAS as they tend to run big. Thesee were a little narrow at first but after about an hour stretched to comfort.,KDO46
5,12/01/2017,"VERY COMFY SHOES!! They're pretty light! good to go the gym. wouldn't use them to run long distances because they're not as flexible. (I think they're good for a 5k tho), but overall I love them and they look VERY nice with any outfit.",KDO46
5,11/30/2017,Adidas are the best!!! Everything is always stylish and comfortable/great,KDO46
3,11/29/2017,"Honestly could have been better. The good side to this shoe is that it’s very light weight so it doesn’t get too uncomfortable. The reason why I reated this a 3 is because the botoms of the shoe are not very flexible. Because of that, once your foot hits the ground, its more like a thump. Everytime I go jogging whether its on the tredmill of outside, its just *thump thump thump*. They’re also very flat. I could wear these shoes like trainers. Running shoes are suppose to make you feel like you don’t have shoes on. This shoe makes sure you do.",KDO46
5,11/29/2017,"Worst Running shoe I put 5 stars so everyone can read. This is not a great shoe for a serious runner. The sock design seems cool, but if you run hard the laces will dig in to the top of your foot. If you had to buy them they would only be cool looking shoes that you can wear for light walking. They don't even have the support in the top to be a training shoe. Not for any serious workouts.",KDO46
5,11/28/2017,"So comfortable I liked because is so comfortable, i really love them",KDO46
4,11/28/2017,"Runs a bit small Super cute shoes, which make my feet look very small. I have not walked out with them on but so far, theyre pretty comfy. I normally wear a 6.5 so I ordered such. However at the bridge of my feet it is on the tighter side so it hurts a bit when I leave my feet in for too long. I have a higher foot arch so that may be why. I got the black ones and they look fantastic.",KDO46
5,11/22/2017,"Obsessed with these shoes!! I am so in love with these shoes!! They are beyond comfortable offering good arch support and comfort. 
I have a bunion on one foot and because the shoes are stretchy in that area it makes them unbelievably comfortable for me. I usually wear an 8 1/2 in tennis shoes but sized down to an 8 and they fit perfect with a thin sock. These are my new go to shoe!!",KDO46
5,08/26/2017,Lightweight and comfy One of my favorite purchases from Adidas. Super lightweight and comfy!,KDO46
5,08/14/2017,"Awesome!!! Super light, comfy and quality shoes! I cannot describe how comfortable they are. A little bit too big but it does not matter. They are stretchy so they adapt to your feet while you're walking. Easy to put on and I loooooove how they look.",KDO46
5,08/07/2017,Excellent trainers Very comfortable and a beautiful colour. Love the fat laces! Ordered half a size larger than usual because I have custom made orthotics to squeeze in and they fit perfectly. So lightweight and comfortable - happy feet!,KDO46
3,07/26/2017,Decent shoe Quality is great. I get tons of compliments on the shoes! but they are a little too narrow. They make my feet tired after running. They are more of a training shoe. I don't like to walk in them too long. Overall good shoe just not for running as I intended the shoe to be.,KDO46

4,03/25/2017," It has a nice design and colour, though when I checked the sides, it seems like the soles are poorly sticked to the shoes. We'll see how long these shoes will last. Nonetheless, they're great and comfortable.",KDO46

4,02/16/2017," Liked the baby pink colour, they were very light weight but sent back as wasn't too keen on the material and you can see your toes through them. Were very comfortable though. Think they'd be better in darker colour for me personally.",KDO46
5,02/15/2017,Great looking trainer! Very comfortable good looking trainer. Went for a size bigger and glad I did as they fit perfectly.,KDO46
4,02/15/2017,Comfortable and reasonable price Soft and comfortable. The sole is suitable for wide feet. Sock-like feel although I could see the shape of my toes pretty clearly..,KDO46
4,02/13/2017,Really good trainers! I was a bit unsure of these trainers when I first put them on as the edges hurt my feet a little but as soon as I stood up they felt perfect. I do lots of running on a treadmill and these trainers have the right amount of cushion in them to support my feet. You can see the outline of your toes which is the only negative for me. Overall I am happy with them.,KDO46
5,02/10/2017,The best trainers I had ever. Very comfortable and good quality! Bought them for cardio.  Was best choice ever,KDO46
5,02/08/2017, I like the style of the lace. It is unique. Up your size by half. Lucky I have small and narrow feet. B actually the front will expand base on your feet wide.,KDO46

4,02/06/2017,"Great all round gym shoe. I went up a half size and they fit perfectly. The canvas on the front of the shoe is very thin, but means you feet stay cool. Very comfortable to wear in the gym",KDO46
4,02/05/2017,A stylish but comfortable shoe. These shoes were really comfortable. Not sure about the thick laces but glad i was given another pair of thin ones. Even though they are a little narrow they are still a comfortable shoe.,KDO46
4,01/31/2017,"Pretty good trainers I love the fabric and laces they pinch a bit after several hours of wear, but I'm hoping this will settle down.",KDO46
5,01/23/2017,Perfect purchase Very Comfortable for jogging and very light in weight,KDO46
5,01/21/2017,"Comfiest trainers ever Comfiest trainers I've ever worn great for running, plyometrics and stylish enough to wear with jeans I've worn them all day and walked miles in them with no problems at all I bought another pair and would buy more but there out of stock at the moment",KDO46

5,01/11/2017,"The perfect shoe FOR WOMEN! There is nothing feminine about this shoe. It fits well, its a slim fit. Great for gents with wide feet. The sole IS BLACK. Unlike most of Adidas's clown like colour designs (which I may add look like 12 year olds choose the colour combinations) and to top it off they go perfect with jeans. No strange proportions from the sides and from the front they are sleek. You can find something like this elsewhere BUT NOT with this leading edge technology. Its not rocketscience Adidas, how about you make this unisex, or release a version for males? We always miss out on your most elegant shoe designs.",KDO46
5,01/07/2017,"Good buy Love these shoes, bought them in pink and the look just look just like the picture except the tongue of the shoe comes higher up than what it looks like in the picture, but I really like it. You can see the outline of your toes through them but it isn't noticeable and doesn't bother me.",KDO46
5,12/30/2016," Bought these shoes to take some aerobics classes but they are so comfortable, I wear them all the time outside of the gym!",KDO46
4,12/28/2016,"Can't wear it anymore :( the shoe is beautiful and super comfortable. I own a lot of sneakers, but this is the most comfortable. The only thing is that after wearing them about 3 times he front part where the sole meets the tip of the shoe came unglued. I was so disappointed. I wrote to Adidas customer service and they said that I could return it. I planned on doing that but my mother already tried to help and glue it back on. It doesn't look good. I'm so sad because I loved these shoes.",KDO46
5,12/28/2016, Perfect size and exactly what I ordered thanks adidas,KDO46
5,12/19/2016,I want more but every color keeps selling out! Best sneakers ever. Biggest issue is that they keep selling out before I get to order more. Please help Adidas!!,KDO46

3,12/14/2016,"could have done better Nice colour but your toes show at the top, not a fan of that, makes it look a little ugly as your little toe sticks out of the side.",KDO46

4,12/07/2016,"The most comfortable shoe! My 1st material shoe, right one ripped on the side",KDO46
4,12/07/2016,Ok. Popping noise is bad I love the style of this shoe and they are comfortable. I have had my pair for just about 3 weeks now. All of a sudden today I am walking and the left shoe starts making a popping noise under my toes. So annoying. I cannot find anything that is causing the popping. At first I thought it was something sticky but nothing on the soles. Very irritating.,KDO46

3,11/23/2016,"Nice casual shoes, poor exercise/running shoes Not great as running shoes because the material is too thin to provide stability toward the forefoot. 
I would recommend this shoe for casual wear as it is comfortable, but I would not recommend running or exercise in these.",KDO46

5,11/07/2016, I feel like I could have had a half size smaller but love them and wear them all the time. Love how light they are.,KDO46
5,11/06/2016,Best workout shoe ever! They do run big. I ordered a half size smaller. Very comfortable. First pair that my feet do not hurt. Easy to clean bc the top is cloth.,KDO46
5,11/06/2016,"Love these sneakers. Usually I'm a half size larger in running shoes, so I ordered a half size up, but they were too big. I exchanged them for my actual size and they fit perfectly. They're so comfortable and great for running or just daily life. Super cool looking to boot!",KDO46
5,11/05/2016, It's like walking or running on air. True to size. Sleek look.,KDO46
4,11/05/2016,Runs small Definitely too small to wear with socks and I'm always the same size in shoes. I also have a very high arch and it's very difficult to get these on- maybe easier if I sized up.,KDO46
5,11/04/2016,"Great trainers, wear them all the time in the gym Very comfortable but toes can poke through the fabric! Great for gym work rather than outdoor running/sport",KDO46
5,11/02/2016,"Lucky I got my size early! Really love the style, colour and they are so comfortable!",KDO46
5,11/02/2016,"Favorite adidas shoes bought yet! Love, love, love these shoes! I bought them in white and get tons of compliments every time I wear them! Super comfortable, and so versatile. You can wear them with joggers or jeans. Was hesitant to buy in white at first but as they got dirty I threw them in the washing machine and bc of the primeknit material they came out great and look new again!! Very happy with my purchase. Please don't discontinue! Trying to decide what color to get next!",KDO46
5,11/01/2016,Buying at least two more pairs The fit is super comfortable! Love the top fit! Love how the top of the shoe fits around my ankle,KDO46

5,11/01/2016,Awesome shoes! These shoes are so SO comfortable!  The material that covers your toes is a little thin (you can kind of see the tip of my big toe) but once they are broken in I'm sure they'll be fine!  Love these! So light weight and comfortable!,KDO46

4,10/28/2016,"Looks great! Feels even better :) I adore these shoes! Aesthetically gorgeous and true to size! I absolutely love the fit and support you get with it. The lux is very lightweight and comfortable. They also dry fast due to the material used on the the top casing your foot. However this stretchy/cloth/socklike material can be very delicate if snagged on something. I've only had mine two weeks, worn them to Disneyland and had to problems. But I fell down when I was running and gained a hole close to the laces of the shoe. I would recommend them, just keep a close eye on what you do in them!",KDO46
5,10/28/2016,"Should have gotten a size bigger, too tight Yes, the look of the shoe is awesome. Deff purchase your size.",KDO46

4,10/26/2016, Always get tons of compliments and so comfortable. Only complaint is that the fabric around the laces is starting to peel back after only a few months could probably be glued but expected them to hold up better.,KDO46
5,10/25/2016,"Super comfy shoes! These are very comfortable! Definitely recommend! I would have preferred black on black for the logo, however.",KDO46
5,10/25/2016,"Light Superfly Shoes :) These shoes are extremely lightweight, but this does not take away from how comfortable they are. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is on their feet for long periods of time.",KDO46

5,10/22/2016,I love them. These are my babies I love them so much. They are so cute and comfortable. Very squishy bottom. I feel weird with the top because my big toe kind of pokes out the top since it is just like a fabric piece over the top without structure but I don't care they're so fleek.,KDO46
5,10/22/2016,I live this walking shoes...super love it.. It's good for walking .the clothing is soft which makes it comfortable,KDO46

5,10/22/2016,Good Out of the 3 pairs I got from adidas the best ones are these,KDO46
4,10/22/2016,"Good purchase. I really loved the shoes! My only comment was the fabric over the toes. It's pretty thin. You can wiggle your toes if you're able to see them move. Other than, they're great.",KDO46
5,10/21/2016, The shoes are comfortable and stylish. Have gotten so many complements!!,KDO46
2,10/21/2016,"Comfortable and stylish but hole within one month This was my first Adidas purchase for myself and I was very excited to find a stylish running shoe that could handle my large bunions. The wider mesh and seam-free toe box were the selling points. I managed to wear them one month before a hole developed in the right bunion area. The sole as well also started wearing down in the heel area. Please note that I wear these for running for 30 minutes or walking now and then. Very disappointing quality. Yes, my large bunions may cause more stress to the fabric but a hole within one month is inexcusable low quality.",KDO46
5,10/21/2016,"Love the look and color, Great style, I want every color, really comfortable",KDO46
5,10/20/2016,Love they have black bottoms to match the top Love that the black tops have black bottoms. It is so hard to find a nice pair of black sneakers that have the matching black soles. They look wonderful on with a totally black outfit. And most of the models have the black soles when they are showing that Adidas style. Thank you. Please make the traditional leather 3 stripe available with the black soles as well (with the white 3 stripes),KDO46
4,10/20/2016, Love the way the shoe looks although runs slightly big,KDO46
5,10/19/2016,Awesome buy Very comfortable and good for physical activities.,KDO46
5,10/19/2016,"Best purchase ever.! These shoes are the closest thing to perfection. They are sooo comfortable and sooo nice. When I saw them online I was instantly attracted to the style of these shoes but when I received them, I fell in love. The style is sooo unique. I've never had that kind on stretch material on a shoe before but that's what makes them soo comfy. This material literally hugs your feet.! These are perfect if you walk a lot or if you're constantly standing. I workout a lot so I'm always soar and these shoes help me walk without any discomfort. I wouldn't recommend them to work out because of the material the shoe is made of but I would definitely use them for everything else. The comfort level on this show is hard to explain but I was soo obsessed that I bought them in black as well. I ordered these shoes in a size 8 because that's my size most of the time but they fit me big so I got 7.5. So I would size them down half a size. Another thing about this shoe is that it is perfect for people with side feet because normally you have to mold your feet to fit the shoe but with this one, the shoe mold to your feet. Which is amazing.! I definitely recommend these.",KDO46
5,10/19/2016,You won't regret your purchase!! Very comfortable and stylish love the laces. Love to go running and just wear when i want to feel comfortble,KDO46
5,10/19/2016,"Literally amazing. AMAZING. I'm obsessed!!! These are the best shoes I've ever owned. They're the only pair of shoes I've had on my feet since I received them over a week ago. They really do feel like socks, but have tons of great support. And I've gotten so many compliments on them! They're so stylish. I wear them to the gym and everyday with jeans. After having purchased and returned a very uncomfortable pair or nikes--the air max theas--I am overjoyed with the edge luxe and I'll continue to buy Adidas shoes from now on. I got them in white. They have a nice subtle beige design. Laces are awesome! Okay I'm obsessed with these shoes. BUY THEM!",KDO46

5,10/16/2016,I love these shoes! Very light and comfortable. I ordered these shoes to mostly be worn for just chores around the house or a quick pair to throw on when I go to the store. Since getting them I have even worn them to the gym and they worked great! I absolutely love these shoes and always get compliments!,KDO46
4,10/15/2016,"Lovely, stylish, highly recommended Comfortable and stylish product. The thin sock-like upper makes for a snug fit, but it is also a little too thin and I could see the outline of my toes through the upper material - needless to say there is little protection provided if anything drops on my feet. However, this means it is super breathable. Both plus and minus on this feature. Otherwise lovely shoes, would highly recommend.",KDO46
5,10/14/2016,Very comfortable!! The Edge Lux Shoes are very comfortable and stylish.,KDO46
5,10/14/2016,Great shoe I like the fit and the style but the quality is average,KDO46
3,10/13/2016,"Love how the shoes feel, but a hole happened near the front of the shoe as soon as I wore them. Cheaply made. The shoes got a hole in them within the first week of wearing them. Near the front of the shoe. I really love how these shoes feel, they are flexible, comfortable, and quite stylish. I'm super disappointed that this hole happened as soon as I wore them. They are athletic shoes and not just for show, so I feel like they should be more durable. Not sure how the hole happened.",KDO46

4,09/21/2016,"Love these! Love the gray! Very easy to get on and off. By the picture, the laces look like straps but they are tie laces. The thicker laces make it look cool. I have a very high arch so not much support there to be used for running or extensive training. Overall a very good sneaker for everyday use.",KDO46
5,09/21/2016, These shoes are so comfortable!! They silhouette on them is feminine and cool. A coworker of mine actually walked by and doubled back to peek his head into my work space to tell me he liked them the first day I wore them.,KDO46
5,09/21/2016,"Great quality and price Very comfortable, great look sneakers. Got them in 2 different colors",KDO46
5,09/20/2016, style and look and comfort would recommend this shoe to others,KDO46
5,09/20/2016, LOVE! Affordable price for high-quality shoes !!!!,KDO46
5,09/20/2016,"BEST SHOES EVER!!! GREAT COMFORTABLE AND LOOKING GOOD Amazing shoes, great looking and very comfortable!!! It's all i need to work",KDO46
5,09/19/2016,LOVE LOVE LOVE! So cute and comfortable highly recommend! I wouldn't suggest running in them but great for an everyday casual sneaker.,KDO46
1,09/19/2016,"Not worth the price They are a thin sock like material that your toes show through, not very durable & definitely worth the price",KDO46
5,09/19/2016, Comfy and the black sneakers look so nice with every outfit,KDO46
5,09/18/2016,"Adidas never disappoints , love my shoes !:) Very comfortable and they look great! The shipping was accurate and free! I'll definitely be ordering more",KDO46
5,09/16/2016,"Adidas fits me best Love the softness and the support. Love the styling. I don't run, I walk, so don't know about running. But the shoes are very comfortable.",KDO46
5,09/14/2016,"Definitely recommend these shoes! Extremely cute and comfortable! I love these shoes! They are extremely comfortable and stylish. I'm usually an 8.5 but in all my running shoes I am an 8, so that is what I purchased in this pair and the fit is perfect! Love the white color although it has a bit of tan in it, just to know as a heads up incase you're really looking for a stark white shoe.",KDO46
5,09/12/2016,"Soooo in love with these I love these shoes, they have everything I could ask for style and comfort. Just ordered them in white and plan to order a few more different colors. Scotchguard is a must if you want to keep them clean.",KDO46
5,09/10/2016," the colour is perfect,a little wide for slim feet.",KDO46
5,09/07/2016,"Better for the price, especially compared to Nike prices. no tongue-- so nothing slides and no adjusting. Paid 1/3 less for them than the nikes I usually purchase every season-- and these are aesthetically and physically more impressive. my only con is that the toes feel loose due to the material used. I also usually wear around an 8 but ordered a 7.5 and they are NOT snug, so I believe I can say the sizes must run big.",KDO46
5,09/05/2016,"Super comfy! I love these shoes because they're super comfy while also on trend. I purchased the white/red color which look more tan/off white/red, but I actually like the color more than I did in the picture. They're very versatile and can be paired with jeans, shorts, or athletic gear. I purchased for casual wear but they're so comfy that I plan to make them my go to running shoes",KDO46
3,09/04/2016," The shoes came up too large for a size 6, and the colour is slightly darker than the picture",KDO46
5,09/02/2016,"Love Love Love these shoes! Super comfortable and so sporty! Great color of blue. I usually size up a half size in running shoes so I ordered 10.5 and it's a great fit....thank you Addidas your my new ""go to""",KDO46
5,09/02/2016,Worth the money In love.......with these sneakers it's like walking on clouds. I would totally recommend them.,KDO46
5,09/02/2016,"Fabulous This is no doubt the best looking athletic shoe I have ever purchased. And I have purchased a few in my time. I'm 70 years old. The comfort is outstanding. The style is different but similiar to other athletic shoes. Classic!! Beautiful Colors. I just wish you would restock the color pink. have the blue and black. Beautiful, comfortable, stylish athletic shoe. Thank you.",KDO46
5,09/02/2016,"Good for wide feet It is super comfortable, lovely color but a bit pinker then I expected. It is more on the orange side when view from the photo. 
Got a size 8 and fit perfectly and stay comfortable. I am a busy mom and on my feet all day.",KDO46
5,08/30/2016,Comfortable and also attractive They support my feet for my workouts and also look good too,KDO46
4,08/25/2016,"Good Buy I think first off the color is amazing, and the overall fit of the shoe is great! Bit snug compared to other shoes in general, although not complaining as it contours your foot well.",KDO46
5,08/18/2016,"Not usually a trainer person, but these are worth every penny Very classy looking. Extremely comfortable and is a good item in anyones wardrobe.",KDO46
5,08/17/2016,I hope they never stop selling these! I love these shoes so much! I initially ordered 8.5 because I vary between 8 and 8.5 and I read reviews saying to order larger because of the snug fit but I exchanged them for an 8 due to too much room in the toe. The 8 is perfect and I love them so much! So comfortable- they also have great support as I have flat feet! I got the blue and now bought a second pair in the gray. The gray will be for everyday wear and I'll use the blue as my gym shoes!,KDO46
4,08/17/2016,Great stylish shoe and great colour Great stylish shoe and great colour.Very cormftable.,KDO46
5,08/12/2016, It's look smooth and fit perfectly well on my feet,KDO46
5,08/11/2016,Excellent !!! The shoes are fashionable and comfortable after I got my first pair I bought another pain but in a different color 3 days later.,KDO46
5,08/11/2016," Sturdy heel, comfy under the ball of the foot, yes you can see your toes a little but it's not too bad.
Over all in love with them, I have the green/beige ones!",KDO46
5,08/10/2016, Awesome shoe! Probably buying another pair in a different color soon!,KDO46
5,08/10/2016,These are the best sneakers Perfect lookI get so many compliments on my sneakers everybody always asked me what are they Nikes I'll say no these are Adidas,KDO46
4,08/10/2016,Comfortable shoe Love the style and comfort - however they were kind of dirty like they had been returned - I didn't expect that getting them directly from Adidas.com ... I emailed customer support but no reply :( but as far as the comfort and style - I highly recommend ...,KDO46
5,08/08/2016," very comfortable, little weird with the sock top but very very supportive",KDO46
5,08/05/2016,Fave shoes everrrrrr Obsessed with these! But I dont wear them to work out in,KDO46
5,08/04/2016,Great product Excellent product really struggled with pain when running and the comfort and support from these trainers have made the world of difference,KDO46
2,08/02/2016,"Disappointing purchase I bought these shoes for a comfortable pair of lifestyle shoes, not to work out in by any means. After two weeks of wearing them around the seam around the ankle ripped. These shoes are super comfortable but wish the quality would have been better. A waste of money for a pair of shoes that will not last more than a month.",KDO46
5,07/30/2016,One of my favorite pairs of athletic shoes I've ever purchased These shoes are great because they're so unique and INCREDIBLY comfortable.,KDO46
5,07/29/2016,I love them! I like them because they look classy and really comfortable to wear.,KDO46
4,07/28/2016,"Color looks different I eyed these shoes in the faded pink color for the longest time, when I finally ordered them I was surprised at how much pinker they actually were. the picture makes it look like a faded color when in reality it is a bright pink. Overall still a very cute shoe.",KDO46
4,07/27/2016,"Super nice color and I Love how comfortable They are!! First time I get Adidas running shoes, Ive always been a Nike shoe freak, these pair of shoes did not disappoint, unfortunately I have 7,5 in Nike and ordered the same in these Adidas and they ended up being too big, so double check your sizing before buying these.",KDO46
4,07/24/2016,"Great purchase The shoes are very comfortable, but a little hard to get on. It is definitely worth the money.",KDO46
5,07/23/2016,Great Perfect mix of running shoe with comfort and support and fashion.,KDO46
5,07/19/2016,Cute Buy What attracted me to the sneakers at first were the laces which makes them look sleeker and it doesn't draw attention away from the shoe. Bought these for work and I must say they're pretty comfy for walking long periods of time. They are sock like so I don't know if socks are meant to be worn with them but when I did my feet were slightly hot but not super uncomfortable. I've gotten many compliments on this shoe and the laces in a particular. I would say to size up half a size because while they are meant to feel like a sock they should still fit like a sneaker meaning having a little tiny bit of wiggle room,KDO46
5,07/18/2016,Makes me want to run!! They are so cushioned and I love the wide straps. Also the way it wraps around the foot gives a perfect supportive fit.,KDO46
4,07/17/2016, Sooo comfy. Saw them in the store and I just had to get them. I love the look of it. The only thing I'm kind of eh about is how I can see the outline of my feet.. Yikes.,KDO46
5,07/17/2016,"Best purchase in a long time I love Edge Lux...I have flat feet (no arches) and they fit perfectly. I am on my feet at work all day and at the end of the day, my feet are not painful like they used to be. I have already purchased two pairs and will be ordering more.",KDO46
5,07/17/2016,"Very happy with this purchase! Feels like I am walking on carpet. Very lightweight, holds it's shape very well.",KDO46
5,07/17/2016,"Great shoes, well worth the money They look great, exactly like they do in the picture, super comfortable",KDO46
4,07/16/2016,Great shoe would recommend. Great show light and comfy. Wife really likes wearing them for the gym,KDO46
5,07/13/2016, it is so comfortable WALKING AND RUNNING SHOE GOOD FOR TRACK,KDO46
2,07/11/2016," I received these Edge Luxe Shoes in the Adidas Avenue A subscription box with a few other items. I loved them immediately but put them on for a few hours and they were a bit tight around the base of my foot. I don't usually need a wide but maybe with this pair I do. So, not a big deal but I went to put them on again and realized that rubber on the tip of the shoe is peeling back. Again, I wore these for just a few hours at my desk job and they are falling apart? Not happy with the selection of this box. Especially since the FitU watch isn't accurate in step counting and I've reached out to support several times and received no instructions that have worked or made the tracker work properly. It's been calibrated, I did a hard factory reset and yet I still gain 1000 or more steps while sitting in my car in a two hour commute everyday. I really love Adidas but I am so disappointed with these last few items.",KDO46
4,07/10/2016, I brought these for my daughter i received them yesterday she love's them. The only thing is I brought white but is more beige so if you'll looking for a all white sneakers don't get these...other then that a great sneakers...ENJOY!!!,KDO46
4,07/08/2016,"good price for the good shoes super comfy and light weight, it was a bit tight when i first wear it, but after few steps i felt great.",KDO46
5,07/08/2016,"Cute comfortable and stylish Love theses shoes. I got them in the white and they are very comfortable. I also get lots of complements on how they look. I haven't ran I them though, just casual use.",KDO46
5,07/08/2016,"Love these. Love these, very comfortable. Recommend going a half size up from your normal size.",KDO46
5,07/06/2016,"Sock-like fit holds true! A little tight initially but after a few wears, these shoes feel perfect! Very light and super sleek.",KDO46
3,06/30/2016,"Nice color but feels like sock I love the color of the sneaker but I didn't like that my toes will show, the sneaker is like a sock, inlove everything about the sneaker but not the material been to thin, my sister is keeping them",KDO46
5,06/30/2016, Loved the color and the style. So comfortable. Will definitely be ordering more.,KDO46
2,06/29/2016,Alright Very comfortable but a way brighter pink than shown in the picture,KDO46
5,06/28/2016, Comfortable and sleek. Fit perfect. Comes with two styles of laces.,KDO46
4,06/23/2016,"Great shoe! Why you like the product or why not? They are super comfy! I wear mine for work, it feels like I'm walking on clouds, definitely recommend if you are on your feet all day",KDO46
4,06/15/2016,Very cute and comfortable! I love the pink color! Looks exactly like the picture!,KDO46
3,06/12/2016,"Could look even more awesome if laces weren't awkward. I bought this shoe to wear on vacation with lots of walking (not running). I really like the shoe for its general design and comfort. The only thing that is awkward is the lacing. It's hard to lace it in a way that avoids tying a front knot because it's hard to tuck the laces in the shoe. There's no lace hole to insert the laces back through the inside. Instead, you have to tuck the laces over the side of the shoe :/ The site picture shows the laces tucked over the edge as I describe. Visible and awkward.",KDO46
5,11/29/2017,Best shoe But i want triple white color for this shoe or cream white,EGA42
5,11/11/2017,"Most comfortable shoe ever If you ever try this shoe on, you will be amazed at how comfortable and stable it is and you won't want to wear another. I really love it and hope it's quality remains the same in the long run.",EGA42
5,10/20/2017," As a cross country runner, Ultraboost ST is one of the most comfortable and supportive shoes. Highly recommended",EGA42
5,10/14/2017,Most comfortable I have ever worn Extremely conformable to wear and look really good.,EGA42
5,09/29/2017,"Great shoes, inaccurate color What I thought I was buying was the best pair of blue shoes ever. What I got was the best pair of TEAL shoes ever. It’s not even close. 
As for the shoes, best, most comfortable runners I’ve ever owned. I bought black and red, which are actually black and orange, but at least they are close. The blue isn’t even remotely close.",EGA42
4,08/21/2017,"Superb in comfort but needs more quality control I've always preferred Air Max for my runs but after constant nags by my friend over past few months, I finally gave in to the Boost technology. I prefer extra support at the arch, so decided to go with the Ultraboost ST. This is definitely way more comfortable than I had expected. I had read so many reviews saying it feels like walking on the cloud and now I know it wasn't really exaggeration, it does feel like you're walking on the cloud. I have no regrets spending $$$ on this but I do have one complaint. The stitching at end of the tongue (towards the front side) on my right shoe kind of touches the left top of my foot. I don't feel it if I'm wearing a thick sock but it irritates me a bit with my regular/sports socks. Also, I have tried wearing the shoe without socks and I'm 100% sure I'll get a blister if I'm on my foot for a couple of hours in these without a sock. The left side shoe is perfect! And it's not just my foot because I've asked my friend to try it and he felt the same thing. This is not a problem if I'm wearing any sock but for a $190 pair, I expected a better quality control.",EGA42
4,12/04/2017,"Great runners Excellent, fast service. I love my new runners. This is my 5th pair of Boost. They’re the best.",BEZ75
3,11/14/2017,It's ok Ordered it online and it was too big. The fit also looked weird.,BEZ75
3,11/05/2017,Way too big Unfortunately I had to return these. I think I’d have to try them on in a store. I ordered them in the normal size I usually use for adidas ultra boosts and these felt almost a full size too large. I’ve never had that happen before. But they felt comfy and looked great!,BEZ75
4,11/02/2017, the trainers provide the support i was looking for,BEZ75
5,10/31/2017,Best choice I like the product . It is very comfortable to wear within the reasonable price . It is highly recommended those people loves to walk and run.,BEZ75
2,10/30/2017,runs large loved the support in the footbed. unfortunately i wore them maybe for 5 workouts and they stretched out so bad i had zero support. the shoe was slipping and sliding so bad that my feet cramped up and my IT band hurt so bad I was unable to run after. extremely disappointing for a $200 pair of running shoes.,BEZ75
4,10/13/2017,Love it Very comfortable shoes and My insole fit perfectly,BEZ75
5,10/05/2017," Exceptionaly comfortable, great colour and lightweight.",BEZ75
5,10/04/2017,Awesome Trainers I have just started running - went to a store so I could be filmed and fitted with the right trainers - I needed Stability shoes and these ticked all the boxes - i love them - comfort - colour - style - AWESOME :-),BEZ75
5,10/03/2017,I love these! Comfort and Cool. I love the look. The texture seems like it hides dirt really well. Very spongey.,BEZ75
4,09/09/2017,Fantastic comfort only issue is they are narrow but extremely comfortable. I went up a half size as I do with all my running however found these narrower than my other adidas boost. As comfort goes these are a great distance shoe.,BEZ75
5,08/21/2017, Love them!! They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned!  My son loves his as well!,BEZ75
5,08/10/2017,"ULTRA BOOST ST IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME I absolutely LOVE the Ultra Boost ST. They have a traditional upper, not the stiff / tight sock style that most running shoes now have. They are so comfortable and the boost adds a little oophf. They are hands down my favorite pair of shoes. I just bought another pair because I love the first pair I bought a year ago so much and was worried they wouldn't be available. The color options were meh. I was lucky to have got grey/blue... but as a women, I DON'T want pink and purple and I'm tired of them being the only options or secondary color option (like pops of color).",BEZ75
5,08/01/2017,Brilliant trainers Very comfortable and perfect fitting for size. Like walking on sponge.,BEZ75
5,07/30/2017,"Excellent comfort and look It is very comfortable and looks good. Like the colour a lot . It goes well with black ,white ,navy -most outfits that I have . I like the foam boost base",BEZ75

5,07/19/2017,"Perfect running shoe! Whether brand new or broken in, they are always comfortable. They never slide on my feet or cause any blisters. This is my second pair and I highly recommend!",BEZ75
5,12/01/2017,"great shoe. comfortable, stylish, much compliments. I like how the tongue of the shoe is overlapped, allowing more space for freedom. last year's pure boosts didn't have this feature - they're more like ultra boosts in their design. I like the originality of these pure boosts.",BEZ99
4,09/19/2017,These shoes despite not being ultraboosts still perform just as well. Great for running but I would recommend for casual too because of this color way Perfect but my only problem was the double stitching kind of made the shoe a bit awkward but other than that great job adidas!,BEZ99
5,09/15/2017,Nice Product Very Smart looking shoes. Not bad at all. Im happy with this product and i love it.,BEZ99
2,08/25/2017,"Overrated and pointless I wanted knitted shoes because they look comfortable, but they just aren't. Like socks with a sole, where the socks need lacing. What's the point?!",BEZ99
5,07/30/2017,"Fave shoes ever Very comfy for both leisure and active wear. Colors are perfect, very stylish. I've received a lot of compliments at work, at the gym, and around town. Low-medium arch support, the wide base make these ideal for my trips to the gym or even trail running, while being nice and dark enough to wear out for date night or semi-casual dinner. Best purchase I've made!",BEZ99
5,07/28/2017,"great purchase its really comfortable, I will recommend this shoe to any runner.",BEZ99
5,07/26/2017, Great quality and they are comfortable. Free shipping was nice as well,BEZ99

1,07/21/2017,"Could've been good The shoe seems awesome in terms if comfort and style. Unfortunately I didn't get to wear it even once since one of the eyelets broke off from the right shoe when I was loosening the laces to get it on. Could've been good, but quality not up to par",BEZ99
4,07/20/2017,Good for casual use as well as running. 9/10. No insole feels a bit weird on bottom of foot. Upper knot material very comfortable.,BEZ99
5,07/19/2017,"The Black Sole Is Class - Looks Amazing, Wears Amazing I don't think there is any better sole than boost, in existence. The upper's on these trainers breath so well also, perfect combination",BEZ99
5,07/13/2017," Comfortable, style, these have it all. I will continue to buy more of these",BEZ99

3,07/05/2017,"Not for me but nice looking shoes! These shoes did not fit very well and I probably could have sized down a half size, which may have alleviated most of my issues. I liked the black boost sole and black and white print. I really did not like the fold over or burrito style tongue as some have called it. The material was more stiff than expected. Since I had purchased other shoes that fit well, I decided to return these instead of exchange for a different size.",BEZ99
5,07/02/2017, These shoes are so comfortable and easy to wear during workout,BEZ99
3,07/02/2017,None I have two pairs navy blue and core blk. Had to settle for blk. Got tried of waiting for triple black to come in stores in San Francisco,BEZ99
5,06/27/2017,Amazing I bought these for my boyfriend as a graduation gift. He can not stop raving about them. They also look very neat on foot and he says they are very comfortable.,BEZ99
1,06/27/2017,"Looks great, but sizing is a little small. Looks great, but sizing was off for me. I'm typically a 9.5 US in Adidas but found my toes to be crunched up against the front. Would otherwise be comfortable, but unfortunately not sure I can wear them with the sizing off. Results in a waste of money.",BEZ99

5,06/22/2017," great feel, boost isn't as fluffy as other boost shoes but provides a sturdier stage for running. I use them for every day wear, but could definitely see them replacing my current pair of running shoes as I break them in. Very flashy, I've gotten many compliments in them. Only complaint is that they get called fake yeezys, which is also a plus if you like that style of shoe.",BEZ99
5,06/19/2017,Perfect Exactly what I wanted. Extremely comfortable. Perfect.,BEZ99
5,06/19/2017,"Great feel, great durability. I'll be one hundred percent honest; that folded tongue was weird at first. I bought a very similar colorway from Finish Line in the pureboost ltd about three months ago. I also own two color ways of the NMD. I sized up by a half size in the pureboosts and I wish I had done the same in the NMDs. I like how comfortable the Pureboosts are. I like the width of the toe box and the snug fit of the upper that still allows for a bit of movement. Those night cargo jawnz are too nice.",BEZ99

2,06/18/2017,"Nowhere close to Ultraboost. I just got these and was hoping they'd have a similar comfort level to the Ultraboost, which I love and have owned three pairs.  The pattern on the insole is the exact same pattern as the bottom of the (squares), yet the pattern is raised ever so slightly, so the comfort is compromised, and the footbed is nowhere near as plush and cushy as the Ultraboost.",BEZ99

4,06/15/2017,"Awesome shoes Great comfortable fit. It is an amazing looking shoe. My only issue with this shoe is that the bottom gets dirty easily, and that's after I used a water and stain repellent spray on it. I'd suggest getting one with a dark bottom if that's an issue for you. Besides that, I feel satisfied with the purchase.",BEZ99

5,06/05/2017," Really comfortable and stylish shoes, perfect for everyday use without getting sore feet. The tongue is unusual but perfectly comfortable once the shoes are on foot. Would have liked the alternate laces to be circular rather than flat but other than that really amazing shoe.",BEZ99

5,06/02/2017,"Another great pair of shoes Second pair of the new Pure Boosts I have purchased.  I have the maroon ones as well and these are just as good.  Same great quality and comfort.  The tongue still and bumps on the bottom of the shoes still take some getting used to, but I am happy that they packaged a second set of flat laces to replace the thick ones in the picture. The flat laces are much better so I recommend switching them out.",BEZ99
5,05/31/2017,"Awesome kicks!!! Believe the hype!
Awesome sneakers. I own many sneakers and these are the most comfortable, stylish and well made sneakers I own. Great to have on your feet for any reason. Adidas got it right with the boost.",BEZ99

5,05/26/2017,Love it It's comfortable and cheap for its price. I wish their were no pods on the side.,BEZ99
4,05/26/2017, the fabric upper keeps my feet cool when it's hot!,BEZ99
4,05/26/2017,"Very very soft comfortable shoe, need more ultra boosts I like the shoe but returned because it ran big. It is one of the softest shoes I have felt but would definitely like to see it with a gum sole. Runs a 1/2 size big. Now looking for a sik ultra boost, with a gum sole.",BEZ99

5,05/25/2017,Comfortable and light The shoes is light and very comfortable really good with wide feet,BEZ99
1,05/22/2017,Waste of my money Was not happy with the durability of this shoe at all! Have barely worn the shoes literally a few days and already the insole is coming off the boost as well as the outsole and a couple defects here and there. For 160 dollars its a joke the the quality could be so poor,BEZ99
5,05/21/2017,"I love these shoes! The comfort and look of this shoe is rather impressive. If you are new to the Boost shoes or a big fan, you will love this shoe.",BEZ99

5,05/16/2017,"Great looking, incredibly comfortable So comfortable, could walk in these all day without any issue.",BEZ99
5,05/14/2017,Five stars Great Value I bought this product a week ago and have only had it for a day now and I have to say this is my second pair of adidas boost the comfort in the heel is insanity and I expected less for it being painted. The boost has some sort of a glossy finish over it and the burrito style tongue raps around the top of your foot and feels like a sock. there is no insole in these shoes and some people complained about that but in my opinion it is still as comfortable as any shoe with an insole. I love how adidas can show that there boost is comfortable without any sort of insole. It's awesome. Overall after having this shoe for a DAY! I can happily say go a half size up it is a very comfortable shoe and recommend it to everyone no matter the use,BEZ99
4,05/13/2017,"Great purchase Very comfortable trainers, excellent for running in",BEZ99
5,05/13/2017,"Pure boost Sooooo sick!!! If you're not into the uncaged or want to use a running shoe, this is a great alternative. It's sole makes for a great comfortable firm step and it's material looks great with anything you wear.",BEZ99
5,05/12/2017, Very comfortable.. worth of money and stylist.....,BEZ99
5,05/10/2017,"Comfort meets Style It's stylish and comfortable.  I've always loved boost shoes and this does not fail.  However, this is the first boost shoes I own where the sole isn't white and I loved it.",BEZ99
5,05/09/2017,Best boost ever Good looking pair of shoes. Love the colours. They feel very comfortable.,BEZ99
5,05/07/2017,The best Up there with ultraboost one of the best shoes Adidas have produced with quality to match,BEZ99
5,05/05/2017,Boost is life Game changer. Shoe has it all. One of the dopest shoes I own.,BEZ99
5,04/20/2017, Really great walking shoes instead of running.This is shoes is really comfortable in terms of walking. But I find it does not provide enough support for running.,BEZ99
3,04/06/2017,"Very comfortable, just not durable. Very comfortable shoe; however after only a month of casual wear and light running, outsole is starting to show signs of separation from the boost. Great for casual wear, not so much for running. Average score due to it's durability.",BEZ99
4,03/31/2017," Theres some random purple string used near the lace holes, kinda stands out on the grey shoe.",BEZ99
3,03/30/2017,Comfortable in soul Very comfortable in heal. Toebox needs to be wider. You know most shoes tear by your pinky toe do to not being wide enough and forcing it to stretch too much. This shoe has that same issue,BEZ99
5,03/25/2017,"Very good shoe. The shoe is great, it is very comfortable and looks nice. Two things I would've like to know are the inside is purple and the tongue is not like a normal tongue it is two pieces of fabric. Otherwise it is a great shoe if you are okay with that.",BEZ99
5,03/21/2017,"Comfortable and looks great Just got these in the mail today, and I have to say - one of the most comfortable and great looking shoes, comparable to the ultra boosts. I usually wear 9.5 men's UB and I have wide feet, so I went down .5 size for the Pure Boosts and they're perfect. No awkward toe or foot-looking bulges because the PB designed a wider toe-box for running, as it's made for, and it fits like a glove. I'm actually starting to prefer the Pures now because it's slightly (just slightly, like 15% less boost vs Ultras) less cushioning than the Ultras, so it helps for standing at work for 6-8 hours. Exercise wise, I wore them to my Filipino martial arts class where a lot of footwork is involved, and the Pures delivered. Dope shoe, I recommend these 100%",BEZ99
5,03/12/2017,Very nice shoes! This color combo looks even better in person! I like it better than the pure black version. Size is perfect. I love the color combo and the overall design! 5 stars!!!,BEZ99
5,03/08/2017,Oh my lord so Comfortable These shoes are amazing. They feel like you are walking on pillows and Everytime I take a step I feel like falling asleep.,BEZ99
5,03/05/2017, Fits like a glove! Great cushion for any type of activity!,BEZ99
5,03/05/2017,"MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE I OWN! LOVE THESE SHOES!!! I've had adidas but this is my first boost I love them, so comfortable will be buying more in the future that's for sure!",BEZ99
5,02/28/2017,Normally a size 12 in shoes but went down to an 11 for the Pure Boost and they fit perfect. Great if you have wide feet like myself. Been wanting a pair for the longest. Very comfortable. Went down a full size and I'm a big dude so I would recommend.,BEZ99
5,02/28/2017,Finest purchase I have made It's comfortable and would recommend to anyone who likes shoes,BEZ99
3,02/27/2017,"doesnt look like the photo the boost is not white, it is silver or grey. picture doesnt look like the shoe",BEZ99
5,02/26/2017,Beautiful These are the best looking Pureboosts that have been released. I like the sock like fit and they're more supportive than the first ones I bought a couple of years ago. Now if they only put these on miadidas along with the ultraboost....,BEZ99
5,02/25/2017,"Better in person Wasn't sure about how I felt about the color wave compared to others before I bought them, However as soon as I put them on my feet I knew these were the ones.",BEZ99
5,02/24/2017,Shoe of the year from Adidas Im hoping people continue to miss this color scheme and shoe. This is one of the nicest Pure Boost shoe available. Its super comfy and looks very similar to another product that sells out on Adidas in minutes.,BEZ99
5,02/20/2017,"Most comfortable pair I've owned! I've been looking for the perfect pair of Boost shoes for a couple months, I was excited when I finally tried on the PureBoost and instantly fell in love. It help that they look amazing aswell!",BEZ99
5,02/16/2017,"Best Adidas of the year The Ultraboost and NMD have brought me back to the 3 Stripes, having said that this shoe is my favorite of those 3. It looks amazing and feels the best of the 3. Keep dope colorways coming and I'll keep buying.",BEZ99
5,12/06/2017,Bring back the colors Great shoe but why do we have to enter the drab color phase again?  Adidas please provide some color options!,CBY27

5,12/05/2017,"BEST SHOES EVER! I first bought pure boost last 2016 in Japan and i love it so i decided to buy these ultraboost and it is very comfortable, for two months i use it 4 times a week. Now my third Boost are on the way the ultraboost uncaged. I didn’t get a chance to finish my order when the time Ace 16+ was launched and I’m hoping soon there will be an available size for me.",CBY27
5,12/04/2017,"I’m flat footed with no arch. I recommend!! I have flat, wide feet with no arch, so it’s extremely hard for me to find shoes of comfort, in which I typically would wear sandals. But weather changing and sandals are not the best for feet I needed good shoes. I was skeptic with Addidas at first And thought they looked funny but I was wrong, soo comfortable. These shoes are pricey but worth it. It’s like a tempur-pedic for your feet .",CBY27
5,12/04/2017,Wow Best shoe ever So I have 3 pairs of NMDs and 1 one pair of ultraboost 3.0. But the 4.0s are a game changer for good,CBY27
5,12/04/2017,"Incredible shoes,  very happy with purchase This is my 4th pair of ultra boost and I love them all.  Comfort is unmatched by ANY other shoe on the market.# boostislife #3stripelife",CBY27
5,12/03/2017,Most comfortable shoes I ever owned. As a flat footed person its hard to find shoes that can be comfortable all day. My foot pain and knee pain has almost disappeared. The kicks are so comfortable I rather wear them around the house than just wearing socks.,CBY27
5,12/01/2017,The gold standard for comfort and performance I'm flat footed and have fairly wide feet so I was reluctant at first to buy a pair of shoes that were slightly narrow but as soon as I put them on all my worries were gone. The Ultra Boost is probably the most comfortable shoe that I've ever had on my feet. The comfort and support that the Boost sole provides is groundbreaking. I never used to like running until I bought the Ultra Boost.,CBY27
5,11/30/2017,"GOAT Hands down, the Ultraboost line smashes every other sneaker I’ve worn. I’m on my feet 12 hours a night and the 3 variants of the Ultraboost that I’ve purchased are beyond a pleasure to wear.",CBY27

5,11/06/2017,"Little on the pricey side but very happy. I loved them so much I bought a second pair, when my first pair started showing wear. Now 2 years 1300 miles on 2 pairs of shoes I'm happy with that. So far 830 miles this year alone. Running 25+ miles a week. About to buy my 3rd pair as I start training for a marathon.",CBY27
5,11/05/2017,Great purchase. Would buy every colorway if I could. Best shoe I’ve ever bought. Most comfortable shoe out there. Not much of a high performance runner but if you need it to be than it can get the job done.,CBY27
5,11/05/2017,Most comfortable shoes ever Like stepping on bubble pops. Nice material choices.,CBY27
1,10/31/2017,"Completely overprice and hyped. Narrow Too I was excited to get these, but they are not as comfortable as everyone says as they are very narrow. They should maybe running shoes for actual men with man size feet. I digress, bottom line is, I returned them and if you have wide feet look elsewhere",CBY27
5,10/30/2017,"These are a must for Runners/Sneakerheads I recently bought a pair of UltraBOOST and I can't get over how comfortable they are, The Primeknit is so breathable and stretchy and comfortable, but the most important of all, the boost midsole, the boost is incredibly responsive (Much more responsive then that of the NMD) And every time you take a single step, you feel the energy being absorbed and returned, its an amazing feeling, I could walk all day in these shoes, These do run narrow so people with wide feet, if you are a size 10 than go up half a size (or true to size) because these run true to size, if you have a narrow foot you should probably go for your same size, These are amazing, I highly recommend you buy these.",CBY27
1,10/30/2017, The product was overpriced by a long shot. Need some improvements in stability.,CBY27
3,10/30/2017,"Primeknit ripped Primeknit frayed, kind of disappointed. Needs durability",CBY27
5,10/30/2017,"great but not the best love to finally own a pair, but i think its overrated. great but not the best",CBY27
5,10/30/2017,great bought to run but not the best for running great for casual wear,CBY27
5,10/29/2017, Excellent purchase. Probably the best running shoes and even set two PBs in them.,CBY27
5,10/28/2017,Best Shoe EVER!!!!!! When I got the ultra boost it was so comfy and not narrow. Get it right away. I thought they would be sold out but they weren't. Trust me they look way better in person.,CBY27
4,10/28/2017,"Great shoes, but a few drawbacks. I was lucky enough to get my ultra boosts in the size and color I wanted and was very pleased with them until the actual boost mid sole detached from the prime knit upper and also caused a crack/split vertically in the boost. Another somewhat minor problem is the fraying that occurs arond the toe area, but this can be dealt with using a fabric shaver. Overall I really liked the shoe but I was displeased with the incident regarding the separation of sole and upper.",CBY27
4,10/27/2017,They are great but the continental bottom does not last as long as expected. Yeah this product is awesome I recommend them especially if your foot is narrow. This shoe is slightly narrow on my feet personally but the primeknit is stretchy witch evens it out. Overall the product is great and I recommend it,CBY27
1,10/27/2017,"They are way way to tight in the ankle area, i would like a refund These are the only sneakers that are extremely tight in the ankle area, i would like a refund",CBY27
1,10/27/2017, These shoes fell apart after less than a month and a half of wearing them. Terrible quality for the price. The sol of the shoe began to completely separate from the top. Would not recommend for the price as they will only fall apart shortly after purchase,CBY27
5,10/25/2017,"Best comfort out there Let me start by saying I haven't owned a pair of Adidas shoes since high school. With that said these shoes are amazing. I've own quite a few of other brands but the comfort in these have left me not wearing any other shoes. The type of comfort is not comparable to any of them. I would put it to feel like a high quality memory foam mattress. They are built very well it seems like (I watched a YouTube video where someone wore them a year and tentatively put 1000 miles on them, they were the V. 1s though) I wear them whenever I'm off work since I have to wear boots at work. If I was to guess I'd say I have put easily 50 miles on them with no sign of wear on the tread. They are getting dirty on the primeknit and the Boost material, but only the primeknit because my wife and I have a 3 month old German Shepherd that love to step on them when we are outside. The fit for me is perfect, some might say they are snug but I like my shoes like that, I ordered my normal size. As they look right now I am willing to say they will last years for me. I have no complaints about these shoes at all and I can't wait to see what newer versions will bring. The only thing I wish they would do in the future is bring back the limited edition leather cage ones.",CBY27
5,10/25/2017,"BUY RIGHT NOW!!!!BEST SHOE EVER SLIP ON MY FEET Its a slick, all day every day shoe, every comfortable, only down side about it, the shoe is a snug fit so i would recomend going a half size up, other then that you really get yourself a pair now!!!",CBY27
5,10/25/2017,Underrated Colorway. This colorway of the Ultraboost 3.0 is highly underrated. They look great on foot n I prefer them to a few of my limited edition colorways. They r Ultraboost so the comfort is great n need not be mentioned but I mentioned it anyway since they’re that comfy. U can’t go wrong with ANY Ultraboost but this colorway is a sleeper. Wake up n cop folks.,CBY27
4,10/25/2017,"Good buy, but Continental outsole sub-par I have been a long time other brand shoe fan, but I loved this shoe since the first time I tried them on. Great fit, feel, comfort, and style, but once I bought  them I realized that the outsole provided little if any traction in the gym or any smooth surface. It almost seems like the outsole has been worn down for a long time, even though they are brand new. I still love them, just wish the continental outsole was better.",CBY27
5,10/25/2017,"Best shoes I ever wore I had NMD's before, and they were great, but after I bought these ultraboosts, I've only been wearing them because they are the most comfortable shoes ever",CBY27

5,10/21/2017,"Great sneaker! The UltraBOOST line isn't just all hype. It is definitely one of, if not the most comfortable shoe on the market currently. It's fit is perfect for running, but also stylish enough to serve as your everyday lifestyle shoe. The primeknit is extremely comfortable and gives it a premium look, and the wool stitched into this version is a nice touch for the fall.",CBY27
5,10/20/2017,Amazing quality and comfort Most comfortable shoes I own. Love the primeknit. I highly recommend them.,CBY27
5,10/20/2017,Absolute Comfort Looks great on feet and of course it is still the most comfortable shoes ever. The 3.0 is a little wide compared to the previous model thus making it easy to slip on.,CBY27

2,10/18/2017,"Blue UltraBoost - you call that blue?! I'm a huge fan of the Ultra Boost. I have a white one already and wanted a new color so I went for the blue one. When I received it, I was sorely disappointed. There was still evidence of glue where it was put together and the blue was not blue whatsoever. It was more of a teal or bluish-green. Immediately returned it back to them. Don't recommend anyone buys anything blue from Adidas; you'll probably get anything but blue.",CBY27
5,10/18/2017,Best comfortable shoe out there ! I love the style of the shoe and the various colors,CBY27
5,10/17/2017,Most comfortable shoes EVER I’ve had lower spine issues for years and avoided a lot of shoes that have extra support because they just look horrible. Adidas has found the perfect balance of comfort and style. I’ve bought 5 pairs of ultra boost caged and uncaged in the past 3 months. Looking forward to more colorways being released!,CBY27
5,10/17/2017,The best running shoes ever The shoe is very comfortable and easy to wear for long periods. Good for running and outdoor wear. Amazing quality long lasting. Very clean and nice looking shoes. Personally favorite shoes on the market.,CBY27

I could never find a sneaker that didn't leave my feet aching halfway through the day, until I got my first pair of ultraboosts. These are the only sneaker I know I can wear for days on end that feel like I'm walking barefoot. 10 stars.",CBY27

4,10/13/2017,"Walking on Cloud 9 Couple of weeks ago I was stuck on whether to get the triple white NMD R1 or the Triple White Ultraboost and I chose the ultraboost and my oh my, these shoes literally feel like no other. I went 1/2 size up from a 9.5 to a 10 to give my feet some space to move around and the way they feel on your feet works some wonders. I would give this all 5 stars but the boost do come with a few scratches and the delivery method is SO SLOW. Other than that, i would recommend these to anyone and the price is well worth it!",CBY27

5,10/09/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I've ever worn So, I can't say that I've tried every shoe in the world, but even if I had, it would be hard to imagine a more comfortable shoe ever made. It's like wearing my favorite, most supportive pair of socks, but with a supportive cloud attached to the sole. I wasn't a huge fan of the look at first (you know the whole styrofoam packing shell thing as the sole), but once I wore them for a day, I just don't even care anymore. Now I finally get why my dad always wore such ugly shoes. I'm used to suffering for fashion, but with all of this great new Adidas tech, I no longer have to. Comfy is the new cool for this young dad.",CBY27
5,10/09/2017,Favourite pair of shoes ever! Comfort is key with a pair of shoes and these definitely don’t disappoint.,CBY27
5,10/07/2017,"Just buy it already This has to be the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on. I came from wearing roshes but they were incredibly uncomfortable when wearing for long periods of time, especially when running even a mile. I went for a run immediately after my ultraboosts came in the mail and it made running feel effortless. If you do have a pair of roshes and they fit snug,  you should order a half size up in this shoe. You will have a little toe room but I had to compensate for the width of my foot. Other than that, amazing shoe and 10/10 would buy again.",CBY27
2,10/07/2017,Too tight with true size I think these shoes feel comfortable because they grip my feet so tightly that I have no blood circulation to actually feel my feet. Otherwise they’re nice and I would consider ordering a half size up.,CBY27

2,09/30/2017,"Not my expectation I had very high hopes for this shoe, due to the overwhelmingly high ratings for the shoe. 
When I got the shoe, I realized it was defective, with a bump on the prime knit of my left shoe. It causes irritation when I run for longer distances. It was also glued badly, causing different toe space for each shoe. The feeling that my left feet feels different from my right is very annoying. I have already returned the shoe, and I hope the next pair I get has better quality.",CBY27

4,09/28/2017,"Fantastic pair of shoes. I really like the design of the UltraBOOST, but I think you should start selling a new type of color for these shoes, Camoflage. I think that the camouflage would look absolutely fantastic on these shoes. I also think that this would boost your selling rate of these shoes because, people have to go to other websites or people to get these custom made shoes and your losing some business by not having this color. I do hope to see this in the future.",CBY27
5,09/26/2017,very pleased with my selection The shoes are amazingly light in weight and fit well around the foot.,CBY27

2,09/24/2017,"Horrible quality My son had these shoes for about 6 weeks and a hole developed on the top of the shoe and the sole is already tearing away from the fabric. He called customer service and was told sorry, your 30 days have passed to return your item. He is a high school cross country runner, not a marathon trainer-Wearing them only for cc practice. This was his third pair of boosts with no prior issues, that's why we keep buying this brand. So so disappointed in the customer service and the fact he paid for these with his own money. $180 for trainers...stand by your product, please!",CBY27
3,09/24/2017,"Very nice, one annoying flaw I really like the shoes except for one thing. The soles get dirty on the side and they don't come clean at the seams. There is no way to avoid this so you end up with shoes that look dirty right away no matter how careful you are. Otherwise great shoes for lounging or walking. Not for sports but that's ok. For me if the shoes are stylish and for walking and also expensive, I don't want them looking dirty. So unfortunately I can't recommend them.",CBY27
5,09/23/2017," Well made, so comfortable. The way it made it shows that the sneaker is so comfortable, you can also take a long walk",CBY27
5,09/21/2017,"Best purchase ever! About five months ago I purchased a pair of Adidas Ultra Boost running shoes. I saw these shoes all over social media and wanted to see what the hype was about. After doing some research, many people claimed these to be the most advanced and the most comfortable running shoes on the market. These shoes were designed for runners but I have seen many people wearing them as a fashionable shoe as well. I bought the triple white Ultra Boosts the summer after my sophomore year in college. I chose these shoes because I love the design of these shoes and I walk a lot in college so I wanted a comfortable shoe. I have discovered through a couple months of wear that durability, comfort, and style of these chose have been better than any other shoe I’ve ever purchased.

Durability
I have worn my white ultra boosts almost everyday since I’ve gotten them. I walk to all my classes in college and my campus is pretty large. Other shoes I have would either wear out on the bottoms, or I would get a hole in the shoe somewhere. Since I have had these shoes they have shown minimal wear. The tread on the bottom is practically new and the upper part of the shoe has no holes or any sort of distress. I believe these shoes will last me for quite some time. 

Comfort
These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. I wear these shoes everyday and walk a lot. Whenever I would have a long walk to class, my feet would usually start hurting. I don’t have that issue anymore with these shoes. The thick “boost” sole of the shoe absorbs each step better than any other shoe I own. Also the sock-like upper material of the shoe is very breathable and flexible. These shoes are so comfortable that sometimes I forget I’m wearing them.

Style
Along with durability and comfort, the new shoes I purchase also have to look good. This Is one of the main reasons I bought these. I love the thick white “boost” foam that runs along the bottom of the shoe. Also, the fact that the laces are separate from the shoe is a great feature that makes these shoes different from the competition. On the back of the shoe, the material comes up a bit higher creating a tab, and although this is a small feature, I think it looks great. In my opinion, the Ultra Boosts are the best looking shoe on the market.

Negatives
After wearing these shoes almost everyday for a few months I have considered these to be the best shoe I have ever purchased. I love almost everything about them, but nothing Is perfect. The sock-like upper material is excellent for comfort and breathability, but not great for any kind of cutting or fast direction changes while running. Also these shoes are priced at a firm $180. This is pretty expensive for a running shoe but I am glad I made the commitment to buying them. Also I got the triple white color way which is pretty hard to keep clean, but that is to be expected when buying all white shoes. 

All in all, these shoes are the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased. They are one of the most sought after shoes in the running and style categories. That being said, the Ultra Boosts live up their hype. Their durability, comfort, and style are better than any other shoes I’ve ever bought. If you walk/run a lot and love a fashionable shoe, I highly recommend getting the Ultra boosts.",CBY27

They are also really small for their size, and squeak like crazy. 

I can see where the comfort would be there if they fit correctly, but they do not. 

If you know you like the color then that's fine but be sure to order a size up, and prepare for squeaking.",CBY27

1,09/07/2017,"there is a hole after 7 months use These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! BUT, after a while, I have noticed that the area where the toe hits the prime knit stretches out - even when i use socks 100% of the time. I use this shoes for work in a carpeted clinic and sometimes for running in a pavement but never on trail. Then today what I thought was dirt was actually a HOLE in the primeknit. Considering that this is a $180 shoe, it should last longer than 6 months. I have sent a message to customer service and I am hoping this will fixed or refunded. Will keep you guys  posted.

2,09/01/2017,Lacking durability/quality I've been a Adidas customer for most of my life and typically go for the higher end of the line as I work out and run quite a bit. I recently purchased (lease than 1 month) the Ultraboost running shoes. 4 weeks later the top laceholerbroke on the left shoe and is almost broken on the right. The system is exactly the same as my previous Ultraboost runners but what happened to the quality.,CBY27

5,08/30/2017,"Most Underrated Color If you're a sneakerhead and Ultra Boost lover, You must add this shoe to your collection. The colorway is great for the fall season.

5,08/30/2017,"Best running shoe I have owned Great shoes but my first generation sole wore out quickly. I think they have since upgraded to a continental sole and I hear it is more durable.
Also not psyched about the current color selection which seems to cater to casual wearers and not runners. May need to go in a different direction unless new colors come out soon. I have neon green and generally prefer brighter colors and combinations.",CBY27
5,08/30/2017,"Hands down, worth it. These are the most comfortable shoes. I saw them at first and didn't buy a pair, then one was gifted to me. Pretty sure I'll exclusively buy Ultraboosts from now on. Adidas, keep this in stock! Also more colors please.",CBY27

They are EXTREMELY comfortable; have incredible support (especially in the heel area) and just look sexy to be quite honest. Whether you're running or walking, you can truly notice the shock absorbance of the shoe once your foot impacts the ground. This is the first pair of Adidas shoes I have ever bought and I'm sold for life if they keep producing shoes with this level of quality and comfort.",CBY27

5,08/25/2017,By far the best shoes I have ever worn. I recent bought my first pair of ultra boost about a month ago. I couldn't be in love with these shoes more. They are very stylish and look good with any outfit. Also a great shoe to wear to the gym. I purchased the triple whites and over time they got very dirty which happens with any pair of all white shoes. Because of that and the fact that they are just a great shoe in any category I ordered the black ones and the shipping was very fast and I couldn't be happier with them. I recommend these to everyone I know and once they try them on they're sold.,CBY27
3,08/25/2017, Everything is good but my new shoe has scuffs like this. I am sure that it is not my false and i have no idea how they are from. I hope that I will have some explaination and advices about that.,CBY27

The color pops and the boost is great all around. Plus they actually had my true size of 12.5 and I couldn't be happier. Thank you,CBY27
4,08/22/2017,"The hype is real I, like most people, was a little skeptical of how a shoe could be priced the way it is. Sure it's an investment, but from the moment I put them on they were the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Although these shoes are super comfortable, I do believe after a long time standing in them they may start to lose their signature comfort ( a little too soft if that makes sense) and also if you have them up tightly they may strain your foot. This however should not scare you from buying the shoe, the investment was very much worth it. The style and supreme comfortability make this my go-to shoe for years to come.",CBY27
4,08/21/2017,almost perfection The comfort was great but as I wore the shoe the toe area started to care in so there would be massive bumps. The bumps would press up into my left foot causing pain.,CBY27

5,08/07/2017,Great shoes I'm just sad I waited so long to buy a pair. They're amazing.,CBY27

5,08/06/2017,Best shoes ever! Second pair and well worth it! Love the color and can't beat boosts with comfort!,CBY27
4,08/06/2017,"Heel is a little narrow, everything else is perfect Love the fit, but the heels feels slim. The pure boost feels perfect and I expected this to feel similar or better but was a little let down by the ""just ok"" feel",CBY27
4,08/05/2017,"Great shoe, not the best quality One of the shoelaces was damaged
It is a great shoe, very comfortable, but a tad but expensive for their wear",CBY27

5,08/02/2017, Great show. Fits like every other ultra boost. The trace pink is so much nicer in person. Great shoe to talk around in at work and a real joy to run in.,CBY27
1,08/02/2017, The blue in the pic does not match the actual shoe very off and the size was off by 1/2,CBY27
5,08/02/2017,One of the best 3.0 colorways. Obviously ultra Boost are extremely comfortable. I'm a huge fan of this colorway (Trace Pink).,CBY27

5,08/01/2017,"very comfortable!!! love the product but they need to make more colors and a little bit more ""Hip"" little nerdy but the most comfortable shoes i have bought. Have bad feet and this shoe is GREAT on comfort!!!",CBY27

5,08/01/2017,UltraBoost are in a league of their own There are not many sneakers that come even close to the overall comfort and quality of Ultraboost. Hands down my favorite sneaker,CBY27
4,07/31/2017,"AMAZING SHOE BUT LITTLE EXPANSIVE I loved the product it was amazing very comfortable but there is one down side the shoe is a little on the espansive side it is 180 retail in my
Opinion they should be sold at around 140-150",CBY27
5,07/30/2017,super comfy shoes The best comfortable shoes Adidas has come out with,CBY27
5,07/30/2017, This shoe is very comfortable. The mid sole absorbs the shocks between the foot and the ground. It reduces the pressure to your feet on every steps. The weight of the shoe is very light as well.,CBY27
5,07/30/2017,"Unreal comfort. Fits your foot with almost sock like feel. Unparalleled cushion in the heels, great shoe. Not to mention the styles.",CBY27
4,07/30/2017,Awesome but small shoe Great shoe and I love the cushioning. They run a little small for me. I have to wear one size up. Hopefully one day we can get a lighter ultraboost as well.,CBY27

5,07/27/2017,"Ultra Boosts are by far are the all-around best shoe out currently. These shoes are so comfortable.  They feel like therapeutic pillows for your feet, plus feel great on the ankles.  Very easy on the knees while being active.  You can wear them tied or casually untied, and they still fit well.  The construction/design improves with every model, and the colorways are sweet.",CBY27
5,07/27/2017,Crazy comfortable running shoes I love then and now I want to own all the different colours,CBY27

5,07/20/2017,One of the best ever. It's very comfortable  which is one of the best features of Ultraboost. It will always my favourite shoe ever.,CBY27
5,07/20/2017,Keep them coming! 2nd pair of ultra and they are even better than my first!,CBY27
3,07/19/2017,Poorly made will wear away continental tire in 3 months. Really adidas?second pair n it keeps busting through to the boost. How is this quality? Bottom tread wears out after 3months!Unacceptable. My first pair did the same thing. I walk a bunch but these are made for running. Are u running indoors on padded floors because tread will wear away quick on the street. Adidas should offer a warrantee that the continental has to last strong at least 6months. Why wouldn't u just make that thicker?Just because they're comfortable doesn't mean the soul should wear out so fast. And i rotate my sneakers. I'm so heated-adidas and their technology need an upgrade on the souls. Weak craftsmanship. Only have a month return policy-obviously they should last a month!Ridiculous,CBY27
4,07/19/2017,Not worth the money They are comfortable shoes but the soles come out when you are walking with them which can be very annoying.,CBY27
5,07/19/2017,"Most comfortable shoe ever! Super amazing shoe,but needs to be a bit more available.",CBY27

5,07/16/2017,"Amazing shoe, but sizing on this colour is different Perfect casual running shoe and training shoe. For some reason this colourway runs almost a full size big. Suggest going at least half a size up from regular ultra boost size",CBY27
5,07/15/2017,Best runner shoe on the market I love these shoes!!! The color is very vibrant and looks very high tech. If you want to use this show for running it will never let you down!,CBY27
5,07/13/2017,Great shoe but the quality wasn't there for the price. I absolutely love these shoes. I wear them almost everyday. They. are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn. The only issue I have is that the lace hole on the cage ripped. Now they are unwearable. I am very disappointed because I only wore them for a couple months and took fairly good care of them.,CBY27
5,07/11/2017, This is my first pair of Adidas Ultra boost I got the khaki they're awesome very comfortable at first I thought it was all hype it turns out to be these and got to be one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn I definitely will be buying more thanks Adidas I'm a new fan,CBY27

5,07/03/2017,"Overall awesome shoe only wear ultra boosts since I first tried one... Slightly too big for thin socks but great for regular and slightly thicker socks, was hoping for a more distinguishable pattern, awesome feel on the feet like walking on clouds or marshmallows, hope the tread lasts longer on previous models of ultra boosts the shoe itself has next to no wear but my tread has been worn off!  PS I don't drag my feet I walk normally...",CBY27

5,11/26/2017,The best shoes I’ve ever bought! I’ve been researching my next pair of shoes for awhile and stumbled upon these online. Based on all the positive reviews I saw I decided to order them. I have extreme pain when walking in my feet and knees. These shoes are seriously the most supportive and cushioned I’ve ever felt. It literally feels like you are walking on a cloud. Well worth the high price.,KEH54
5,10/19/2017,I love them! Its honestly like running on clouds when running in these shoes. Every time I hit the track or roads its like a perfect cushion. The only thing I have against them is when they get wet they are HEAVY and they soak up all the water they can but otherwise they are great!,KEH54
5,09/17/2017,"This is my second pair! Love this shoe! Very comfortable, fits like a sock. I would recommend going down half a size.",KEH54
1,08/08/2017,"Good when new but didn't last 3 months the sole has cracked on my 3 month old ""ULTRABOOST UNCAGED SHOES"" and that happened twice with Adidas not even bothering with the pair that I returned. So that meant I paid $360 for one pair of shoes that did not last even half a year.",KEH54
5,06/30/2017,"SO cute, so comfortable, in love!! omg amazing! I feel like I am running on a cloud. I was skeptical to buy these at first because I wasn't sure if they would be supportive enough. They are amazing. I have the original ultra boosts and I think I like these more. I've only been on two runs in them but I cannot wait until my next run! So comfortable and so cute, I've gotten multiple compliments on them. Love!!",KEH54
5,06/20/2017,UNCAGED ULTRA IS SUPER NICE! I purchased my GF this shoe for her birthday. The Uncaged is probably her favorite boost yet. The black multi-colored pops even tho its not a bright color. Looks great on foot and is very easy to put on!,KEH54

5,05/03/2017,"perfect! I am not into rubbery shoes until I had to wear one due to my heel spur, the Uncaged is the best.",KEH54

5,02/10/2017,"Best Running Shoes I have Purchased My Uses for the Adidas Ultraboost Uncaged Shoes:
Currently I use these shoes for running and working out at the gym. I work out in the gym on average one hour and 15 minutes per day, also I generally run roughly 15 miles per week. The sort of conditions that I run on are gravel, asphalt, and grass. Also wear these shoes when going to class for 8+ hours per day.

Comfortability:
For the uses I have stated above the Ultraboost shoes are an easy 5/5 for comfortability. I have tried many different types of running shoes, primarily from Nike and Adidas, but none have been able to apply appropriate support for the differing terrains that I work out on. Though for the Ultraboosts that I recently purchased, even when running on large gravel a sizeable portion of the impact is absorbed. Overall comfortability is the best that I have experienced from any running shoes I have purchased in the past.

Durability:
If you are like me then you tend to go through quite a few pairs of shoes per year. Like with most shoes you will likely try to keep them at least somewhat clean for as long as possible. This will likely require you to wash the shoes more than once. While most other shoes in the past that you have tried washing will begin to wear out after one or two washes the Ultraboosts will still remain looking nearly brand new. I have washed mine 3 times already and they still look almost brand new through all of the mud and other stains that I have gotten on them. Overall durability is outstanding and the new shoe look has lasted the longest with the Ultraboosts.

Support:
For running on uneven ground especially you likely will want plenty of support from your shoes. The arch support that you get with the Ultraboosts is by far the best that I have experienced from other running shoes that I have tried. For ankle support for someone with weaker ankles like myself it is somewhat lacking. This can be corrected just by wearing a light ankle brace and I use one for all of my running shoes anyway. Overall for support I would still consider it one of the top running shoes.

Ending Summary:
Overall if you are looking for a durable, comfortable, and supportive shoe you should really give the Ultraboosts a try. It is a great investment for the average runner and will last you a long time.",KEH54
5,02/07/2017,"Great shoe and that color! Let's start with this is an Ultra Boost so what else we can say?  Comfortable check, Primeknit check, but the thing that shock me was the color (Crystal White / Tactile Blue / Easy Blue).  This was a present for my wife and let me tell you that she loved it!  Specially the color, the pictures don't do justice to it.  So overall is a very nice shoe and a very prefect color.  Great job once again Adidas!",KEH54
4,02/02/2017, I like the style and the bright color of the shoes.,KEH54

4,01/03/2017,"Comfortable and stylish, but run large I heard great things about these shoes and was looking forward to wearing them! However I'm 8.5 and that size was too large for me. The shoes were also quite wide without any arch support. So unfortunately I had to return them...",KEH54
5,12/30/2016,Best shoes I've ever owned! I love these shoes! I got them based on a reccomendation by a friend and I'm glad I did. i didn't feel like I had to break them in like I do with all of the other shoes I've ever gotten. they fit perfectly and were extremely comfortable right off the bat! I wish they had more colors to choose from because I would definitely get another pair if they had a blue/green or a purple option.,KEH54
5,12/30/2016, Fab running shoes super comfortable very light on your feet,KEH54

2,12/08/2016,"Perfect except not going to last for long. At the beginning, I loved wearing them so much. They are perfect except the fact that they don't last long. I used wear them and now after couple months of usage, the shoes started to tear on the bottom and the fabric isn't durable. For $180, I expect to have a shoe for at least a year!",KEH54
5,12/08/2016,"BEST. PURCHASE. EVER. The BEST pair of shoes I have ever owned! These shoes are worth the money! I never take them off, and when I do.... I miss them on my feet. By far, the greatest shoe ever invented. Thank you Adidas!",KEH54

5,10/20/2016,"Amazed. I have been wearing Nike for so long. Always, whether it be cleats or training shoes or running shoes, it has been Nike. I decided to buy a pair of ultra boosts because I wanted to branch out for the first time. Let me tell you, I am SO HAPPY that I decided to go with the ultra boosts and not a pair of nike racers. Because these are the most comfortable** pair of shoes  I have ever worn. This beats flyknits, racers, roshes, any pair of Nike shoes I have worn. Seriously, best shoes ever.",KEH54
5,10/19/2016,"One of a kind! These are my first Ultra Boosts and they are fantastic! very confortable and cool looking design. The only thing... Adidas should suggest what kind of socks to wear, because some them can bother with the ankle collar.",KEH54
1,10/16/2016,The shoes did not look as sleek as the picture and poor quality. The material tore the first day of wearing them I did not like the material it seemed cheaply made and unraveled after one wearing,KEH54

The only con is the price. It is a little high, but definitely worth it.",KEH54

5,10/08/2016,"Comfortable stylish and practical I haven't had a decent pair of tennis shoes in awhile. After I put these on it was apparent what I was missing out on, they are incredibly comfortable and I now wear them everyday because the style is modern and nice as well. They pair well with my everyday outfits and a few people have actually mistaken them for Yeezy's which I don't mind at all.",KEH54
3,10/04/2016,Would have got another shoe if had know this would occur. The back of the sock on the shoe digs into my skin and opens wounds around my achilles. I had to start putting bandages or wraps in this area to protect my skin!,KEH54
4,10/01/2016,"Could be better engineered Very comfortable and stable ride. Somehow, not very quick and easy to put on.

5,09/27/2016,My most comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is lightweight yet super comfortable. I would recommend this shoe. The sock liner style also keeps turf pellets from getting into shoe. Added bonus. Have received lots of compliments. I think I may get the black pair too.,KEH54
3,09/25/2016," This shoes are so much comfortable, light and very cool.I love it.",KEH54

5,09/19/2016,My feet have found their happy place Perfection -- I've worn the original Ultraboost or the UltraboostST in my past three marathons. Something made be decide to try #uncaged. BEST. SHOE. EVER. Has everything the others do in cushion but my entire foot has truly found its happy place -- also affords much better opportunity for ankle flexion ... same sole as the other models which do fine in rain (e.g. BOS 2015).

5,09/09/2016,"My favorites! I absolutely love these shoes! I had surgery on my right ankle last November and I have noticed a huge difference in my walk. It makes my foot feel very stable and balanced. They almost have a bouncy like feel to them in the heel and they are super light. I'd say the only thing I really don't like are the 3 stripes design on the top of the foot, but other than that they're super cute aswell! So glad I purchased, these are worth every penny in my opinion.",KEH54

5,09/01/2016,"Best show ever for a Combat Veteran and his comfort! Never in my life have I wore Adidas, until now! I didn't believe all the hype, so I 1st bought the all White Boost NMD_R1. Very comfortable and I love them, my size 10 fit perfectly. In the sneaker community, I was told the Ultra Boost are even more comfortable than the NMD's. So I bought a pair of 2.0's and absolutely LOVE them. I haven't taken my Ultra Boost off in months now! I am a true believer now, so much that I sold my entire Nike Air Jordan collection (35 pair) in the attempt to buy the next best Adidas called the Yeezy Boost 350 Pirate Black. Although I still haven't been able to buy any Yeezy Boost 350 in a size 10, I am looking forward to the next Yeezy Boost to be released via Adidas.com so I can hopefully have the opportunity to buy a pair!",KEH54

5,08/27/2016,worth the money for the most part. The style is quite impressive but the comfortability in the shoe is quite comfortable... it feels as if most of the time I'm barefooted ! the only thing is i wish the continental tires at the sole of the foot would last a bit longer than it does.,KEH54

1,08/19/2016,"most comfortable but non durable sole shoes ever made i was blown away at first every step felt a bouncey responsiveness now it feels like the foam has lost it ""boost"" and the soles wear out fast with just walking not worth the $200 i spent",KEH54

4,08/18/2016," Don't get me wrong I love these shoes. They look great, and they are the most comfortable shoes I have tried, my issue with the shoes is that wearing them cause me serious knee pains, which I'm glad to report that after a few days not wearing the shoes it gets better. But as soon as I wear them again the pain is back.. I am not sure whether it is an issue with my pair of shoes,This could be just affecting me, but it makes me not able to wear them anymore.",KEH54

5,08/17/2016,"These rock! I have long been an ultra boost fan, but these are off the chain.  I love the sock-like fit, and they are beyond comfortable to run it.  Super super stylish, I got the light grey and I love the subtle 3 stripes on the toe! Adidas knocked it out of the park with these.",KEH54
5,08/16/2016,"These shoes are good for ANYTHING I LOVE these shoes. I'm a fitness instructor and I only buy Adidas shoes. I have both the Ultra Boost and Ultra Boost Uncaged for running. The Uncaged has more cushioning on the ball of the foot vs. the 1st gen. Ultra Boost. On the 1st gen. there is a slight forward lean (less forefoot cushioning) that assists with forward propulsion while running. Since the Uncaged has more forefoot cushioning, that forward lean is gone, but I also love the extra cushioning. The 1st gen. is a little more snug in the toe box, where as the Uncaged has just a little bit more room. I love the sock fit at the ankle and the padding inside the heel cup feels amazing. The Continental rubber sole also provides a more noticeable grip on the ground over the 1st gen, but I believe you can get the Continental rubber sole on the 1st gen. also. You can't go wrong with the 1st gen. or the Uncaged. Both are amazing. I personally own 2 pair (1st gen & Uncaged), I have bought my fiance 2 pair (both 1st gen) and I recently bought my 15 year old daughter a pair (1st gen). She started band camp and was using a different pair of running shoes that left her with blisters on her toes after marching for 5 hours. She switched to her Ultra Boost and I haven't heard one complaint about her feet hurting. These shoes are good for ANYTHING.",KEH54
4,08/16/2016,"The Perfect Shoe For Everyday Wear! The ultraboost series is amazing! So comfortable and definitely great for everyday wear (I feel like I'm walking on clouds). It is an all rounder for me, excelling in comfort, design and definitely stylish. These shoes are a must have in everyone's shoe collection!",KEH54
4,08/14/2016," So comfortable and fashionable
It is perfect fit to my feet",KEH54
5,08/14/2016,"The best comfort and  aesthetics on the market. I love this product because not only does it offer incredible comfort but after each run, my ankle is a little sensitive. With the new elastic band around the ankle, which is pretty tight I might add, feels amazing to have these on after a run or even during a run.",KEH54
5,08/14/2016," Shoes are perfect.

5,08/10/2016,"Best purchase- SO WORTH THE MONEY!!! Purchased these in store last week as I needed a new shoe for running/uni and I have to say that these are the most comfortable shoe ever, even more so than my superstars which I absolutely adore. I did end up going down half a size due to length however the width was absolutely perfect. The material is super soft and breathable and the sock strap is tight enough to keep the shoe in place but not too tight that it cuts into my ankle.  Great job adidas!!!",KEH54

5,08/04/2016,Most comfortable shoes ever. By far the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I have unhealed stress fractures and fallen arches from years of pounding from gymnastics and typically my feet ache unbearably after 30 minutes or so of activity but with these I can be on my feet comfortably all day and even run moderate distances without pain. I love them so much that I have been trying to snap them up in every color whenever I see my size in stock (which is not often since they are so popular). I'm a bit of a sneaker collecter - I have hundreds of pairs - but these are probably my all-time favorites.,KEH54
5,08/02/2016,"Sneaker head approved. I've been meaning to get my hands on some ultra boost and the fact that they were primeknit it as well had me so excited! I am a shoe lover so the moment, these shoes launched, I was on the website. My usual size ran out, 6.5. So I settled for a 7. I'm glad I did. The ankle area is very snug. Almost too snug when you first wear them. They need to be broken in a bit. Go half a size up to be comfy! They're so comfortable. I fell like I could walk or run in these for days.",KEH54

I'm hooked with these shoes, plus the thing I love the most about these is that Adidas made men's and women's sizes!

After having read a good amount of reviews (as I was choosing between this shoe and a couple others)I felt pretty confident when I made my decision and purchase. But holy cow, these shoes are even more incredible than I could have expected. I worked out in them for the first time today and it felt like I was walking on air.

3,07/20/2016,"Comf! Just weird soles Let me start by saying these shoes are so comfy! Seriously. I have really wide feet but the prime knit is tight enough to feel secure but not too tight to where they are sore. However, one weird thing I have noticed is that it seems like the boost sole is thicker in my right shoe than my left, after a few weeks they are so comfortable for my feet but if I wear them too long my hips get sore from the unevenness. Love them, just wish the sole was even.",KEH54

5,07/13/2016,"A gift for my wife, she loves them! My wife is a very avid runner, she hated the Brooks Ghost 9 she previously wore.  These are really the shoe she was searching for.  A more comfortable sole than the Nike Free, but more lightweight than the Brooks Ghost.  Basically one of the best lightweight runners on the market.",KEH54
3,07/12/2016, The shoes overall look great but when I wore them without socks the back part starting making A blister on the back is my foot. I think the tab comes up too high. At times the fabric feels too tight around my foot so much so that it tingles. Other than that the shoes are super comfortable to walk in. I'm hoping that by wearing socks I'll eliminate the blister issue and that the shoes will stretch out just a bit.,KEH54
3,07/12/2016," The shoe is really great quality. Very well produced. However, the sock liner was too tight for my liking. I felt like it would have rubbed my ankles raw when running in them, so I returned them.",KEH54
5,07/12/2016,"Best Boost ever I have owned several versions of Boost.  This is the best one yet.  Light, super comfortable, and the best use of the amazing Boost material yet.  I so wish Adidas would make just one version with zero or 4 heel drop.",KEH54

5,07/11/2016," Love the ultra boost, so the uncaged version is great as well. Just getting used to the sock portion of the shoe hugging my ankle.",KEH54
3,07/11/2016,"Must wear higher socks for that Saw-like stitch. Everything you can ask for in a UB, sock-like feel and no cage tightness for us wide footers. However, if you plan on actually wearing these for running beware of the back stitch at the ankle opening.  After running for about a mile, you can start to really feel it rubbing on the Achilles. Changed to a higher sock and you won't notice it but the fact that I have to adjust my sock preference for a $180+ shoe is not what I wanted. That one stitch is what bothers me the most so unless you wear socks with heel tabs or plan to put band aids at the back then these are good to go.  But I will be returning these since I use UB ST and the adizero prime for most runs and I don't need another ""casual"" UB since I have the 1st generation on rotation.",KEH54
5,07/11/2016,Love these! Amazing feel - perfect cushion - should've sized up 1/2 size though.,KEH54
5,07/11/2016,"Most comfortable shoe ever Absolutely loved the uncaged, unfortunately it ran about one shoe size too big. It was my first time ordering their ultraboosts so I can't say if it was this particular shoe that ran big or the brand.",KEH54

5,07/11/2016,"Better than NMD This product is very comfortable. It is good for running and walking. It used the highest boost technology for runners to improve speed. By the fashion way, black and grey primeknit is very cool. I love that colour. The only thing that I don't like is that the three stripes at the front. I hope adidas can remove them.",KEH54

5,07/10/2016," A++++++++++++++++++++++++

Must buy 

Super shoe!!",KEH54
5,07/10/2016,"Best ultra boosts ever The ultra boost uncaged absolutely surpassed all my expectations in comfort, fit, support and style! The sock like fit was perfect and held the shoe in place without any uncomfortable rubbing at the heel, which I found with my Tubular Virals/

I could walk, run and train for days on the ultra boost sole - lightweight, bouncy and responsive. The slight curved geometry lends perfectly to my natural stride and helps cushion impact on runs.

As for style, the core black colourway is a hard one to beat. Coordinates with anything and everything, but I particularly love the gold lace tips for detail.

If there's any stock left, definitely buy a pair. If not, I feel for you.",KEH54
5,07/09/2016,I'm happy to get it More comfortable than others . It's good for running,KEH54
5,07/09/2016,Best shoe This is awesome shoe. I like this shoe so much. I would like to buy another colour.,KEH54
5,07/09/2016," Very comfortable and perfect fit
good for runner and perfect for training",KEH54
5,07/09/2016,"Perfect. Essentially the perfect everyday shoe.
The Ultra Boost makes every stride effortless.
The Primeknit is just like wearing a breathable sock.
The Continental rubber is super durable.
Worth every cent.",KEH54
5,07/09/2016,"So far it is the best product I bought from adidas Knitprim version of ultra boost, combine tow things i love :-)",KEH54
5,07/09/2016,Beyond nice. Comfortable doesn't even begin to describe. Buy these shoes now!,KEH54
5,07/09/2016,Best shoes ever! Its really comfortable. I will recommend it to my friends,KEH54
4,07/09/2016,"Good Very comfortable for wearing and nice.

5,07/09/2016,Great shoes Very comfortable and great quality pair of shoes. Great price.,KEH54
5,07/08/2016,"Great buy Very comfortable, feel like huge sock with excellent support.",KEH54
3,07/05/2016,"Sock cuff not great; stripes design = disaster Go with the original. The NMD-like sock cuff isn't very comfortable and the implementation (design, placement) of the three stripes is pretty awful. Why impose these new ""features"" when people were already clamoring for the uncaged approach they loved in all the collaborations? I will say the inner support is fantastically clever but since more people generally (and sneakerheads specifically) would be interested in this as a lifestyle shoe based on established uncaged aesthetics, why mess with it? The stripes just look so lame. I sent my black pair back immediately.",KEH54
5,07/02/2016,Best shoes ever these shoes are amazing. So happy with my purchase. So comfortable and look amazing. Only things for me are they are a bit wide at the feet and looked a little blue when i received them. They also don't have much of an arch for my foot so I'll probably need a insole.,KEH54
5,06/30/2016,"Good quality with reasonable price I like it coz it's really comfortable. Suitable for shopping, casual wear and lighth sports! Also with reasonable price.",KEH54
5,12/03/2017,was surprised how comfortable they were love the style and the look of this show. feels great while running or just walking. another hidden gem!,CCX10
5,11/30/2017,SOOO much better then I expected They size super big (the difference between wearing a fashion sock and a wool sock). They are the most comfortable shoes I can remember buying plus they look great.,CCX10
5,11/20/2017,"Diverse shoes for any situation. My first wear of these was for about a 3 mile hike in Hong Kong's Dragon's Back trail. These shoes handled the stairs, rocks, roots, paved road, and dirt road like champs. No slipping and was able to grip everything. I have wide, sensitive feet and these did the job. Definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn. Trust me, I have never written a shoe review until this one.",CCX10
1,11/09/2017,"Uncomfortable and not water resistant at all. Poor tongue design and awkward seam make these very uncomfortable.
Bought these for rainy days and they are not even remotely water resistant.",CCX10
4,11/09/2017,"First adidas purchase on a shoe. Really impressed, honestly the boost is legit. Please make getting yeezy a and Pharrell fair for everyone Love everything about it. Boost makes waking easier on my knees.",CCX10
5,11/04/2017,Super comfy kicks. This shoe is very well put together. Comfort is unbelievable. Might even be better than Ultra Boost.,CCX10
5,11/04/2017,Buy it. Very comfortable and looks great.I love it because it's simple.,CCX10
4,10/20/2017,"Pure boost 3 was better This is a great shoe. I think the comfort and whole shoe dynamic is a step down for me compared to the pure boost 3. If I could but more of the 3s, I would do that. The exclusion of an insole left me to buy my own separately and is a disappointment. This is the first time a burrito tongue has worked for me. I wish Adidas would make this in pure black with no color texture, for work. 
These have the same outsoles as the non atr pure boost models. So I'm not sure why they call them atr and not all weather. 
Overall, a comfortable shoe that's better than all other brands because of boost.",CCX10
4,10/17/2017,Very nice shoe- where is insole? I like the shoe but where is the insole? I think it's kind of cheap to make such an expensive shoe and have the wearer feel the tracks on the inside of the shoe.  I feel the older model of pureboost was better than this.,CCX10
5,10/11/2017,My 1st Boost shoes Really comfortable from the second I put these on.,CCX10
4,10/09/2017,Pretty great product Love these shoes! They’re great for running and look awesome!,CCX10

This is my first pair of Adidas and I can't wait to buy more.",CCX10
5,09/29/2017,"I have a flatfoot.. tested a lot of shoes and finally bought these pureboost all terain... must say it's one of the most comfortable shoes I ever had. Why yes:
Comfortable
Durable
Looks fashionable

Why not:
They are a bit large.. but it's easy to adjust to that",CCX10
5,09/28/2017,Really great buy This shoe is very comfortable and light weight shoes.,CCX10

5,12/06/2017,Excellent Choice for casual and running Very comfortable and light weight.Highly Recommend .,CCX21
3,11/19/2017,"Good looking shoe. Like, don’t love it. The black Stella McCartney boosts are super cute and I love the style but they make my already large size 9 feet look bigger. more importantly they irritate my inner ankle on the left foot - leaving a little red sore each time I wear them :(",CCX21
5,11/17/2017,"Best purchase ever!!!! I Absolutely Love Love Love my Stella McCartney Ultraboost!!!! Super comfortable. Wore them all over Europe, NYC, Vegas. Use them for work, run & play. They are sooo cute with the sparkles and I get so many compliments. Best purchase ever! Highly recommend!",CCX21

5,11/04/2017,Great shoes!!! So sleek!!! Perfect fit and enough cushion. I just bought 2 NMDs and 1 ultraboost this year and they are all comfortable. I will never buy any other brands from now on. Adidas is the best!!!,CCX21
5,10/31/2017," Once you wear Ultraboosts, no other shoe compares. Ultraboosts are the most comfortable shoes ever!",CCX21
5,10/30/2017,"The prettiest kicks! They are very comfortable and pretty!  They are true to size.  They don't run big at all, if anything, they're more on the narrow side.  For comparison,  I wear a 6 in NMDs but 6.5 in these boost.",CCX21
5,10/28/2017," True to size, very comfortable and stylish. It’s good for training and running but too soft for zumba dancing.",CCX21
5,10/28/2017,"Definitely worth the investment! I basically only wear NMD's and must have purchased about 12 pairs alone this year so far because of the comfort along with colors and styles. However my cousin told me that I had to try the Ultraboost because the comfort was much better than the NMDs. So I finally bit the bullet because I figured since we will be going to Vegas to attend the SEMA Show since we usually walk about 30 miles or so over a 3 day span. When I first tried them on, I must say that my feet have never felt like they were on clouds before. The support and comfort is nothing like I've ever experienced before! Yes they may on the more pricey side but it's so worth! The colors are just too cute and you can basically wear it with anything. I'm already looking into purchasing my next pair! I'm hoping they will come out with more colors.",CCX21
5,10/26/2017,Super stylish I keep on  getting compliments about these shoes and my God they are so comfy,CCX21

1,10/07/2017,"Awful quality - very comfy I bought these when they were full price about 3.5 months ago, (26th May 2017). They were and are incredibly comfortable and stylish, and I wore these around the office (aka, I wasn't doing anything that would damage the shoe at a faster rate). I noticed a hole in the top of the shoe fabric  last night. I unfortunately do not have the receipt but will be popping into the store to see what I can do about this as they are clearly faulty and when I bought them, they had a 1 year warranty. Will be going in with my bank statement as proof of purchase. Not impressed.",CCX21

It also is comfortable to wear while doing body weight exercises along with weight lifting dealing with your upper body.

5,09/17/2017,My husband loves the shoes and wears them everytime he goes out. The shoes are perfect and can be worn in almost every casual occasion. It was a pleasant surprise to see that the 'flaps' are not like the other regular shoes.
