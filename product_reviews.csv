4002178_M,3,08/15/2017,"too small It was the second pair of this model I have ordered in exactly the same size. The shoes, however, feel at least 1/2 size too small even though the first pair fits perfectly. Very disappointed as I'm not able to wear them and can't return them either.",92123050
4002178_M,5,07/10/2017, I used to love the Adios 2.0 and tried these and can't fault them either. I've done about 160 miles of running in them and will buy another pair when they're discounted on sale.,89969398
4002178_M,2,07/08/2017, Too tight around the toes. The most uncomfortable Adidas I have ever purchased.,89918548
4002178_M,5,06/22/2017,"Really quick and light, it's like you aren't wearing shoes I customised my own to match with my kit. It has my name in them too which I like. The main problem was picking the width, I contacted Adidas for advise and guidance on this and after a short period of conversing, they said they don't have a guide. I opted for the medium ones. These are really good, light and quick trainers, I am looking forward to racing in these. I have noticed small part of the sole has already fallen off after less than 50 miles.",89061405
4002178_M,2,05/23/2017,"Unhappy Not happy at all, definitely half a size too small which makes them unwearable, squashing my toes at the end.",86923123
4002178_M,4,05/22/2017,Great running shoe that's a bit too small. Size up 1/2 size Great running shoe that could be perfect my making the toe box a bit wider. Need to size up 1/2 size in order to get enough width.,86844513
4002178_M,5,05/13/2017,"Worth the money, glad I bought them This was my first custom shoe and I'm so happy I made the purchase. Very rare for me to find shows that fit do well, and the ability to do a unique design is fun.",86453275

4002178_M,5,03/24/2017,"Best running shoes i've had in years I bought these shoes for casual wear but also to work out in occasionally. Used to run a lot, now I'm mostly higher intensity lift/crossfit where i need to more stability. I started doing more running to train for a race. Let me tell you, these shoes are light, feel great in just moderate runs and speed work. Huge fan. Will buy another pair. Oh, and i've gotten a lot of compliments on the shoe itself.",83293893

4002178_W,1,02/26/2017,color sample was way off I ordered this shoe because i loved the displayed blush pink color. However when I ordered them they came out much more of a neon salmon color and it was nothing like I expected. I would have never ordered the shoe if the online color was portrayed more accurately. I'm very dissapointed. The neon of the shoes don't totally show up in the picture i took but you can still tell it is far off from the online sample.,82209445

But I am very disappointed with the quality for how much I paid. The soles are much bigger than represented and for some reason the sole of my right shoe makes a loud squeak and it will not go away!! It's like it starts sticking to the ground and squeaks. Idk how to fix it! If anyone knows how to please reply.",91261687

The shoes were great the shock red on my computer looked red, but in person looks more pink.  Worn once and boxed them back up.  It was my fault for not checking more into ""shock red""",97701942

4002435_W,1,08/31/2017,Lack of colour options Adidas Superstar RT colour options are very poor they need to add more colour options to their tongue logo/superstar logo & sock liner.,92839226
4002435_W,5,08/29/2017,I get compliments every time i wear them. People dont believe I custom designed them. My shoe looka exactly like I designed. Only thing i wish I could do is change colors of each stripe. Also i wish there was more variety in colors. Im making another pair now!,92751981

4002435_W,2,06/07/2017,"Unsatisfied due to manufacturing error I ordered these to wear in the Pride Parade because I always wear Adidas in the parade. I ordered gold metallic stripes and a gold metallic tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar 80s. Somehow they made a manufacturing error and put the Black Gold tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar RTs. Also, the personalized engraving is so faint it's barely visible. Hopefully, Adidas will rectify this situation for me and then I will revise my review. But even then, I will never have a new pair on time to wear in the Pride Parade. Not good.",87912654

4002435_W,4,01/20/2017," Nice. I do love the ""Scarlet"" color. However, not a huge fan of the toe matching the base. It doesn't quite look right, and the difference in materials seems to be the reason. I love the chunky, rounded aesthetic of the toe, but personally, I wish the toe material matched the base material for a more uniform look. This is probably fine if you prefer to keep the toe linked to the outsole, and not the base as I wanted to.",79021076

GIV93,4,11/19/2016,Best adidas shoe right now I love the look and comfort of the shoe but it is a half size to big and the materials are hard to clean if you watch out were you step and order the correct size amazing shoe.,75534067

GIV93,4,11/17/2016,"Great looking shoe. Lovely looking shoe, I'm not a runner, bought them because I liked the look of them. They aren't as comfortable as Ultraboosts, but nothing is really. The material used is like a breathable neoprene, so it is very soft and stretchy. The shoes are slightly narrow, so if you have wide feet, maybe order your normal Adidas size.",75172805

GIV93,4,08/18/2016,"Would recommend for running, aesthetics but not for hours of walking. I would say these shoes aesthetically look amazing! I'm a Personal Trainer and found these shoes to be uncomfortable after 2 hours of use. My feet starting to get sore, I do have flat feet so that doesn't help. I only use them for walking purposes as I'm back and forth in the gym. These shoes are meant for running so just for that type of use they would probably be amazing as they have a really nice firm bounce/response to them.
If you are looking for a nice looking shoe, def would recommend these. In terms of wearing them for hours on end, I don't think they will fill the role of a ""comfort shoe"".",70103003
GIV93,4,08/17/2016,It isn't ultra boosts but it's not a trashy shoe either. It looks really nice and is really versatile meaning that you can wear it casually as well as to work out.,70089317

GIV93,4,08/06/2016," People with slightly wider feet may want to go a half size up as these shoes are very snug and wrap around your foot for a secure sock like fit, overall it is a good comfortable shoe with good support with amazing cushioning from the Bounce material in the mid-sole. The mesh on the upper feels very soft to the touch and seems thick enough for it to be durable. However, as this has a material which appear to be hard to clean once it gets dirty so I would recommend applying some protective spray on it to keep it looking fresh!",69565131

GUA47,4,11/25/2016,They seem good but are bigger than expected. I'm in the navy and ordered these (size 10.5) online and got them just in time before I go out to sea.

GUA47,5,11/17/2016,"Best bang for your buck This shoe is amazing. I own an ultraboost shoe and of course comfort is the best. This is not far behind. I got the triple black and it is good as running shoe,trainer and casual wear. I was skeptical on going down half a size.

GUA47,4,09/27/2016,"Adidas comfort is unmatched. I have been an adidas customer for quite some time and you guys continue to give us great products. Pure boost, ultraboost, stan smith, and now the alphabounce. Great shoes. I just wish I could get my hands on a pair of yeezy boost, it is very difficult to secure a pair due to the popularity and people using ATC services. I would love to add those shoes to my collection of great adidas products. I used to wear other brands and now I strictly wear the three stripes.",72086322
GUA47,5,09/27/2016," Comfortable and great looking shoes. Had some pain from the left shoe rubbing against ankle joint that lasted four days until the shoe stretched out. I've decided that it's not a serious problem and it may have just been that one shoe. Overall, I'm very happy.",72085425

GUA47,5,09/24/2016,Definetly worth the price. Very stylish. Everyone at my school thought they were cool. Very comfortable for about 12 hours then you start to feel the pressure on the side of your foot and the ball of your foot. The grip on the bottom of the shoe wears away a bit but other than that they are pretty durable and underrated.,71891879
GUA47,5,09/24/2016,Extremely flexible shoes. Some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn for working out. These shoes are not stiff. They are very flexible and allow your feet to bend naturally in any way. This makes them perfect for running.,71882359
GUA47,5,09/24/2016,"Stealthy and aggressive look The overall appearance is stealth-like. I purchased the all black pair. They look terrific. I run 12 in Nikes and I know Nike runs a bit big so I got 11.5 for Adidas. The shoes fit incredibly snug. The safari print is very subtle so it does not look too girly. 

I am taking one star off because of the neoprene material they used. Neoprene as a material similar to that of a surf suit. I've just had the pair a week, but I feel it is a type of material that will fade in the sun and get frayed when I am doing more of my intensive workouts. 

Again, the shoe is amazing as a whole. I am just a little weary of the top portion material choice. 

Lastly, Adidas, make these in Orange, or Red, or military colors. They'd look AMAZING!",71823807
GUA47,5,09/23/2016,"perfect shoe for comfort style and doesn't hurt the pocket. Besides the amazing fresh new design , the comfort is amazing. I own some of the Ultra boosts and although the bounce doesn't have Boost , it's really up there in terms of the comfort. And the price tag is even more amazing. All shoes should cost this much lol",71701516
GUA47,5,09/23/2016,Best runner in my opinion. Planning on buying another pair. Best runners i have ever bought. They are comfy and great for work!,71685334
GUA47,5,09/23/2016,Excellent value !!! What a great running shoe for the price ! This is what the ultra boost should have been. The Alphabounce is a real comfortable shoe with nice rebound. These are  a more firm feel compared to any shoe with the Boost material but they have a good feel of their own. The upper seamless material is very comfortable. Not as restrictive as the techfit in the 1st and 2nd gen energy boost and not as tight as the ultra boost. It has just the right amount of secure and firm snug fit with out restricting the movement of your foot and it has a better vent system as well. I have 3 pairs of Alphabounce each in a different color,71683941

GUA47,5,09/11/2016,"LOVE THIS SHOE!! I have long been a serious adidas fan and when I saw this shoe I had to try it. I wanted this shoe as a runner and a trainer and it did not disappoint. I've always used adidas specialty shoes for fencing using their fencing specific shoes for fencing training and competition. As a fencer and runner I put a lot of abuse on my feet so I always look to adidas for footwear. This she is excellent not just for its low price tag but for any shoe of any price. The support is perfect for me and the responsiveness and bounce I find to work well for me. A great shoe loved it so much I bought two pairs, one in the hard to find core black/crystal white aramis dot pattern and one in the core black metallic silver. I don't wear this as a lifestyle shoe but as a functional runner and trainer and even use for fencing practice. For me this shoe is simply excellent.",71182457

GUA47,4,09/08/2016,Pretty Solid Shoe! Great sneakers! They run about a 1/2 size big but they are extremely comfortable. I like the style of the shoe and I can't wait for other color ways. My only issue with the shoe is that the material gets dirty really quick. I chose the grayish color and I have so many stains on them from running. All black is my next choice,71074401

I saw 2 Chainz rocking them at the NBA Finals and had to get my hands on a pair. finally found a color way that spoke to me with the grey combo. These are legit running shoes, but stable enough for training and lifting. Overall super versatile because I wear them casually and get a lot of compliments.",70458775

GUA47,5,08/21/2016,Can't believe they're only $100 These are some of my favorite shoes right now! They are super comfortable and I can wear them casually even if I'm walking long distances. I'm not really a runner; I got them more because I like how they look and I will definitely be buying another pair in another color. And the best part is they look beautiful in pictures but even better in person,70319001

Conforms nicely to your feet for great support.",69930628
GUA47,5,08/15/2016,One of the most underrated comfy shoes Great product especially for the price great quality mesh and a very comfortable shoe very underrated love the colorway too,69930334
GUA47,5,08/14/2016,"Redefined sneakers for me My experience with sneakers have always been the classic chunky cross trainers or running shoes. I decided to try something different and am so glad I did.

These shoes have helped me get back into exercising. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra bounce in your step but with hardly any weight. These were perfect for me to jog in, but also to wear to boxing where I found traditional sneakers too bulky.

These are now also my casual sneaker of choice because of how comfortable they are, plus I have gotten heaps of comments about how great they look (they look even better on person than in the pictures).

This is my first purchase with Adidas, and will definitely be my brand of choice from now on. I'll probably upgrade these when my running gets more serious (not sure about their support for long distances), but they are perfect for me now both for fitness and casual wear.

Fit true to size, I have quite wide feet and they fit me perfectly (US 13), for reference if I buy Nike I sometimes have to go the size up.",69902963

GUA47,4,08/10/2016,Perfect shoe for the price This was a very good product I just advise not to expect boost like comfort. Its comfortable I just hoped that with the NMDs and Ultraboost that the Alphabounce would use that new comfort tech. Neverthe less worth it and fits like a sock,69735943

GUA47,4,08/02/2016,"Perfect fit & comfort even for narrow feet Super comfortable sneakers, comparable to that of ultra boosts but for half the price!
Having narrow feet, I was worried about the neoprene-like upper being too wide or buckling when tightening the laces; but not a problem!  I can pull the laces as tight as possible but no bunching occurs and the shoes remain supportive, comfortable and no loss of performance.

The relatively flat profile of the sole lends itself to being more of a casual or training shoe.  I found the curved sole of the ultra boost uncaged particularly conducive to running and following my natural stride.   

Length fits true to size (despite other reviews suggesting they run a bit large) for me. 

Core black colourway is minimalist sleek ... but hopefully we get the ""Aramis"" black/white patterned drop here in Aus!!",69395457
GUA47,5,08/02/2016,"Way better than a Nike product.

GUA47,5,07/19/2016,"Great purchase I originally bought the shoes, because I liked the style. Turns out they ran a little big so I had to send them back and get a smaller size. It was well worth it they are extremely comfortable and stylish. I love the fact that Adidas has came on strong.",68846996

GUA47,5,07/10/2016,truly best purchase i have ever made I have bought many Adidas shoes over the years. These alpha bounce are by far the best.

Thank you Adidas for your commitment to quality and satisfaction that to me far exceeds any other brand!!!!,68544574
GUA47,4,07/10/2016,"Comfortable everyday shoe The fused upper mesh is actually more of a neoprene material and is one solid piece that does hug your foot like a sock. It's comfortable, but doesn't breathe much. I bought these for work use, not running. As an everyday shoe, they are excellent and comfortable. I'm on my feet 10+ hours a day and they are perfect for long shifts. By, I would imagine that I would sweat quite a bit if I used them as my main running shoes.",68544407

GUA47,5,07/09/2016,Best bang for your buck Great shoe at a great price. Very comfortable and stylish. They do run a little big I'd say about a half size. Try them on if you can. I wear a 14/15 and wish I got the 14 instead of the 15 but they still fit well with a little wiggle room. Not really sure how they perform because I have them for casual use at the moment. Would buy 5 more pairs without a doubt. More colors soon please adidas! Great job as always.,68523863

Many shoes that I have tried on in the past that have a seamless upper, are either very hard to get on or once you get them on, there is too much space in certain areas.

Don't let the word firmer fool you, these shoes are very comfortable and very cushiony, they're terrific.

GUA47,4,07/02/2016,"The price point is honestly the best part of these shoes. The Alpha Bounce is the first pair of adidas I have purchased in several years. After I stopped rocking shell toes I started collecting nike exclusively. I decided on the Alphas after seeing 2 chainz rocking a pair in Game 5 of the Finals. I purchased a 10.5 online and they are still sitting in the box they came in. I tried on a pair of 10s in store and realized the 10.5 is probably a half size too big. I chose the solar purple colorway and I love the look! I'm sure when  I finally wear them out they will receive great reactions. I loved the fit in store and the bounce was super comfortable. I don't have to tell anyone that the price on these is ridiculously affordable and I think I may grab another colorway before adidas decides to match nikes presto prices at 120! Grab a few pair of these while you can, they are great summer shoes and perfect for a early morning or late afternoon run!",68275844
GUA47,5,07/02/2016,A good purchase in my opinion. I like the shoes but the size was a little too big and I got my usual size and the shoe overall is a great shoe I love it.,68274493

GUA47,4,07/02/2016,Great debut for a new line of sneaker. They are very comfortable. The look gets compliments. Compared to my other Adidas these shoes are very long.

GUA47,4,07/01/2016,"Good bang for your buck shoe! Good entry level running shoe. Adidas had me at $100! its definitely stylish and wearable besides just being a running shoe. Initially the forefoot cushioning feels great but as you get passed that, while running the lack of flexibility becomes an issue (if you crave a flexible runner this is probably not for you). Lastly get your true size, I went a half size up thinking they'd fit like ultra boost and I was wrong. The lack of heel support (locked in heel) in large part due to that 1.5 centimeter difference made for sloppy heel play during my run. Im beginning to think wearing my true size would make a difference in the overall performace of the shoe. These are 6/10 for Perfromance (not a heavy usage runner in my opinion) and an 8 of 10 in terms of style. Many thanks adidas!",68240213
GUA47,5,07/01/2016,"A lot of tech in this shoe for such an affordable price. It's a really clean looking shoe and it is very comfortable.

Highly recommend this shoe. Don't sleep on them.",68236938
GUA47,2,06/23/2016,"would not recommend for any activty Below average. I received this shoe and was excited. But, my normal size 9 was too big. I needed an 8.5. The shoe is very unstable because of the material and very wide.

The heel cup is more shallow and they are tighter across the ball of the foot. I will stay with adidas but will look for a different model that fits better.,97726092

Firm enough to never bottom out.  I do short runs (a mile or so) and play volleyball in them, as well as just general playing around, chasing the kids about.  They work great for everything.

BEY10,3,09/27/2017,"Shallow heel I bought these because I thought they would be a cheaper alternative to the Ultraboost ST. They just don’t compare. The heel is too shallow and you have to lock them down. Even then, they just don’t mold to my foot like adidas usually do. 

They aren’t bad shoes if they suit you, but they are not in the same class as the ultraboost ST. Spend the extra, especially since the adidas website gives you 15% off.",93652656

BEY10,4,07/20/2017,"Surpasses the old Supernova Sequence Stability shoe For those used to running in Adidas Supernova Sequence stability shoes, the ST offers greater absorption of impact and much better cushioning with the use of the Boost technology.

The toe box feels slightly wider but the internally the shoe is a more comfortable fit as a whole compared with previous Supernova Sequence.

A slightly lighter shoe and sleek design with the boost technology is a great step in the right direction for Adidas and the stability line. 

I did buy the black colour online and would say these actually appear more on the dark grey side than the black it shows on the website.",90667352

Slight issue with the design around the ankle - feels a bit lacking in support compared to other adidas trainers (i.e. sequence boosts and boost STs) which led to slight slippage around ankle area over longer runs. Overall, very comfortable for walking around and gym use but have not my preferred choice for running outdoors over any 10km+ distance.",89780480

BEY99,4,12/07/2017,"Great daily trainer for feeling light and fast The shoes are what I expected them to be: light-weight, cushion, quality and comfortable; it took me 40-50 miles in a course of one week to break them in. I use them between Supernova Glide 8 and Boston 6—they're exactly fit that middle spot. They're on the light side as Boston 6. Not as fast and comfortable (glove-like footwrapping) as Boston 6. But Tempo 9s have good support cushion for longer training runs. If you had to buy just one pair of shoes to do everything, Tempo 9 would be good choice. One thing, I wear 12.5 (Supernova and Boston 6), but my local store had them in stock and after trying them I went with size 13 for Tempo 9s (I've midium width feet).",97901133

BEY99,2,11/18/2017,"Not the same I started running on a pair of tempo 8 (v1 green) and I loved literally everything about them (about 600 miles at this point). This new version went on sale and I jumped on it, to extreme disappointment. Out of the box the laces come going out to in, unlike literally every other shoe requiring you to take them out and re-lace them. The tongue is no longer gusseted, therefor slides and bunches. The quality feels HEAVILY reduced, feeling cheap on your foot. The toe box is much smaller, they reduced the stable frame from under the ball of your foot to just under your toes and replaced it with a energized stability boost, which I feel like once broken in won't give nearly as much pronation support as the stable frame. To try and compensate the pushing forward of the stable frame they tried to compensate by adding more torsional control on the inner heel alike the supernova, but it just makes the shoes ridiculously rigid out of the box. I'm disappointed because the tempo 8's are the most comfortable feeling shoes to run in both long and short distances, and this seems like a serious step down :/",97284872

BEY99,4,11/18/2017,"light makes fast I've had at least 3 tempos before (the 5 and two pairs of the 6), all of which were before the Boost technology. I still love the shoe, but the sizing is so frustrating - I was 9.5 in the other pairs, but the sizing for this model seems to have changed. It's silly that there is so little consistency. BUT, if you can get the size right I'm confident this would be an even better shoe than its predecessors. ""Light makes fast"" as the insoles used to say. I use mine for pretty much all running, not just threshold/tempo runs. If you're not too heavy (I'm 10 stone 2 pounds) and need no or only mild stability features, why wouldn't you?",97271739

BEY99,4,09/27/2017,"Great but way too narrow midfoot These are just a little bit shorter than Adizero Adios 2 (the old non-Boost ones). I've always used the same size for Adidas but I think I need to go 1/2 size up with all the current Adizero models.

These have the same issue as I had with Supernova: The midfoot part is way too narrow. (I have regular width forefoot.) The high edge of the midsole hits my arch. I think at least the Supernova line has gone narrower from midfoot after Glide 7...

I returned these. However, the shoes appeared to be very good so if your midfoot is narrow these can work for you. The heel is almost completely neutral. The front has the most of the stability features. The cushioning felt excellent: not too soft but not hard at all, just right.",93642619

BEY99,5,08/06/2017,Wonderful fitting shoe! The shoe fits very nicely on the feet and wraps around so smooth and light..perfect for tempo runs,91612923
BEY99,4,07/23/2017,"Good shoe for fast paced daily training It's a great shoe for fast paced dailey training. I kept the same size as my other adidas shoes. The fit of this shoe is different from the other shoes. It has a snug forefoot, but not uncomfortable. It has also a pointy toe-box. Which means that the Tempo 9 has an overall snug fit including a relatively shallow toe-box.  A faster shoe is tighter like a race-shoe. As for the fit, the Tempo 9 has a bit of a racing shoe. For me, no problem.  However, people with a wider forefoot should keep this in mind and better choose a size larger. The Tempo 9 has a firm ride. Soft the shoe may not be, but responsive it certainly is. The Tempo 9 is a lightweight and supportive trainer. The tempo 9 is a neutral runningshoe. But I have a slight overpronation. However, the shoe supports sufficient and has no problems in this area. The upper is airy en there's enough ventilation. I can't say much about the durability of the shoe. But my experience with my other adidas says this is good. The Continental outsoles are very durable. So I'm verry happy with these shoes.",90942402
BEY99,5,07/20/2017,Wondedrful. This is my third comment on these shoes. They are absolutely wonderful. I am going to order another pair.,90669629
BEY99,5,07/17/2017,"A great companion to the Adios 3 I've been wearing the previous version of the Tempo, the Tempo 8, as my daily trainer for everything from steady long runs to fast interval sessions. The Tempo 8 were very good shoes, but the Tempo 9 are better. I race in the Adios 3, and the Tempo 9 are a beefed up version of the Adios 3 in many respects. The upper of the Tempo 9 is the biggest improvement over the Tempo 8. Gone is the sleeve, in favour of a more traditional tongue with a lace loop. The tongue is more comfortable than the previous versions sleeve. I always found the sleeve a slight bit too short on the Tempo 8, but the tongue on the Tempo 9 solves that. The sole unit is changed, and now uses dual density Boost in the midfoot on the inside. In reality this feels quite similar to the previous version, offering just a touch of stability. The torsion system in the new version is very similar to the Adios 3, and extends to the inner heel, which it didn't do on the Tempo 8. If anything this makes the Tempo 9 feel more responsive, but not noticeably more so than the 8. The Continental rubber outsole, a brilliant compound offering great grip on tar, grass or even compact trail, has been beefed up a little and should last longer. If you liked the Tempo 8, you'll get on great with the Tempo 9. If you race in the Adios 3, you could easily use the Tempo 9 as your daily trainer. The fit of the upper feels a little more ""racing flat"" than the Tempo 8. Fits my foot perfectly, but those with wider feet will need to try them on before buying. Overall the build quality is a step up on the newer version, but the feel is very similar to the 8 if a little snappier. Drop remains at 10mm so nothing to worry about there.",90531596
BEY99,3,07/16/2017," My first disappointing sneakers from Adidas. First of all, these shoes are much more green in person than the pictures show. So if you were hoping for a turquoise blue, like in the pics, you will not be getting those. There were also several QC issues. Loose stitching in a couple spots. Large chunks of what appeared to be excess thread stuck between seams, affecting the aesthetic. As for the Boost soles, they do appear substantial, but while moderately comfortable to walk in, the cushioning was nowhere near my Iniki Runners. I was pleasantly surprised by how breathable the shoes were. Very airy. But misleading color, QC issues, and insufficient Boost, make this an average shoe at best. Glad I didn't pay full price!",90509173

BEK63,2,07/15/2017, Shoe doesn't seem to breath as well as other Adidas shoe I've purchased before. Fit and comfort were good but found them to get uncomfortable when I wore them for long walks as seem to breath as well even though it is mesh material. Would return except living overseas make it impracticable.,90471175
BEK63,5,07/11/2017,Great shoe I really liked running in the Supernova ST. I've only run about 5ks in them so far and I hope to do so much more. It was my first time with Boost and I will definitely try it again. A good looking and good feeling shoe.,90006802
BEK63,5,07/08/2017,Nice shoe. Well worth a look Comfortable shoe. Bought for running but funky styling,89909852
BEK63,3,07/07/2017,"Not the model for me too soft, weird bend in the toe box that affects top of feet, heel did not feel deep cause shoes to feel as if they would slide off if not overtightened",89891799
BEK63,5,07/04/2017,"Great shoe, good support and has the feel of great quality I was apprehensive to try these shoes as they looked heavy and chunky. As there was no other alternative and the Glide model appeared to be discontinued I decided to give these a try. I am happy with them so far and curious to see how long they last.",89716401
BEK63,5,07/04/2017,Beautifully comfortable shoes Perfect support. Perfect colour. A pleasure to run in.,89714561
BEK63,1,07/02/2017,Don't buy!!! I was told this would be like the new version of the supernova sequence it's not!! Don't buy these shoes if you're looking for something like the supernova sequence . It doesn't have enough dept to put your foot in a have it stable like the sequence . I have no arch so I need all the support I can get . I wish I could switch them for an old version of the sequence that's how bad they are.,89587042
BEK63,5,06/27/2017,"Very comfy Like the shoes a lot. Good support for over pronator. I like the fit, fits to the foot like wearing a glove much better than other brands I tried",89246169
BEK63,4,06/27/2017,"Ideal high volume training shoe, ideal for those with recurring achilles issues. I have found this to be a very comfortable, stable, well structured, high volume running shoe, with excellent traction. As I have had recurring issues with my achilles in the past I very much appreciate the soft achilles heel that this shoe has, with support in the heel coming from supports at either side of the achilles (I wish more running shoes had this feature).",89219185
BEK63,5,06/24/2017,"Great shoe Comfy stable shoe, great for long runs with great cushioning but it's not sloppy. The shoe is heavy but runs light and quick so you don't notice the weight. It can also be used for quicker runs. So far this is turning out to be a great shoe, not too sure about the colours that I got, but I judge a shoe on how it runs",89103878

BEK63,2,06/15/2017,"Not a very stable shoe. I was under the impression the ""Supernova"" line was a control/stability shoe. I must be mistaken b/c I felt like a baby giraffe on ice skates in these shoes. They just weren't for me. Maybe it's just the ""Supernova Sequence"" that is the control shoe?",88710346
BEK63,5,06/15/2017,"Great purchase, worth every dollar Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, I bought mine, my dad tried them on and asked me to buy some for him, he is in love with them and always wants to go running!",88709197
BEK63,2,06/15/2017,New version is a big downgrade from prior versions I greatly preferred the Supernova Stability version of the shoe. The new shoe feels very squishy. I will not buy another pair of these.,88691499
BEK63,3,06/15/2017,"I really like the show, terrible feet issues. Usually Brook's work for me. These feel right but I wish Adidas offered this shoe in wide. S Adidas should offer this shoe in wide. many flat feet people out there and this shoe is high quality",88691169

BEK63,1,05/29/2017,"Not even close to replacing the Supernove Glide. This was supposed to be the replacement for the Supernova Glide, but is nothing like it. Higher sole made running uncomfortable, and wider sole base at the arch made it feel like running in platforms.",87189897

BEK63,5,05/16/2017,They suit me A great road running shoe. I am normally an 11 but bought 1/2 size larger to get the right fit.,86527559
BEK63,5,05/10/2017,Extremely comfortable shoe Returning because the exterior heel has a chamfer which pronates your foot out. As someone who already has a slight outside pronation; it magnifies it. Love the feel and fit of the shoe; extremely comfortable except for the heel.,86324704
BEK63,3,05/09/2017,Shoe quality and comfort is great but the colors were a tad off from the computer (which is reasonable). Odd color combination but good quality shoe. The maroon with orange struck me as odd.,86255174

BEK63,4,04/21/2017,Good solid pair of all round gym shoes. Great pair if sexy looking shoes that are equally at home on the treadmill or doing crossfit type training in the gym.,84621525
BEK63,1,04/18/2017,"I wouldn't recommend buying this shoe to anyone. The shoe opening is too wide, you'll need to tie your shoes extremely tight in order to keep us from slipping off from the heel. The problem with that is if they're too tight my feet go numb while running. There's also this weird feeling I get like if I'm running on a shoe lace, or my sock folded up inside the shoe but when I check it's nothing. Only happens with this shoe.",84474064
BEK63,4,04/01/2017,"Light, comfy and supportive Had supernova's 10 years ago. Fixed the rear heel picking, and added boost means a nice comfortable ride for me!",83711945
BEK63,4,03/21/2017,different - and one person has already said where did you get them from the colours - something different can wear them with jeans and tracksuit bottoms and shorts,83091183
BEK63,3,03/17/2017,"Really not for me Unfortunately these shoes came across like there's just been too much plastic used in the construction of the uppers, that's not to say they were poorly assembled just really not what I was looking for in a running shoe... I've ordered a pair of Ultra Boost ST in hope they are a more minimal build up top... When trying the shoes on I was really pleasantly surprised at the Boost sole, hopefully I can get on with the Ultra Boost...",82941361

BEY13,4,12/12/2017,"Really, really comfortable They are a bit small on the length, but they are supposed to be quite fitted to your feet - so maybe it’s just case of getting use to it!

BEY13,5,11/01/2017,"The best shoes! This is my 2nd pair (I also own a pair of original Ultraboost). Both are very comfy, this one fits slightly more snugly and feels better without socks. Colour is beautiful. Sizing, as with Ultraboost, runs very small and narrow (I run 1.5 size up for this pair and 1 full size up for the normal one).",95962870

BEY13,5,10/12/2017,"best running shoes These are just beautiful shoes and so comfortable, it is like running in bouncy socks! I have a large bunion and makes running difficult if the shoes are not perfect as always end up with blisters underneath it. These shoes are soft and nothing to cause blisters, so comfortable and light. The size seems ever so slightly on the small size, I wear size 5 shoes but buy size 6 running shoes, however these don't seem to leave the extra space at the toes. I have not run more than 5 km in them so far so don't know how will they hold up for longer distance but you might have to go 1.5-2 sizes up if you like more space for toes. They are really so beautiful that if I were not obsessed about keeping my running shoes for running only, I would wear them all the time!",94291389
BEY13,3,10/11/2017,A bit tight I love these trainers however I usually wear a size 3 and purchased a size 3.5 trainer however these are too tight and think that a size 4 would be more suitable.,94262553

BEY13,5,08/22/2017,"super cool running shoes The shoes look amazing, super cool for running shoes. I ordered a size up and they fit perfectly. Very comfortable and soft overall, but should have worn with socks, as the fabric rubbed against my ankles. Less stability in the heel as I'm used to from other running shoes, but again better with socks. The sole is very soft and I could feel an uneven ground, little stones etc. Overall a very good running shoe in my opinion.",92511549

I haven problems with rubbing or pinching. It's just getting them on is the problem. I'm hoping that in time that will become easier. Love the color and the price is worth it.",90917204

BEY13,4,07/05/2017,"Gorgeous shoe, just too narrow for me I ordered a half size bigger than my usual 10. The shoes were perfect and beautiful with the shimmering silver except the width bothered me. I have feet that are a little on the wider side. I am easily distracted and bothered by shoes hugging the top of my feet, so I decided to return them. I found another style boost with the silver details that fit better.",89790624
BEY13,5,07/02/2017,Most comfortable shoe ever. Love it. I have been recommending thwse to everyone.,89644677
BEY13,3,06/30/2017,"So hopeful, but disappointed I was so excited to order the Parley version of this shoe and have had decent luck with Adidas running shoes in the past. They do have a great look and you would never know the materials were recycled. I did end up returning these because the webbing which is used for the lacing system is connected and secured right under the forefoot - so just below my toes in this shoe. Because this is a stripped down shoe, I could distinctly feel the webbing under my feet and found it really uncomfortable. Not sure if I got a bad pair as no others have commented on this problem, but I sent them back because of it. So sad.",89545917
BEY13,4,06/24/2017,"The perfect shoe This is my first ultra boost shoe. I think it's absolutely amazing. I notice a huge difference in my workout just because of the shoe.

BEY13,3,06/23/2017," Wanted to love these, but they are one of the more uncomfortable running shoes I've worn in recent memory. They just did not fit my feet well. I tried to run in them for about a month, thinking they would get better with a few miles, but nothing changed. Will be switching back to the regular boosts.",89079779
BEY13,3,06/19/2017,"Good but not Great. Aesthetically, they are great. Mine squeak when I walk in them all the sudden, which is annoying. Also you need to wear a high sock because the back will rub your ankle. Since they have that sock like sneaker feel, they run a little on the smaller side.",88881897
BEY13,5,06/19/2017,"Love, love, love these shoes! These were my first Ultraboost purchase, and I'm a fan! Super comfortable and lightweight, without compromising support!

After wearing them a few times, I barely it noticed anymore!",88881604
BEY13,3,06/16/2017,"Wouldn't Recommend for Long Distance Running Super cool shoe looks wise and fairly comfortable to wear throughout the day or at the gym. When I finally started wearing these outside to actually run in (I purchased the pearl white pair so didn't want to wear them outside) I ended up with terrible blisters on my heel from the thick plastic on the back of the shoe. I was in pain while running and when I got home was surprised with blood all over my beautiful white shoes :(. It's a week later and my blisters still hurt. So while they LOOK awesome, I wouldn't necessarily think they are worth the price if you are looking for a great running shoe.",88814223
BEY13,2,06/16/2017,Not a fan I was highly disappointed I'm a huge fan of the boost technology however this one was not made well. Should have ordered the energy boost again for my running shoe.,88726845
BEY13,4,06/15/2017,Love these bad boys. I love these shoes. the only reason I have it a four star instead of five was if I'm running in them for more than 3 hrs or walking in them most of the day the back rubs on my Achilles Tendon. So I have to wear high ankle socks. Other than that I really love these shoes.,88714462

I didn't get blisters, but it really hurts so bad I can't wear them. And I don't want to wear socks, which would kind of ruin the whole concept of the shoe. Very sad I bought these, and can't send them back because I wore them already.",86862918
BEY13,2,05/22/2017,Returned I got another shoe first in size 8 and it was huge so then I ordered these instead size 7.5 and they were way to small. I don't understand why your shoe sizes are so off by shoe.,86846521

BEY13,3,05/02/2017,"Neat idea. Poor sizing. Comfortable Fit. Heavy for running. This seems like an awesome (running) shoe. However, it runs AT LEAST a half size TOO BIG. I am a standard size 7.5, and I could've honestly used either the 7, or maybe even the 6.5 with how large this shoe runs. I bought this shoe with the intention of running - and with purpose of going to the gym and walking around / running errands. Would have loved to use it, as it is SUPER comfy - but I'm not sure it's worth the purchase price (plus, it's a little heavy for a running shoe)... so I sadly did not exchange for correct size. Cannot comment on durability or longevity of this product, as I have not ran in them. The concept seems cool, but the price tag is not (especially since the sizing is so far off).",86015228
BEY13,4,05/02/2017,"Cute but snug Usually wear between a size 6 but knew these would run a bit narrow so I went ahead and order a size 6.5 fits pretty good length wise and snug on the sides, I would recommend if you have a wide foot to order a half size but.

BEY13,5,02/28/2017,"Best looking ultra boost so far One of the most comfortable, supportive, cushioned and stylish running sneakers i have ever owned. The shape and fit are streamlined and hug every curve of my foot, supporting every step atop the ingenious ultra boost sole.
Being a staunchly proud devotee of the ultra boost line, the ultraboost x ltd is by far the best fit for me.  Loving the silver ultra boost sole and metallic highlights, these are way too good looking for an everyday sneaker!",82289982

BEY13,5,02/18/2017,"Favorite running shoe Amazing quality and super comfortable! I'd say size up 1/2 size if you are going to be running distance in these. I'm am 8.5 in normal ultraboosts and got these in 8.5, they are fine for me and I don't really mind as they are so absolutely beautiful! They make my foot look way slimmer than the ultraboosts and I love the fit of the arch! Will be definitely buying another color as they are great for running and look amazing with any outfit.",81751557

CEN74,2,12/24/2017,Narrow and not comfortable Pure boosts/energy boosts way are way better than the supernovas. They are way too narrow and the quality is not near as good as other boots.,98404960
CEN74,3,12/17/2017,Close but not quite right I have run in the 2 previous versions of this shoe (Supernova Glide) and they were simply the best trainers I’ve ever own.  This version just doesn’t quite live up to those standards.  The Boost technology still feels great to run in. A nice combo of cushion and support.  This shoe falls short in other ways.  My heel feels like it could slip out of the shoe at any moment.  After 4 or 5 runs I thought this issue would go away.  It has not.  The other issue is the tongue feels uncomfortable on the top of my foot.  This is more of an issue when walking than running.  So overall I still love the Boost technology but this version of the Supernova fell short of expectations.,98223728
CEN74,5,12/15/2017,"Almost as good as my old Boosts, so pretty awesome I love them as a replacement for my old Boosts. Very comfortable and lightweight",98147925

CEN74,5,12/09/2017,Very comfortable shoes and they look great too! Purchased for my husband who was sceptical at first about buying shoes online. When they arrived he tried them on. The fit was perfect and he was impressed with how comfortable they felt. Very happy with them.,97966912
CEN74,4,12/09/2017, Great fit. Very good cushioning. Required a bit of breaking in. Nice shoe!,97966221
CEN74,2,12/09/2017,"Good cushion, but not comfortable I have used Adidas (non Boost) in the past, and have been happy with them, so I decided to give the Boost cushioning a shot. Although the feel of the cushioning is nice, the tongue is an issue as reported by other users. It does not stay in place and the top of it seems too thick. This results in the tongue constantly sliding to the outside, and creating pressure on the top of the foot. Like others, I tried relacing, but I found myself constantly adjusting the tongue with minimal relief even after a 1.5 week of ""break-in"" period"". Will return them and wait for another version with a better tongue design (like the GB8). 2 stars for the cushioning but the tongue and the discomfort associated with it drops the rating",97956047

CEN74,5,12/05/2017,Perfect running shoe for me. Slips a little on the heal but the perfect running shoe for me. I would recommend buying these shoes for track/ cross country training.

CEN74,5,11/20/2017,"Best Version Yey I have been running in Supernovas for over 6 years now - long before BOOST was a thing. My earlier first few pairs of supernova glides would give me approx 800km running (80% road) which I was very happy with. Every since BOOST came into the scene, I've been averaging 2200-2500km with each pair (+2500km of walking) - and they still have support. 
This newest model is an extremely high performance shoe which is highly stable, fits like a glove, feels extremely comfortable and is FAST! Ever since BOOST came around, I haven't had any stress fractures training for Ironman races, and this shoe is no different (I have ~200km banked in this current model and they feel great.) This is the right shoe for me & I wont change shoe models unless they stop making them. I recommend buying two pairs at a time!",97334592

CEN74,3,09/16/2017,"Needs more durable outsole tread material I bought 2 pair of these shoes at the outlet mall in Allen, TX. I've been looking for a replacement running shoe for one named after a mythological winged horse. This shoe is definitely in the same class and category. Initially I was very pleased with the comfort and softness of the shoe and the Boost foam. The shoe felt a little heavy and clunky compared to what I was used to running in, but then again, I'm on a shoe hunt. It's now 7.5 months later and each shoe has about 160 miles on them. The uppers still look great and no separation of materials. But the tread material on the outsoles is thinning badly. I'm a bit of a heel striker, and the soles have worn down to nothing on the outer edges and ready to start wearing into the white Boost foam midsole. I don't know if I'll even get 200 miles out of these. 160 miles seems a bit low to expect to get out of a pair of running shoes. I guess my search will continue looking at other models of other brands in this same (neutral) shoe class. Sorry, Adidas.",93310112

CEN74,5,07/24/2017,"Best running shoes for supination So, I have flat feet and these shoes are the perfect match for my needs. When I run the outside of my foot lands first, and this leads to getting really fast shin splints for me. I did some research and I concluded that these were prob the best shoes out there for my kind of foot. I'm not the type to write reviews, but man not even a week in and my shin splints are already to a minimum. There's only one downside about the shoe, but I believe that it's outweighed by all the pros: breaking in the shoes was the worst on my shins I could barely walk after the first time I ran in them. But if you need a shoe that helps with supination then I believe that's a small obstacle that's easily overcome within a week. Also, I know that you should always buy bigger running shoes than normal shoes, but in my experience these adidas shoes scale a bit bigger than normal running shoes.

This makes it feel like an object is stuck between my sock and the shoe. I have readjusted the laces but it is still uncomfortable.

I will be returning these shoes ASAP.",89276104

CEN74,5,06/27/2017,"Great, snug fit - very happy with ride too. I had read that these fit slightly small, so I ordered 1 whole size bigger and the fit was great. I have a wide fitting, but the toe box was fine in the larger size.

CEN74,1,06/15/2017," adidas has been churning out a series of bulky, extremely heavy running shoes lately. Also, I notices adidas has been focusing on style (looks) rather than functionality. At any rate, these shoes are well designed. They're pretty. But when you wear them you feel like you're wearing lead boots. This is a shoe that comes at 10 oz for size 9. That's heavy! I wear size 11.5, so you do the math. There are other options on the market of shoes that are much lighter and are also durable. I am sorry to have to say this but adidas made a mistake in producing these shoes.",88692843

Now, it's over, you can put the Glide beside the Energy.

I haven't had a chance to run in these shoes yet, but from experience with Boost shoes they will be comfortable from the first KM all the way through many many hundreds of KMs. When I first put the shoe on, and wore it around walking for a bit, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the material on the inside of the shoe. The shoe really hugs around your heel and achilles tendon very nicely. The upper material is very soft and stretchy further increasing comfort without sacrificing stability. There is more of a Boost midsole compared to previous models of this shoe and you can feel right away the added ""cloudy"" feeling within every step. I'm very excited to hit the road with these!",84351597

CEN74,4,03/19/2017,A good marathon training shoe. The Glide 9 appears to be a complete sole re-design from the SuperNova Glide 8.  You should consider the Glide 8 to be the last of its line and the 9 to be a completely different model.  I have trained for and ran 6 marathons in the SuperNova Glide 2 through 7.  After only a couple of winter runs it is too early to tell how this shoe will compare.,83025165

CEN74,2,02/18/2017,"Disappointing successor to the Glide 8 I have to agree with the other reviewers which have pointed out how the Glide 8 was so much better. This has nothing of the responsiveness of the previous model, it's just too mushy and soft, and the tongue is too long and won't stay in place.

Why change what was pretty much a perfect shoe for the worse?",81736765
CEN74,4,02/18/2017,"narrow! quit making shoes so narrow! the sole is wider than my other adidas running shoes but ends there. tongue doesn't stay in place. I love adidas shoes but  they won't address people with wide feet. I'm 5'10"" and 195lbs.",81729131
CEN74,3,02/16/2017,"Decent shoe. This is not the Glide Boost I know. The end of an era. Adidas finally changed this shoe...a lot. And in this case it's not an improvement. There's nothing inherently wrong with the new Supernova, but it holds almost nothing in common with the previous versions. The Glide Boost has been my favorite distance running shoe since it was introduced a few years back. The previous versions 2013-2016 were the absolute perfect blend of well cushioned trainer and excellent feel. This current version of the Supernova has lost all of snapiness. What's left feels like a maximal plush ride for moderate to slow pace. The sizing is also strange. I feel like the shoe has gotten shorter and more narrow than the previous versions. I had to go up half a size which only added to the already bulky feel. The bottom line is that the Supernova might be a solid shoe for someone with no history with this model, but in my opinion it is inferior in all the ways that matter to the previous versions. I suppose I better start stocking up on old inventory. I can't stress how disappointing it is to lose the niche this model filled.",81662202
CEN74,3,02/14/2017,"Good shoe, but step back from the Glide 8 These are a step back from the Glide 7 & 8. The upper is more constrictive with more pressure points, and the cushioning is now too soft and nowhere near as responsive as the last models. Overall a decent shoe, but I wish Adidas would have left a good thing alone.",81609359
CEN74,4,02/14/2017,"Well cushioned and extremely comfortable ride. The product is quite simply one of the best boost based products out there. From previously using the cushioned response 22 shoe, this is probably the next best thing. However, there is the need to order a half a shoe size up as the Adidas fit is smaller than most other manufactures out there.",81600908
CEN74,2,02/12/2017,"100km down and time for a replacement If you are buying this due to how good the Glide 8 was, I'd go elsewhere. There are a number of changes over the Glide 8, the tongue and sole are quite different and sadly not in a good way. 

The new eyelet design results in either a failure to be able to get it comfortably tied or a tongue that will slip during running. 

The sole is now so soft it feels as if it has lost the responsiveness of the previous version. It is ok for a lazy Sunday run, but at pace it feels like a drag that adds to the work. This softness will also increase calf strain, which may lead to calf pain. 

On the plus side the new sole is very grippy and durable. 

At this stage this shoe is being retired to my lazy short runs and I'm picking another shoe for those beyond 5km or those where I want a faster pace.",81505470

My foot just does not feel locked in while wearing this new design. It seems to slide around like it needs more support. I have to over tighten the laces to make up for that, which makes the shoe less comfortable. That's a real bummer because I absolutely loved the glide 7.",80913429

I have worn Adidas shoes for many years now, I have to keep reasonably fit by walking about 6 to 8 Kms about 4 to 5 times a week mostly up hills, I cant run due to a problem in my lower back which I injured when I was working and when I retired I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, thats why I have to keep reasonably fit.

They seem a little tighter around the middle and top of the shoe, and the ride is a little more clumpy. 200 miles in and I've have worn them in somewhat now so they don't feel as constricting, and they're still a good reliable shoe for putting in lots of mileage during training. But maybe be aware of the fit if you haven't got the narrowest feet.",78861675
CEN74,1,01/11/2017,"unbearable I finally worn out my second pair of supernova 7's and fancied an upgrade to the new supernova 9. Felt fine when I tried them on, but after a few miles running in them, I was feeling a discomfort under both my feet arches. Whilst there is huge amounts of cushioning, this was far too soft and resulted in my foot hitting the harder mid cushioning layer. felt like stepping on a stone every time I ran. I cannot run in these shoes, they are too painful. the old supernovas were great - i would recommend them to any neutral runner. the newest design is oh so terrible. £100 wasted.",78355856
CEN74,1,01/06/2017,"Terrible update, nothing like previous version. This is a terrible update of my favorite trainer. It is basically a completely different shoe from the Glide 8. The new version feels clunky. They added about a half inch of stack height to the shoe for some reason. The tongue is ridiculously long and does not stay in place. It slides way over to the inside of the shoe. I went through 9 pairs of the Glide over the past three years and loved them. Now Adidas doesn't have a normal daily trainer in their lineup, so unfortunately I will have to look at other brands.",78094521

CEN74,1,12/10/2016,"Huge Step Down from the Supernova Glide 8 Wow I really did not like this shoe. Going back a shoe generation, the Supernova Glide 8 is my all-time favorite running shoe. In my opinion, it has an ideal balance of cushion and weight and makes running an absolute pleasure over almost any surface. That’s why I was so excited to try these new shoes, the Adidas Supernova (ordered directly from Adidas). The promise of 20% more cushion with only a .1 ounce weight gain coupled with slightly better heel lockdown was extremely intriguing and I couldn’t wait to try them out. Unfortunately, instead of having an even better experience than the one I had with the Glide 8, I had the WORST experience I’ve ever had with running shoes, and I’ve worn quite a few! First, the mid-section of the shoe is so tight that I felt like the blood flow had cut off in my feet. Let me just say, I’m 5’8, weigh 150, and I most certainly do NOT have wide feet. If anything, they’re on the narrow side. As a size 11, the length of the shoe was fine, but the mid-section was absolutely constricting. Second, on the left shoe, the top left Adidas stripe on the shoe was connected to a border material that was literally pushing into my foot when I ran. It felt like someone was jamming their finger into my foot. My immediate reaction was to redo/loosen the laces on the shoe and to adjust the shoe generally, but to no avail. It was such an unpleasant experience that I had to stop a half mile into my run because the shoes were hurting my feet so much. Even more than I am disappointed, I’m baffled that a shoe company like Adidas could create something so great with the Glide 8 and could turn around and design something as poor as this. Adidas, did you not test these extensively before release? Could this be a quality/control issue in manufacturing? Suffice it to say I will be sending these back. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that I did not toss my Supernova Glide 8’s (phew!) and will be very happily returning to them tomorrow morning.",76633987

CEN75,5,12/21/2017,Great shoe The slightly wider toe box is welcome as I have wider feet. Sadly the sole wears out MUCH faster than its predecessor with the change in sole design..

CEN75,5,11/21/2017,"A Bunion'd Runner's Best Friend I've got hallux rigidus, and it's very tough to find shoes that will accommodate a wide forefoot and a dorsal bunion. This shoe does, and very comfortably. With no flex in my right big toe, I overpronate wildly; this shoe gives me a bit of stability without forcing me into an unnatural gate. I've had no foot or ankle issues since I started wearing them in May, and I'm retiring them for a new pair after a November marathon. One caution: these run BIG. Instead of going up a half-size, as I've long done for running shoes, I wear the same size in this Supernova model as I do in street shoes.",97360917

It is very unpleasant that the model, designed for running, turned out to be so unreliable and not durable.

CEN75,4,06/20/2017,Bright and comfy. Really like the shoes - color looks exactly as it does online. They seem very comfortable (although a bit hard to pull on...might just take time to loosen up)but had to return because they were at least a half size too big if not more and it was hard not to notice. Plus for the price I decided I really didn't NEED these. Next time I'm on the market I'll probs come back to them.,88921717

I was really looking forward to these shoes but I made the mistake of ordering online instead of going to a store. Looks like neutral gait doesn't mean the same across brands.
I'm really sad because I just wasted money in shoes I can't run with and can't return them because I tried them already.
Adidas, you should allow to return shoes that are a ill fit.

When i first tried them on, they where a bit snug, but once worn in, they fitted like a glove.

CEN75,4,03/09/2017,Love the shoe Always wear adidas from 5k to marathon. Switched from the ultra boost as wanted some extra support for my foot rather than just the cage. These are great.

BEK69,5,12/19/2017,"Walking on clouds! Wow, I cannot say enough good things about this shoe!!! As soon as I received them in the mail I quickly tried them on and went for a run.

I had the very first boost sneakers (black color with that tiny yellow accent) which were for neutral gait and wore them while living in Manhattan for lots of walking. They were great, however, as I overpronate a bit, I need a stability shoe. I was very disappointed with the color offerings for women in a boost stability shoe and haven’t bought them for years until I came across these in the grey color and love them! Great for a walking shoe and jogging. Adidas please continue to offer a neutral color shoe. Many of us are not into flashy mix and match colors or sterotypical gender specific colors.",97732299
BEK69,4,12/02/2017, Great looking supportive shoe. I ordered down a size after reading reviews but shouldn't have because it was too small. My normal size would have been fine. If the return form had the option to order a larger pair I would have done so.,97718753

BEK69,4,11/20/2017,"Exactly what I expected (hoped) from an Adidas shoe! Firstly, I wasn’t looking for nor was I in need of new running shoes...but, I just couldn’t resist a good sale. Especially Adidas. I was a long-time committed Adidas wearer when I decided to switch things up...New Balance, Brooks, etc. Those were great shoes and hit all the right notes...but none could match the support & structured fit of an Adidas. So, since these were on sale, I decided to give them a try. If you like a firm, stiff shoe with lots of support, this is for you! Good , not great, cushioning...four out of five, maybe. The downside to all that structural support is weight...may be my imagination but these feel heavy, or heavier than I’d grown used to. My other quibble is the fit at the top, front part of the ankle...at the laces. There’s a really stiff bit of material on either side of the last lace hole. At first it went unnoticed...Once home, I re-laced & omitted the final 2 (?) holes. So far, so good...no blisters, hot spots or irritations. I’m happy with these...for now, I’m alternating between the Adidas and another brand. Not yet sure which I prefer, yet...but I do like that support!",97327981

BEK69,5,11/13/2017,"Very comfortable Nice looking shoes, very comfortable- based on reviews I ordered a half size smaller and they are perfect- I do wish they had a bit more structure on the top sides as the mesh isnt very supportive, but the soles are great. No regrets!",97012352
BEK69,5,11/11/2017,I don’t know why I even bother with other shoes This is the best brand for my feet. I first wore supernova 10 years ago. I walked 26 mi for the Avon walk for Breast cancer. Did not get one blister. I love theses shoes.,96984025

BEK69,5,09/24/2017,"Color different than expected I was really excited for this shoe, but I'm a straight 8.5 and they were a half size too large on me, so I'm returning them. Not a big deal, but I wish the size chart had an in/cm comparison so I could've been sure of which size to get. The reason I'm not just exchanging for a half size smaller is because they are not black (with purple/coral) like I thought, but a deep dusty blue. Still cute, and maybe it's the fault of my computer color settings, but I was specifically looking for black. The color name Legend Ink threw me off as well, hindsight shows me that means blue, not black.",93505163

Yummy mummy suitable but not so NOW it's over in 6 months (like some trainers), I fell for these runners. However, they are a wide fit at the front and I have changed mine for one size smaller because I have super slim feet. Other than the size issue, I adore these ankle saving, foot saving, stable and pretty shoes for a unstable and sometimes ugly world.",91129825
BEK69,4,07/26/2017, Very nice shoe and good for runners needing extra stability. Feels quite heavy but fine once you've gotten used to it. Only problem is let's rain water in quite easily.,91119213

This is my fifth pair of Supernovas. I switched to a different style of Adidas once and didn't make it through my running season with them. These provide the right support and amazing comfort. I highly recommend them, but I also highly recommend trying all types on at a store before making the commitment.",90549594

KEI26,4,12/12/2017,"Exceeded expectations. These are considerably more comfortable than any other spikes I have ever know. 
They are ridiculously light, and feel natural when sprinting.
I could list all the good stuff, but I won't.
My two main issues are the price being so high, and the fact that the red paint on the spike plate comes off very easily, I don't care how they look, but for such a high priced product it seems like the paint shouldn't immediately chip.",98087521
KEI26,4,12/04/2017,"Pretty good purchase It’s a comfy spike, fits well with my wide feet. However the shinny paint in the bottom comes off pretty easy, but that doesn’t affect its performance",97796893
KEI26,5,04/07/2017,Amazing purchase I read a review saying get a size up and I did I normally wear 12 but I got a 13 and there is a limitless bit of room so I would say get a half size up not a whole,84086019
KEI26,5,03/08/2017,"If you want to be Super Saiyan fast these are for you. These are the best sprint spikes I have ever put on my feet, if you are worried about the price tag, don't. They are worth every single penny, only issue was that I wear a size 11 and I ordered an 11.5 and they were too small, so choose a size up than your actual foot because they run small. The size 12 fits like a sock though.",82600088
KEI26,4,02/19/2017,"Not worth $212. The shoe is great, not $ 212 great but its great, super light barely feel them. I think theyre over priced. The fact that its $212 and you cant change/replace the spikes makes me kind of mad i didnt find that out until i unboxed them. Good shoe nice fit but not worth its price, you can get a shoe just as good for much less.",81757284
KEI26,5,01/27/2017,Best Track Cleats I've ever bought They are Super light and look really cool in my opinion. The most important thing and difference between all the other track cleats is how light they are. And how you can't even feel them on your feet.,80191102

IUU67,5,04/20/2016,Great Distance Spikes I wear a size 7 in my adidas trainers (Adizero Boston Boost) and bought a size 6.5 in these spikes. They fit perfectly! I like my spikes to be a bit more snug so that a form fitting without squishing my toes or being to tight in any places. When I first took these out of the box I was worried becasue they didn't look aggressive enough to force me up on my toes but after working out in them I found out that they were great! This distance spike has a durable sole which is great for cross country and longer events on the track. I am very pleased!,65034043

This foam is also unlikely to have long term deformation problems that you might have experienced with standard EVA foam.

There still is a bit of EVA foam around the rim of the midsole to “keep the foot in a neutral plane” according to Adidas.",98130243

BEZ11,4,09/03/2017,Not the most comfortable I feel like the arch in the left shoe is much higher than the arch in the right which is annoying.The top of the left shoe kind of digs into the top of my foot when I wear thin socks.

BEZ11,1,08/31/2017,"Poor Quality I really liked the style of these shoes, and would have kept them if they weren't defective. I ordered two different pairs and they each had a defect on the arch area of the right shoe. The glue was also coming apart that held the insole in place.",92828707
BEZ11,2,08/27/2017,"Defective Second pair of defective boosts I get from Adidas. And they have this odd ""no exchange policy"" that makes absolutely no sense. Their sizing is completely inconsistent between every single style, which makes it even more difficult to shop online. Also, it's very difficult for them to honor a previous discount for a pair you previously ordered, But because of inconsistencies in sizing and defective shoes, you have to return, wait for a refund, re-order and actually pay more for the new pair. They won't do much to help. Not happy with adidas online. At all. 

My second pair on the part where the laces go, it would not sit flush to the shoe, it would stick out, a lot. Didn't matter how tight I'd tie it, it would still stick out. Both shoes. One in both sides (as pictured) and the other on one, also about 1/2 size smaller than the first pair.

DWG26,4,10/23/2017,"Stylist and Futuristic I really like the Ultraboost laceless. It's a stylish and futuristic looking addition to the Ultraboost family. The black has a clean look because of its single color. I've noticed that others have found the ribbed part of the Primeknit controversial. Some love it or hate it. I found it interesting texturally and visually, but it offers no structural support to your foot like the cage. I don't have to go into the comfort of the Ultraboost itself-it's why this line of shoes is so popular. I think every Adidas shoe should incorporate Ultraboost in some way. So why isn't this review five stars? The Primeknit upper is a different weave compared to the Ultraboost caged and uncaged. Consequently, the shoe feels tighter and less comfortable compared to the caged and uncaged. There is less give and stretch in the toe box. It feels like the Ultraboost laceless runs a half size smaller than marked. You may want to order both your normal size and a half size larger to try.",94613026

But never have this problem.,94537618
DWG26,5,10/20/2017,Unique Looking Laceless Ultra Boost! Been an Ultra Boost fan since first try and have never looked back. Design and comfort is just beyond par. Highly recommended!,94530036
DWG26,4,10/19/2017,"Tight These shoes are great, I get compliments on them every time I wear them. But for the love of god order a half size bigger than normal. Sometimes at the end of the day I cannot wait to take them off. I have had them for about two months now and they are still as tight as when I first received them.",94505916

DWG26,4,10/01/2017,"Extremely comfortable Product is very comfortable. I was worried with no laces it could feel lose or stretch over time, but hasn’t seemed to be an issue.",93740342
DWG26,5,09/28/2017, Most comfortable show and true to size. I'd recommend to anyone.,93679781
DWG26,4,09/24/2017,"New Favorite Shoes These shoes have quickly become the most stylish and comfortable pair of shoes I own. The Adidas Primeknit upper is amazingly well crafted and really does wrap around your foot like a sock. The cushioning on the bottom is equally impressive as well as sturdy and comfortable. I was initially afraid that the laceless design would result in a looser grip on the foot, but not the case. I have had no issues with these shoes slipping off and wear them almost everyday. This is also my first UltraBOOST purchase and I will definitely be buying more in the future.

Update: Still love the shoes, but I have to dock a star. They tend to cause my feet a great deal of discomfort when I wear them for extended periods of time so not ideal for long shifts or all day use.",93510524
DWG26,4,09/17/2017,"Laces are not necessary. I've always thought laces were such an old-fashioned technology so when I heard these were releasing, I knew I had to get a pair, and bought them soon as they were available. 

I'm on my feet all day at work, so I just love Boost. I'm a big fan of the uncaged Ultra Boost and NMD City Socks, and though the former has laces, I felt they were ornamental. This new laceless version of Ultra Boost fits differently than the two previously mentioned shoes, in that the extra banding of elastic accurately replaces the feeling of tighter laces, where the CS feels looser, at least to my foot and in the same size (US13). The uncaged UB were snug when I first got them but never as much in the lace area, and I'm not certain I prefer this new fit, though I'm sure it's better for my foot than the way I wear my UB's (loose-laced). 

I did take off a star from the overall rating mostly because of the cuff on them. It's a different cuff than that of the Ultra Boost cuff that I absolutely love. This feels less like clothing and more like a strap or a tight waistband and there's stitching on the back that rubbed the back of my ankle like crazy and I had to put a band-aid on to make it through the rest of my day at work. That might be just my pair, as I noticed it more on one ankle than the other. 

If these had the sock-like uncaged cuff, these would be my perfect pair of sneakers. I'm hoping if I wear them more they'll loosen up in the right places and fit closer to the uncaged pair I was wearing regularly before I got these.

Overall, they're a great sneaker, just hope next time they feature the softer sock-like cuffs that I love.",93326490
DWG26,5,09/15/2017,"Extremely comfortable and eye catchy The shoe is amazingly comfortable. When I ordered this shoe I thought, it was a bit expensive one but $200 shoe worth every penny. Seriously. I am really happy about it.",93290909
DWG26,5,09/14/2017,"O....M...G....!!!! Most perfect and comfortable shoes....EVER. The primeknit is light yet extraordinarily sturdy, and literally hugs my feet snuggly with ultimate support. And the Boost sole cushion is unbelievable. Having plantar fasciatias, running puts a huge strain on my feet, but not with these shoes. And...they look fly! $200 and worth every penny. Seriously.",93263566
DWG26,5,09/11/2017,"New Favorite Ultra Boost! For those who are wondering how the fit it is, they feel like the conventional Ultra Boost 3.0 with the laces tied more on the tight side. More stability due to the fact that the midfoot area is bit more snug. 

Primeknit is also less giving compared to the 3.0. Due to the knit material used, this does not have the sock like feeling which I didn't like anyways.

Overall, a great shoe and my new favorite. You can't go wrong with boosts!",93126453
DWG26,5,09/09/2017,"Incredibly comfortable with a similar feel to the Ultraboost Uncaged. Perfect everyday comfort and a great minimal clean style. Very similar in feel to the Uncaged by slightly more snug around the mid-foot. You can create a bit more room in the shoe by removing the inner soles (especially good if you’re going with thicker socks). However over a couple of days it feels like the shoes has loosened slightly and has become even more comfortable. 

Running: Yes you can run in this shoe but I would not recommend anything over a couple of miles and certainly nothing that involved quick cuts or serious change in direction. I’m a very neutral with normal width feet (sz12) and while they feel a little snug at first, they quickly feel too loose on a relatively fast run. In short they feel less of a serious running shoe than the Ultraboost and the Ultraboost uncaged (no surprises there). Of course how many Ultraboosts do you see out running?

Aesthetics: The Laceless is a totally different aesthetic than the standard Ultraboost and Uncaged. Comparing them is a little tough but the Laceless feel overall more modern and minimal. Almost Apple-like in its rethink of what a shoe could be.",93075928
DWG26,5,09/09/2017,Excellent More comfortable than my Yeezy 350V2 Cream White .,93066972
DWG26,5,09/06/2017,"Extremely comfortable and aesthetically pleasing This shoe is absolutely phenomenal. I own a few boost shoes and in terms of comfort the laceless silhouette compares very well to the ultra boost, if not better. It does fit slightly snug out of the box, however that is expected given the construction of the shoe. All in all this is an amazing product and I WILL be getting the other colorways.",93015103
DWG26,4,09/05/2017,"Unique addition to the Ultra Boost family. This silhouette is very appealing visually and they're comfortable (of course they're comfortable) but they run TIGHT on your foot, so going a half size up is probably your best bet. I'm concerned about wearing them for an extended period of time because of how tight they are. Otherwise, great sneaker.",92985653

DWG18,5,12/21/2017,"Most comfortable shoe EVER! I have tried almost every shoe out there but the Adidas Ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe ever and I highly recommend it even for wide feet with a high in-step. I searched for almost a year to find a shoe that would help with all my ailments. I have a sore lower back, bad knees with a torn meniscus, and plantar fasciitis and yet I can walk all day in these shoes as the cushioned sole absorbs much of the shock when walking. My pain goes away. I am going to buy another pair in a different colour. I'm glad you came out with beige which I will order but I'd like to see a black upper with a black sole so it looks more like a dress shoe which I can wear at work.

So tried to get the 1/2 size smaller and by the time I received it - my size was sold out! Adidas please make more product in smaller sizes! (For reference I'm normally a 6 and need a 5.5 in this one). Other than that - the shoe itself is very comfortable and stylish. Just beware of the sizing.",97726087

DWG12,4,11/06/2017,"Get rid of the annoying foot cage part These have been great for running, I love the arch support and the level of cushion. I have a very high arch and I love the floating arch. I think I might be the only person who preferred the deeper fit and higher back of the original pure boost. That style was more natural feeling on my foot, like I wasn’t wearkng a shoe at all. The flexible knit upper on this shoe is great, albeit shallow compared to the old pure, but much negated by the weird hard plastic cage thing around the midfoot. These run a bit long for me, so the cage will press on my baby toe a little. I can notice it when I run but it doesn’t bother me as much running as it does when I’ve worn these around.

I have a pair of the regular UltraBoost and love them. Wished the purple color came in the original UltraBoost style.

Not to mention, this shoe is extremely stylish, which I find can be hard to find among good running shoes.

I was initially skeptical because of the unattached cage, but find that it doesn't hinder my running at all.

I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of running shoes before, they usually fell good the first run. Not these...I went on 5 runs and the last one I had to walk home because my foot hurt so bad. It hurt on the outside ball of my foot, only on one side. Needless to say, they were returned.",93031267
DWG12,4,09/06/2017,Love these! I love these! So chic! You get lots of compliments. I might add I do not run. I use them for strength training.,93019715
DWG12,2,09/06/2017,Not a real running shoe These were made for women who run but the arch is too high (I have normal arches) and the material is too tight. They do feel like you get a bounce in them but it really is not made for running. I run 3 miles 2 times a week on sidewalk pavement.,92987450
DWG12,3,09/02/2017,"Not super functional These are super chic and comfortable trainers, but that being said, they're not a performance running shoe. I also found they weren't structured enough for weight lifting/HIIT (not enough ankle stability). I think these could work for walking/jogging, but if you're a serious runner, you should know they're way too heavy for speedwork. The bootie is also not super snug like Nike flyknit, so you slosh around a lot, and because of the weight of the shoe, I found this really impacted my stride. If you're looking for a great looking shoe to kick around in, these are perfect, but after around 200 miles in them, I just don't think they're a great running shoe.",92882837
DWG12,1,08/28/2017,"Dont waste your money I'm not a hard core runner but I like to run 4-5 miles a few times a week. I was in the market for some new running shoes and thought I would give these a try cause they look so awesome in pictures. They felt heavy compared to my past shoes and the back heel is gigantic, there was at least an extra inch of material behind where my heel would end, which pushes the rest of the foot forward as you run. I thought maybe that extra heel was for more support but then about 2 miles into my run all of a sudden the heel caught and I rolled my ankle pretty bad. Took the shoes off and walked home barefoot. So if you are buying these shoes for running please save your money. If you are buying them cause you think they ""look cool"" and want to wear them around town, probably fine.",92719729
DWG43,5,12/29/2017,"Great shoe, I like them better than the 3.0’s. The ultra boost 4.0’s are very comfortable and have a great design.",98580016
DWG43,4,12/29/2017,New stitching is more like the 2.0 which i love just wasnt aware when i copped... will buy 12.5 in 4.0 from now on SVINTBOOST on twitter ... adidas group career is my dreeeam,98579462

DWG43,5,12/28/2017,Comfortable as ever. The adidas 4.0 is by far the best as far as comfort and design I'm am very happy with my purchase my only suggestion would be to go a half size down so it can fit just snug around the toes if you stay true to size you might feel it a little loose around the toes where it would feel like you have clown feet.,98568118
DWG43,4,12/28/2017,Quality running or everyday shoe. The Ultra Boost is extremely comfortable but seems to run a little snug so i recommend going half a size larger than usual or taking out the insole.,98563679

DWG43,5,12/12/2017,"Better than its Predecessors This is the best Ultra Boost to date; this 4.0 model fits snug and true-to-size, the primeknit pattern is simple, modern, and not overdone - it just looks clean (some may prefer the primeknit patterns on older models, but this to me is the Ultra Boost series at its cleanest and non-flashiest - if that is your preference). They removed the translucent caging introduced in the 3.0s (that ended up looking like cheap, low-quality plastic) and brought back the solid cage from the 1.0s and 2.0s to the 4.0s and it does make a huge difference. Another one of the most noticeable differences is that they have removed the silver ""Ultra Boost"" text located on the heel of the foot and replaced it in a glossy black finish, making the shoe look more subtle and modern in comparison to its predecessors. This also makes the shoes look much less of a ""hypebeast"" shoe and can be worn comfortably by anyone who just simply wants to transition into the world of Boost technology and ""ultra"" comfort, without consequently needing to be labeled as a ""hypebeast"" simply for wearing a pair of Ultra Boosts. In addition to that, they have changed the text found on the soles of shoes to a bubbly font - which, though I am not quite fond of, is still not a deal-breaker when contemplating whether or not to pick-up a pair of these amazing sneakers, which are an excellent choice for athletics and mature daily-wear sneakers - as these are no longer as ""loud"" as its predecessors or any other sneaker out right now. If you are a hypebeast hoping for the 4.0 model to have been something completely wild and different, this is not the shoe for you. If you're someone who is just simply wanting to own a pair, pick it up - now. You will NOT regret it. If you're somebody who already owns a pair or multiple pairs of Ultra Boosts, is it worth the upgrade? - In my opinion, no, not for the hefty price tag (but justified, due to versatility and comfort). If you like the new design on the 4.0s or you're just a hypebeast that needs to cop everything, however, then go for it.",98051808

DWG43,4,12/04/2017,Not a fan of the new pattern UB has been one of my favorite silhouettes and version 1.0 as my all time favorite because of the knit pattern. I purchased UB 4.0 because it has some of the UB 1.0 pattern with additional parallel lines running from toe to heel which I'm not a fan of. To me that ruined the otherwise perfect pattern.

I was nervous because I have wide feet but felt that they fit fine going down a half size. The prime knit stretched and formed to my feet without a weird bulge. 
The insole feels thicker then usual but didn’t seem to bother me. There’s still room in front of my toes but the right amount. I compared them to my 1.0 versions. They feel almost the same. I’m sure I could have gone true to size but going down a half size didn’t hurt.

With the 3.0s triple black etc. you could see your toes poking out the top even though you had plenty of space length ways. It was a lighter mesh.

DWG43,2,11/20/2017,"Primeknit upper wraps way too rigid and not flexible I really like the boost technology and the ultra boost. 
I had to buy a new pair after reaching the limit of my previous pair but unfortunately after three days wearing them I arrive to this conclusion: the new Primeknit upper wraps is way too rigid and heavier. It compress the feet in the shoes constantly. It also keep my feet a bit too warm because of that.
I have the right size in term of length and width so I was a bit confused since there should not be any difference with my previous pair. 
If I order half a size bigger I believe I would have too much space on the front but maybe I should have done that.

DWG63,5,11/27/2017,Great shoe would recommend to anyone I just got these yesterday and they fit great feel comfortable and overall look amazing. The only potential problem I could see for me atleast is they are a bit narrow. Over all though these shoes areally awesome!,97530753

DWG63,5,11/24/2017,"Awesome, but... superior quality, great boost comfort. I recommend getting 1/2 to 1 size smaller than other brand. I am usually a size 9 on Nike, and I feel 8.5 is still big. will exchange for sz 8. The only thing that bothers me is that the wing of the shoe tongue folds up. Great pick if you don't want to spend $180 for ultra boost",97477456
DWH96,4,12/23/2017,"Color looks different but great shoe I can't complain for $68 and the shoe is great but the color looks quite different than the Adidas photos, they are very pink and orange compared to looking quite toned down on Adidas.com",98397805

KEK85,4,10/26/2017,"Good for running I struggle to find good running shoes. I settled on these abot a year ago, and they have served me well. They have not caused shin splints or blisters (as some other shoes I tried have). However, they are not holding up well. I have put just under 300 miles on them, and they have holes forming in the inner heel, the traction is GONE, and the road is now eating into the energy boost sole as I run. I dont see how these are comparable to tire rubber, as I should have been able to put more miles on them before retiring them (especially for the $140 I paid) . Also, they feel cheeply made. Some of the stitching seems incomplete and the lining unfinished. I accepted this over time as a consequence of the shoes being so light. They are the lightest shoes I have ever owned. They are breathable. And they do hold my foot securely as I run. Unfortunately, another issue is that they are a pain to get on. A complete pain! With no pull tab in the back, I find myself attempting to get them on over and over, and crushing my fingers as I try to pull them open with forcing my foot in. The heel ends up folding in under my foot, and I have to try again. It is unpleasant, and could be easily fixed with a pull tab. Another complain is the Suede material used on the toe and front of the shoe. It collects so much dirt. I have scrubbed my shoes clean, went for one run, and came back with them looking just as bad as before I cleaned them. (And I mostly run on pavement). Also, the laces have stretched a bit and are so long that I have to triple tie them so they don’t drag the ground. Overall I give 4 stars because they have served my purposes of a supportive running shoe, are good for sprints and long distance, attractive, prevent common injuries in long distance runs, and are good enough for me to buy a second pair to break in before a half marathon.",94961748

KEK85,5,10/10/2017,"Favorite training and racing shoe This is the ideal shoe for training and racing if you're looking for a lighter shoe with a neutral fit. It's lean and light, yet provides ample protection. The only issue I have is that the side of the tongue can get bunched up and cause pressure points on the inner top side of the foot; you have to remember to smooth the tongue inside the shoe as you put the shoe on. I have a hard time finding performance shoes that fit properly, and these felt perfect when I first tried them on - like Cinderella and that magic slipper. Good lacing system enables custom fit and no heel sloppiness. They have good aeration so you won't get excessive sweat and they dry quickly (removable sock liner, too). I just retired a pair at 921 miles - a bit more than I'd recommend wearing them for. (They were noticeably less bouncy around 800 miles or so; online reviews/forums seems to recommend replacement at 600 mi max.)",94175309

CDB64,1,12/28/2017,"Good Response but Bad Quality When I received the shoes, I was excited to try them out, so I threw them on for a 5 mile run. Here were my thoughts.

The Good: Shoes had above average responsiveness. The Continental rubber on the sole was awesome and very grippy. I liked the color option.

The Bad: They had less cushion than I expected from the Boost material and for the class/type of shoe they are. Fit and Finish Quality was poor - the shoes fit differently between left/right shoe. To elaborate, please reference the attached photo. Orange heel band is placed differently, some of the other materials are different heights. Just very very poor quality on these shoes.

It is possible if the pair I had received was matching, that the shoes would have worked better for me, but I can't confirm that and won't be purchasing another pair to try. Overall, while they were responsive and the sole was fantastic, I wouldn't recommend these shoes (even as a 'race only' shoe) because of the poor quality and below average cushion for the shoe class.",98537608

I suspect it's lower than the 10mm drop claimed in the details about the shoe. Nothing wrong with lower drop shoes, but I wanted a standard drop 10-12mm, and I really don't think this stack height description is accurate. Aside from that, it's an excellent, light-enough option for races up to a marathon, and a great every day trainer if you're a sub-3 marathoner.",94343358

I will say now that I have tryed Adidas's other boost shoes, it's implementation here wasn't the ""most squishy"". It was, however, the most springy. Everyone compares boost to the ultraboost for running, but I have to say that I would take these any day. The Boston 6 is super light! Even for a shoe with boost. I didn't notice the boost ""in every step"". Rather, I noticed how great my feet and legs felt after a run as compared to other clunky running shoes. It was as if I didn't have to try as hard to pick up my feet after striking the ground. The shoes really protected my joints! I have ran over 400 miles in these, and they still feel really great, with the boost not even losing its form.

The Bostons have a nice firm feel of the road (not squishy and over-cushioned). And of course the Boost comes as advertised: the energy return on toe off is obvious.

CDB65,4,12/07/2017,"Very comfortable running shoes. Function is great, look and form not so much I live in Quebec. The shoes arrived very swiftly (2 days). It's also a bonus that I only paid $52 for them since it was Black Friday sale. I love how comfortable and well-fitting they are. I wear size 10 and do not have narrow feet at all, but these fit like gloves so that's awesome. They are also quite flexible while giving enough stability as well. The shoes are very light when worn and has great propelling properties when you run. My only gripes are the colour and form. The colour is a kind of muddy dark brown with dark green-ish hue. Well either way, just not appealing at all since it reminds me of the colour of mold. I would much prefer if the shoes were pure black. The form is slim fitting which does not make your feet seem big. But they can look a bit unelegant in some parts especially the tip or the curves. Nevertheless, they are fanstastic in functionality and one of the most comfortable pairs I own. If you don't mind the looks, I would highly recommend these running shoes.",97898398
CDB65,5,11/20/2017,"Best purchase ever I have a hard time finding sneakers to fit me and I am very picky on my sneakers. They have to be light yet give enough cushion for my running. I’m trying to go to sneakers like the five-finger sneakers and the adizero brand I find are the best and it’s amazing I can order a pair online and know they are going to be a perfect fit, which i cant do with any other company!!!",97322113

CDB65,4,10/08/2017,Looking forward to getting the larger size These shoes are just beautiful: aesthetically they're one of the best pair of shoes I've bought. Quite narrow (although that's nice in a running shoe) and a little small (so I've had to send these back and order the larger size so fingers crossed). The grip on the sole is extensive and perfect for slippy conditions and the mesh on the side might make them very breathable if not-waterproof.,94034143
CDB65,2,09/30/2017," Size running small, the shoe look solid but leak of new design idea.
Mesh on the front, no rain repel, not recommended",93723944
CDB65,3,09/28/2017,"Lightweight, supportive but not enough boost The trainer is very lightweight and they feel supportive on running.
I previously owned the ultra boost and the boost on these shoes are not noticeable at all. The inside instep on the shoe is also built up quite high which caused me inside arch pain after approx 2 miles.",93668384

BDZ41,5,10/27/2017,"Very cool shoes! Just got these today, feel great on my feet! I do see what people mean by the size seeming large. There is more space past my toes than I'm used to, but everything feels great for running, jumping, etc., so I can't tell if that's a design thing. You probably CAN go a half size down if desired and have them still fit well! Love the look! Love the feel on my feet! Extremely happy with this purchase and expect I'll be ordering more from Adidas soon!!",95020795
BDZ41,4,10/25/2017,good for training I bought t these for running which was a mistake because these shoes are best for training and in case weight lifting these sneakers are great. but not good for running. therefore I returned them.,94838634

I can wear them for hours, so comfy! Faded peachy orange color is beautiful in person, and it has that yeezy's look :D. Also I really like the bottoms of these.

I usually wear 8.5, that's what I got and it feels perfect but not too tight of a fit. Would recommended 100000%",93320380
BDZ41,5,09/14/2017,"Stylish, but not what I was expecting I like the shoes in the aspect of style, but I was highly expecting for them to be super comfortable as well. I walk a lot during the day, and I don't get as much support on my heels like I hoped. I got a 9.5 instead of my regular shoe size which is a 10, but I should have bought a size 9 instead because my shoes fit pretty big on my feet. One thing I like about the shoes is the width and being able to tighten my shoes on my mid foot, especially after ordering a bigger shoe size.",93268352

BDZ40,4,12/18/2017,"Run a little big but look good and are comfy I like these as casual shoes to wear around with joggers. They’re a bit long so they don’t fit my foot well enough to run in, but a half size down are too tight.",98249302

So I ordered them 8.5 and they’re too big. An 8 would have been fine. I ordered them on sale for half off, and now the only way I can get an 8 is if I return them and reorder an 8 at full price since adidas online doesn’t do exchanges.

Ive always felt forced into a clunky unflattering shoes, usually donned in bright colors that were never ""me"" because thats whats usually available for women. We get rainbows and men get the sleek, unassuming ""cool"" shoes. Well needless to say, i am very happy with this purchase. The color is a cool oatmeal - not white. Which is fine for me, i love them. And also the other reviews are correct. these run BIG. I ordered 1/2 size down (i wear a 6.5 so i ordered a 6) and the fit is still roomy enough so that they fit but I can comfortably wear socks with them when needed.

BDZ40,3,07/03/2017," I love my other pair of alphabounce shoes, but there fit completely different. They're not as comfortable. Adidas has since added better photos, but when I ordered them they were shown to be an ice light pink, but they're very bright almost neon peach",89666660
BDZ40,2,07/01/2017,not comfortable The shoe looks nice. It's not as comfortable as I was expecting it to be. I would return them but I've already worn them quite a bit in hopes that I would break them in.,89558753

CDN45,2,11/19/2017,The shoes are great in appearance and construction. The problem is that the Alphabounce shoes are just too narrow to be comfortable to run and work o Unfortunately I do not like the shoes because they are too narrow to comfortably workout in.,97287053

BDZ11,5,12/22/2017,"i love these booties ..super comfortable and cool I love these sneakers. they are great for the gym and running outside. the sole has so much bounce to it literally. they literally make you bounce around..lol
I have a very high instep so zipping it is kinda tight but they fit great otherwise. I really only notice the tightness when i am not up and moving when i am active the shoe stretches perfectly. these are definitely owrth the money.",98380310
BDZ11,5,12/22/2017, Perfect product. Keep watching to see in long time after.,98372144
BDZ11,2,12/21/2017, Right size but Could not zip up the closure. If your have a med to high arch these sneakers are not for you.,98355457
BDZ11,5,12/21/2017,Very satisfied with these sneakers. Very comfortable sneakers. Wore them for 2 consecutive days and I could go from cardio to weight training without missing a beat. The cushioning and the support was awesome.,98347273
BDZ11,1,12/21/2017,Do not fit AT ALL I wear a 10 across multiple brands. This is definitely the equivalent of a 7 or 8. Wouldn't even zip up. Freaking ridiculous.,98331969
BDZ11,5,12/19/2017,Great fit for a quarter top running shoe I like how this shoe fits like a glove on my foot. The zipper feature makes it easy to get in and out but at the same time offer some level of support on the upper forefoot. Well cushioned on the bottom sole which makes walking or running pure joy for my feet. Love the design and color scheme. I also picked up the all black version as a second pair.,98290380

BDZ11,5,12/18/2017,"Design at its best I always wondered what would come after the Adidas Vigor 5 Trail Running shoes, and then these shoes showed up online. Are these one of the best looking and comfortable shoes on the market. I think i will stick to Adidas for life is they keep making such awesome shoes. Fits like a glove on my feet.",98261711
BDZ11,5,12/18/2017,"Best athletic shoe for casual wear and hardcore athletes. Let’s face it, we don’t need 49 pairs of $100 shoes for every event. I struggle so hard to find a practical jogging/gym shoe that I can pair with some skinny straight jeans and go out in public without looking like I forgot my fanny pack. The 5.8 mids are warm, stylish, they are perfect for running, the grip is great, the only downside is you need to go 1/2-full size up. Once broken in the zippers do work well, but the inside of the shoe has a thick guard that makes sizing Tricky. I usually wear a 9.5 and a 10 fit perfectly, a little tight on the right at first, but stretching out nicely.",98257993
BDZ11,5,12/18/2017,"Best for winter Great value, wonderful product.
Really comfy and stylish",98256684

BDZ11,5,12/16/2017,If you don't have wide feet like myself they are the most comfortable shoes ever. I really like them for how cool they look!!!! Plus they keep your feet really warm in cool weather.,98193866
BDZ11,4,12/14/2017,"Very good fit and quality but no laces!! Was not aware of no laces based on description. Not sure If I will be able to use these to actually play basketball, have not tried yet. Comfortable for everyday use.",98136747
BDZ11,5,12/13/2017,"Excellent Shoes These are my second pair of Alpha Bounce sneakers. I used a normal lace pair for the summer, which I still have and are in great shape after 6 months of heavy use. I bought these for the ""winterized"" feature, and couldn't be happier. Fit the same as the other pair, a perfect 10.5 (for me at least), and the booty design is great. Distinctly warmer than the lighter weight pair. Much heartier tread. Have yet to test their water resistance though. I am optimistic they will be good enough in light snow. They definitely are not snow boots.",98108861

BDZ11,4,12/11/2017,"A solid winterized sneaker option Length and width run true.
Inner liner and water resistant upper material kept my feet warm and dry in light snow. 
The traction on the shoe is a plus for all weather conditions.",98034280
BDZ11,5,12/10/2017,"Very durable and comfortable These shoes are really good for walking around urban terrain in. The grip on the bottom from Continental makes it ideal for any surface. They are very comfortable, as well, and you can feel the bounce when you walk.",97987812
BDZ11,3,12/09/2017,Wish they fit I dont like because if you wear a 10.5 you will probably want to order an 11.5 or 12,97960610
BDZ11,1,12/07/2017,"Zipper would not zip =[ Love everything about these shoes but could not even zip the zipper an inch. I have 3 other alphabounce pairs that are the same size that fit great but this one does not. Love the colors, patterns, and outsole of this model but it just wont fit. I should have read the reviews that mention wide feet first.",97917410
BDZ11,4,12/07/2017,"Zip won't close with socks I usually wear a size 9, I ordered 9.5 for this one, and still it takes a struggle to close the zip and I don't even have big/fat feet , I have skinny feet. After I removed my socks the zip closed, but I cannot use them without the socks.",97901374
BDZ11,4,12/05/2017,"Unusual,cool shoe. I bought these as a backup when my first choice wasn’t available. They arrived & I was pleasantly surprised.

BDZ11,5,12/04/2017," This boot is stylish with a unique look. It fits the foot snuggly and when called upon to deliver sports movements just zip it up. 
I bought them for the cold winter months and I can safely say they are like slippers, keeping my feet warm as well as dry. Great utility shoe at any price.",97806269
BDZ11,1,12/04/2017, I’d like to send them back. I wish they were all black. I was turned by the grey overtone of the sneaker.,97798894
BDZ11,5,12/03/2017,Exactly what I was looking for in a warmer shoe for the winter Wanted a higher shoe with added warmth for colder weather. With these the thick inner lining and the zipper enclosure provide just what I needed. And the Bounce technology is the most comfortable I've ever walked in! Will buy again in a low cut shoe for summer.,97746931
BDZ11,3,12/03/2017,"Comfortable but weird looking Theyre nice shoes but i walked in and my roommate said ""wow those are really nothing like ive ever seen before"" so take that as youd like",97735214
BDZ11,4,12/02/2017,"Legitimate running shoes These shoes are comfortable, however as others have mentioned they are a bit snug due to how the inner part works. If you are close to needing the next size in what you normally where definitely consider going up. I have done a couple of trail runs in theses. The grip is fantastic. The outer layer serves as a gaiter, helping to keep out debris. The convenience of just having to zip them up is great.",97727051
BDZ11,1,12/01/2017,Loved how they looked but size weird I loved how they looked and would love to wear them but the size length was was perfect but could not zip them up and had to return them unfortunately,97704066
BDZ11,5,11/27/2017,overall great although uncomfortable first when worn in is great,97525790
BDZ11,1,11/23/2017, sole is very hard like walking direct on concrete. I was expecting a soft sole when I saw the picture of the shoes on the website.,97455162
BDZ11,5,11/18/2017,Underpriced for what they are I got the size a half size too big and they’re perfect,97278345
BDZ11,2,11/17/2017,Almost perfect I ordered a sz 9.5 and when I tried them on it was a perfect fit except I couldn't zip up the zipper. I wouldn't recommend this shoe if you have wide feet.,97262407
BDZ11,2,11/17/2017,even that it was the same size but I couldn't put my feet in good quality but the size is not perfect and I post it back and received nothing from Adidas,97245901

BDZ11,5,11/05/2017,"Great shoes. The back heel/side ankle support cushion could be higher and should hug the ankles better. Sleek design, practical and comfortable.

BDZ11,5,10/31/2017,"It's pretty cool shoes the width is little tight, not that easy to take on or take off",95786932
BDZ11,3,10/25/2017,"Lots of Potential This sneaker REALLY appealed to me in terms of aesthetics, and that traction looked phenomenal for winter. I know adidas in no way advertised them as water resistant or anything of the sort, but ""weather resistant"" makes it seem as if it would at least repel water slightly. The upper *absorbs* water so this unfortunately will not suit my winter needs. The length of the shoe is a bit long and the width is a bit narrow (compared to Ultraboosts in the same size). The traction in person was as aggressive as the pictures depict, and the Continental rubber compound only enhances that. I wouldn't recommend this for the winter, but would without a doubt recommend them for the fall.",94728733

BDZ11,3,10/11/2017,"Not water repellent After read the other reviews went half size up, fits perfect and overall pretty comfortable, saw its winterized with water repellent treatment, so I wore it on a rainy day, turn out the upper absorb water right away instead of keep them out.

I have always fit perfectly into size 9 Adidas shoes whether Performance or Originals, however, this particular shoe seems to fit a little on the small size which makes the fit a little awkward from what I'm usually used to.

If that's the case, this shoe is an improvement over all the complaints I may have had of the Kanadia. This shoe fits true to what I feel is the typical Adidas fit. Its comfortable—it has cushion in just the right spots and doesn't have a hard sewn tongue. It also looks every bit as good as the Kanadia did.",82643069

When I first tried them on, and when I first walked them through their initial week long break-in, they were the most comfortable shoes I had ever worn. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking if I only brought these shoes on my trip to NYC I'd be a happy camper. Sadly, I wore these shoes for 3 days straight walking extensively through NYC and surrounding areas, and found my feet and ankles extremely swollen, my heels rubbed raw, my toes blistered, and by the third day was ready to throw them into the Hudson River as I couldn't bear to take another step in these shoes.

KEJ77,4,06/23/2017,"Full support and true to size. I read other reviews prior to purchase as I was looking for an everyday shoe with exceptional comfort and support.

KEJ77,5,06/19/2017," Awesome shoes! I was actually looking for the Adidas Thrasher running shoes because I have owned a few pair for running and working out at the gym. They were my go-to athletic shoes. I guess Adidas doesn't make the Thrashers anymore and while looking into it I discovered the Rockadias. It turns out they are identical to the Thrasher with a different color scheme. I ordered them and when I received them I compared them to my old Thrashers. They are the same model and fit great. I'm super happy to find these. One thing I will mention when ordering these online is that the highlight color apppears to be red on a screen, but the actual color is not red. It's a neon salmon color, fyi. Still awesome shoes. I'm happy :)",88921210
KEJ77,5,06/16/2017, I'm on my feet all day and I need comfort. I have a previous back injury and I can't just wear any shoe. I've tried other's but my Addidas are the only way to go.,88781885
KEJ77,5,06/16/2017,"A sturdy, stable shoe These are my favorite shoes and when ADIDAS takes breaks from making them, I fall into deep depression. 

Okay not really, but here's why I think they're great. I overpronate and have PFS in both knees, so I wear orthotics and choose my shoes carefully. The extra grip of these shoes is perfect for giving me added stability where my knees lack it. The curved front is great for helping me flex my ankle more fully and for staying on the balls of my feet more, also helpful on the knee problems. I have proportionally narrower heels, and it's incredibly comfortable and well-fitting tkchave the backs come up higher- no blisters or chafing like some shoes. They are not the lightest weight shoe out there, but they are firm and sturdy and make me feel sure of every step- trail, sidewalk, or treadmill. They also last a ridiculously long time, despite my attempts to destroy pairs that are too old for running in sports, camping, and other activities.",88732601

CDA71,4,11/13/2017,"Super luxe sneakers I am a month or so into actually using these shoes for running. They're very comfortable and super well cushioned. I have to say that so far, since using these instead of my usual Ultraboost STs, I am getting some mild shin splints. I don't know if it's only the fault of the shoes or if I just require a more supportive pair of running shoes. In any case, they're super pretty and unique so even if I stop running in them, they're great for wearing on the street.",97026162

I don't know if this is something common with the ultraboosts but there are little pieces that look like they're missing from the boost material.

CDC30,5,11/04/2017,Best running show I’ve had! I love these pair of shoes! I am usually either an 8.5 or an 8. I ordered an 8.5 and the fit was perfect! So if you’re usually in between two different sizes... I would choose the larger one you can fit into. Also the sole of this shoe must have like heightened spots on the bottom for optimum running potential. But this shoe is defiantly a running/jogging/leisure shoe. Do NOT try and lift weight/do lunges with them. I tried doing lunges and my feet kept slipping on the floor. I would recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a new running shoe!,96608441

I looked about for ages, all different brands, and then tried loads of the Boost trainers on in store and chose these. 
Love the colour of them, they look so cool on, but in terms of comfort they are great. I love the inner sole on these, I've got a pretty high arch and these shoes suit so well. They aren't as spongey at the front of the shoe, but i think I'm just getting used to them. 
I did have to go up a size in these. with all the ones i tried on, the styles with the gap underneath the arch have a bit less give i think.",94918468

CDI86,4,12/09/2017,"Excellent shoe Excellent light-weight running shoe. Blue color is beautiful.  Strong heel support. Very comfortable except for the cuff at the ankle -a little tight, but tolerable (my reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Will see if it loosens up over time.",97957764
CDI86,5,12/06/2017,"Nice design and good quality Good quality but it fits my bae small, but the shoes is really good the design was great and very comfortable.",97867697

Check out the out sole .",97633643
CDI86,5,11/18/2017,Great look One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. So light and excellent quality.,97266766
CDI86,5,11/18/2017,"Cool, comfortable and for a good cause! Love these Parley Ultra Boost, glad I got them for an incredible price. Though size is a little tight (it’s a half size too small), these Ultra Boost are still ultra comfortable!",97265751
CDI86,4,11/17/2017,"Very comfy only that it's tighter than regular uncaged boost. I own both women size 6 regular uncaged, and the men size 5 parley uncaged. Lengths of the two pairs are almost the same. However, the parley is much tighter, I think this is because they are using a different material for the upper.",97254308
CDI86,5,10/28/2017,"Snug fit that needs breaking in period Great on runs and as fashionable like my NMD's. Wore this on my flight back from Portland to LA for a 2.5 hour flight. Due to it being new, the Mid foot was a bit tight and you feel it after seating for that long. Parley uncaged needs break in period. I only felt that tightness after seating that long, but when I started walking again tightness to my midfoot disappears. 
The boost is excellent. I have NMD R1, R2 and Pureboost DPR.  The Parley is definitely a running and lifestyle shoe.  The boost on the Parley felt the more bouncy than my other boost - keeping you in full comfort both running and walking.  
It is lifestyle as well as you have so many options to lace this. I wanted 3 (adidas) lace to stand out and I was able to do it with lacing. 
I have wide feet 9.5, and I got 9.5 and it is true to fit. Get a half size larger (for wide feet) if you plan more on just walking around this and you love your wiggle room for your toes.  Having wore this for 8 hours, with 2 straight hours of standing - this by far the most comfortable Adidas boost.",95218123
CDI86,4,10/25/2017,Great buy! I don't like the fact that the lowest layer of the shoe is white. It gets dirty quickly.,94821028
CDI86,4,10/20/2017,Cool but fitted Love the look of this shoe. Pretty narrow last combined with the knit makes it fitted. Suggest sizing up 1 or even 1.5 if you don't like a snug toe box. The size 11 in these are the same length as the size 10 in the Pureboost.,94534599

CDI86,4,08/14/2017,"Nice shoe more show than go Great shoe but durability is the question, so do not expect to do nothing more than being able to run and maybe do a few lifts like deadlift and squats, not really that durable for a lot of cardio related stuff. Not ladder drills. So from a gym point of view deadlifts and squats are a go, but avoid dynamic stuff (high knees etc.) or stitchings will begin to separate from the shoe quite quickly.",92022160

CDI86,3,07/01/2017,"Great shoe and action comfort...but re-think the built in sock design ""sock"" (built in ankle sock) is too tight and makes it difficult to put on and take off. If you are not always active (walking or running), the shoe gets very uncomfortable with the choking sock.",89558431
CDI86,5,06/30/2017,GREAT SHOE!! Great product one of best shoes adidas has came out with!,89542930
CDI86,1,06/30/2017,Regret Got a one too small seems like only a half size smaller than what I need but they already started hurted the back of my foot. The sick part and hardish part at the back of the shoe where they meet scraped my foot and cut it a bit. Not satisfied and these shoes were expensive and hard to replace when they are gone in a day on here.,89527893
CDI86,5,06/28/2017,Best design It's really comfortable and lightweight. The ultraboost sole is technically great and supported,89299331

CDI86,5,06/25/2017,KUDOS TO PARLEY X ADIDAS! THE SHOES ARE DOPE. THE CAUSE IS REAL. These feel much better to me than the normal primeknit material - not quite as stretchy and more durable. If you make a quick cut it doesnt feel like your foot is going to bust through the upper like the normal primeknits do. ALSO - PARLEY IS AWESOME AND KUDOS TO ADIDAS FOR SUPPORTING THEIR CAUSE.,89165440
CDI86,5,06/24/2017,Instantly made it to the top of the rotation They look better on feet then they do in the picture very comfy I'm almost true to size it is really tight at first but it does stretch out. Afterwords it is just as comfy as a regular uncaged ultra boost,89111761

CDI86,5,06/23/2017,"Looks good, feels good. Great shoes This product is so comfortable! It's like wearing socks not to mention how bouncy the sole is. They were my first pair of ultraboost shoes and the colour is absolutely beautiful. It's also great to know that the collaboration between adidas and parley means that some the product uses some ocean plastic in the knit in the shoe. Amazing shoes.",89069329

CDI86,5,06/09/2017,Good product I like the product a lot but I think by now Adidas should have dropped the price since it's been available for so long.,88037783
CDI86,4,06/09/2017,"Very happy with my purchase. This is a very light shoe with an awesome colour. I can hardly tell I'm wearing them. They do run slightly small (my usual size was okay lengthwise, but too tight - feet would be numb after an hour of wearing them, due to poor circulation), so I'd recommend 1/2 a size bigger than usual. The difference might not be that noticeable when it comes to length, but it will be regarding the tightness of the shoe. They do adjust to your foot in time - I think the material stretches slightly, but no so much that they would be too big all of a sudden. When running in them, they give you a bit of a spring. They are also great for longer walks. I would definitely recommend this shoe.",88019418
CDI86,4,06/09/2017,"Size up. Really nice looking - probably the best colour I've seen for the Ultra Boost Uncaged 3.0. Unfortunately the sizing is off on this one - you'll need to size up a half size or even possibly a full size (especially if you have wide feet). I normally wear size 8, but ordered a 9 just in case, and I am glad I did as I don't think even the 8.5 would've been comfortable. If you can, try before you buy.",88016018
CDI86,2,06/07/2017,"Too tight I stayed true to my size, but these are too tight. I have the black uncage ltd ultra boost and they are fine. I guess i should have sized up. They look great but, wished they felt as great.",87969970

CDI86,4,06/03/2017,Really good shoe Great shoe and great colour scheme. Size 9 feels slightly narrow compared to a size 8.5 of the brown uncaged but not uncomfortable,87689851
CDI86,5,06/03/2017," Adidas Ultra Boost it's where I stopped in searching the perfect shoes for my runs even though they might not be comfortable for few times ( as it was for me with my first ultra boost pair ) until your feet will get used with these tight fit like a sock kinda shoes. I selected comfort Ok because they're perfect for your runs but if you'll buy'em thinking they'll be awesome for your daily casual day by day wear you'll be wrong and I would sugest to go for Adidas Pure Boost in that case since they're more loose and therefore more comfortable for big amount of time wear.
I hope my review will be helpful for y'all ADIDAS fans like me out there & happy runnings. ;)",87685016

CDI86,5,05/23/2017, i would love to buy black color shoe in this model,86865185
CDI86,5,05/23/2017,"Good deal The pair are really comfortable and soft, would recommend them",86863419
CDI86,4,05/22/2017,"Interesting, but complicated to find best fit Impractical but looks good.  It's also less stretchy/flexible than its non-parley counterparts.  
***It also runs half a size smaller.

I ended up returning mine, but in large part because I did not read that they ran extr small.  Needless to say I was rushing to buy them even though these didn't sell out as fast as the UB Parley.",86862831
CDI86,5,05/22/2017,"Enjoying every moment wearing it Feels like walking on cloud, very soft and light on feet",86862284
CDI86,4,05/22/2017,"Good but too snug The shoes are super comfy but they fit too small, I needed to go a full size up, still a really good shoe tho",86861051
CDI86,1,05/22/2017,"I wouldn't recommend these as a day to day pair of shoes, it's not at all breathable so they make your feet sweat constantly The design is way too narrow if you have normal feet",86860153
CDI86,5,05/22/2017, great product and great concept it just runs a little small.,86852319
CDI86,5,05/22/2017,Favorite new everyday shoe! The comfort is on point and has a cool concept behind it! Amazing shoe and colors!,86848080
CDI86,4,05/22/2017,My feet are thanking you!!! Awesome shoe!! These shoes are awesome!! I wish all my shoes came with boost bottoms. Only issuethe uncaged is difficult to put on.,86843994

CDI86,4,05/22/2017,Ultra boosts are very comfortable but overpriced. Over priced and no free shipping even when over $200.,86843565
CDI86,4,05/22/2017, It feels uncomfortable on the top part of the feet and hurts a bit when you walk.,86843345
CDI86,1,05/22/2017,"Great idea but they have to be more consistent in production. It wasn't anything like my other uncaged Ultraboost. The toe bent up way too much and I had to force my foot in, I returned the shoe even though I've been wanting it forever!",86842797
CDI86,2,05/22/2017, The parley uncaged did not fit the same as the regular uncaged in the same size. Not as soft either...very disappointed,86841349
CDI86,5,05/22/2017,The concept is awesome! It fit like a glove. I have narrow feet and I love the fit! ... The only thing is the arch. I have to use my own inserts.,86840010

CDI86,5,05/21/2017,One of the most comfortable sneakers on the planet! This sneaker is both comfortable and stylish. I definitely recommend it.,86831448
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,"Great addition to the collection Parley for the win, the shoe is very comfortable as any ultraboost. The concept behind the shoe is awesome, my only complaint is that they fit smaller than ultraboost 3.0, more like 2.0, so I had to take the insole out otherwise was to snug for me. Adidas I love  you but get your sizing right for once!!!",86831359
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,"Great shoe and great cause. Very comfortable, excellent colorway, first pair of uncaged and I am very happy.",86831141

CDI86,5,05/21/2017, I like how each pair is approximately 11 bottles of plastic removed from the ocean.,86830803
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,"I would recommend, thump up! the softness and the style are amazing. They 've brought ultraboost to the next level being the best running shoes ever.",86830290
CDI86,5,05/21/2017, Awesome shoe. Looks and feels great! the shoe feels like a sock and is as light as a feather,86830217
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,I don't think I can wear any other shoes after these. I love ❤️ the style and comfort they provide. I'll choose this style over any other.,86829510
CDI86,4,05/21/2017," Great looking shoe but even if it runs small, it looks big on feet",86829154
CDI86,5,05/21/2017, I have a pair of NMD's and these felt almost the same even better.,86765244
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,First pair of uncaged and I'm not disappointed I wish the bottom sole was black just for the new look.,86749562
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,"One of my favorite purchases of the year so far! The Uncaged Parley UltraBoost is without a doubt a slept on shoe, it is beautiful in design and as always with UltraBoost models extremely comfortable! If your size is still available I would definitely cop!",86733298
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,"Best Recycled Shoe Little tighter than regular ultra boost, I'm sure it will break in.",86726741
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,"Comfy shoe, looks nice, too small The Boost sole is great and comfy, however I hate the practice of shoes that run small (which this shoe does). If it's known that a shoe is a half-size (or any size for that matter) small, the sizes for the shoe should be shifted instead of putting the burden on the consumer to get the right size.",86726189
CDI86,3,05/21/2017,"Try on a bigger size! The shoe feels a little too tight, and didn't quite look like the photo",86726048
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,Good experience and i am satisfied with my purchase. For my 1st lair of uncaged the shoe kinda digs into the back of my ankle but i think once it loosens up it should fit fine. Appearance and for the most part it is comfortable.,86725462
CDI86,4,05/21/2017, color of the shoe and cause is important.  Shoe was too small and needed to go up a full size,86725046
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,Shoe is aesthetically pleasing and extremely comfortably Adidas Ultra boosts represents Quality and comfort,86725031
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,"Outstanding, just a real tight fit. I would definitely recommend this shoe. Besides running small, they're outstanding.",86724954
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,Need a half size larger than normal uncaged. These are tighter than same size ultraboost uncaged.,86724929
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,Most comfortable shoes I've had in a while These shoes are great. Really comfortable and well worth the price,86724737
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,There just a little to much for a pair of shoes There great shoes just think that the other colors are better looking and cheaper,86724503
CDI86,4,05/21/2017,Fine They run a size small but are super nice. Wish I ordered bigger,86724458
CDI86,1,05/21/2017,"Not happy great looking shoes, but as a person who has worn Adidas his entire life, i am very dissapointed with this product. I ordered the right size but after wearing it once my ankle is swollen. I tried removing the soles but it didn't work either. They are extremely tight and uncomfortable. I cannot return it since I threw the box away, cause I though it's adidas and I will never have any problems with it.",86722001
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,such a flex great pair of trainers that would be great for summer,86720233
CDI86,5,05/21/2017,Boost is life Comfortable. Should give it a try. Will not regret it for sure.,86719757
CDI86,3,05/20/2017,I love boost but this one didn't work out well for me I am a woman and I bought men's size 6. Very comfortable but the ankle was way too tight . It cut of the circulation.,86712192
CDI86,5,05/20/2017,"Awesome! Fits well and very comfortable

CDI86,4,05/20/2017,"A little too tight for my wide feet. These look so clean, but I went with half a size up and they still squeeze my toes a lot. Not sure if this is something I can get used to, should've gone a whole size up.",86671509
CDI86,2,05/20/2017,"run very small I really loved these shoes until I tried to put them on, I ordered my normal ultra boost size which all fit perfectly but these were very small and tight I even tried them without the insole but they were still too small, I would like to return for a bigger size but they are all sold out.",86671431
CDI86,5,05/20/2017,Very happy with them This shoe is really comfortable as are all of the Ultraboost Uncaged. Very nice colour and clean design.,86668798

CDI86,5,05/19/2017,Excellent Always like the ultra boost as they are the most comfortable trainers out there,86643138
CDI86,1,05/19/2017,Too Snug I have over 20 pairs of Ultra Boost in both caged and uncaged. This round of Parley's are uncomfortably tight. I had to return the caged and uncaged I secured on release day. Very disappointed that I was hyped on this project and the shoes are nothing like my other 3.0's or Uncaged's. Can Adidas confirm the disconnect in this model? Will they stretch out or is it because of the recycled ocean plastics the fit is different?,86643085
CDI86,5,05/19/2017,Worth the price tag. Most comfortable shoes in my collection because of the ultraboost technology.Always a big fan of the boost. Recommend to go 0.5 size up.,86641971
CDI86,5,05/19/2017,"So comfy The parley edition, food to see use of plastic found in ocean",86641543
CDI86,4,05/19/2017,"Great initiative, great (lifestyle) shoe! This was my first experience with Ultra Boosts, and after having read countless reviews, I have to say they were a little less comfortable than I imagined (probably due to ridiculously high expectations I had) but still very comfortable nonetheless. I am still suffering from a chronic knee injury which has prevented me from running for a long time, and I was hoping these would be the shoes that I would use to slowly ease back in. I think the uncaged style makes them more of a lifestyle shoe than a running shoe, and my toes feel like they might pop out from the front.
The sizing is definitely off - I wear a UK5.5 for Stan Smiths and they fit perfectly. I went a half-size up and they are quite tight, but I'm sure they will stretch out a little after a couple of wears. I also have a relatively high arc which makes these shoes a little difficult to put on, even with the laces loose.
I do, however, LOVE the initiative behind these shoes - I think Adidas should definitely produce more sustainable products and make them the norm, rather than special releases.",86641295
CDI86,5,05/19/2017,Clean shoe great design and concept Great shoe would recommend going up half a size in this,86640050
CDI86,4,05/19/2017,They are a little more snug than primeknit uppers. Design I feel is better. They look good on the feet. Very comfortable to run in.,86639865
CDI86,5,05/19/2017,Probably one of the best looking Ultra Boost in my opinion. The shoe looks even better in person. Really good build quality and design,86639782
CDI86,5,05/19/2017,"Great shoes but needed to be 1/2 size larger. Fit is smaller/narrower than my other uncaged shoes; however, I am still happy with the shoes.",86639517

CDI86,5,05/18/2017,The nicest version of uncaged ever! Where do I even start? Collab between Adidas and Parley is probably one of the most attractive designs I came across with boost shoes. Fantastic looking knitwear and so comfortable!,86610436
CDI86,5,05/18/2017,"Great comfortable shoe These shoes are great, really comfortable and look brillant",86610292
CDI86,5,05/18/2017,Blown away. First pair of any Adidas in a very long time. These are the single most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet. Not to mention they look incredible and are made sustainably while cleaning our oceans. Love every single thing about these.,86604909
CDI86,2,05/17/2017,"Parley colorway is way too tight on bridge of foot—much worse than previous iterations of Uncaged. Quality shoes, but holy smokes they're uncomfortable. The Parley Uncaged is super, super tight on the bridge of the foot. So tight that it cut of both my circulation and my brother's. Length and width are perfect so I don't think moving up a size would be advisable. The other Uncaged I have worn aren't a problem, but the Parley colorway is super uncomfortable. Go caged or if you want Uncaged, go with another colorway.",86563173
CDI86,3,05/17/2017,"Awesome cause. disappointing sizing. I was incredibly excited to find that my shoes had arrived. But, turns out they are TOO TIGHT. I am size 12 in Ultraboost so i figured ordering half a size bigger would differentiate this particular shoe's size. Disappointed.",86563128
CDI86,1,05/15/2017," The Parley shoes are too TIGHT. I have the same size of UltraBOOST Uncaged Shoes, which are so perfect and comfortable. They shouldn't have this kind of difference, right?",86514300
CDI86,2,05/15/2017,Disappointed with my purchase! Just received my new Adidas in the mail.  Was super excited until I tried them on and noticed the middle of the inner sole was not properly glued in and created this uncomfortable slack/bump which I felt when walking.  Disappointed with the poor build quality.  Will return for a refund.,86511733

CDI86,1,05/13/2017,"Make More Ultra Boost & Less Uncaged!! Make More Regular Ultra Boost!!! I love Adidas and Ultra Boost, but you are missing the mark on the product demand. The regular Ultra Boost is preferred by customers who buy them for running, but you can NEVER find them. Case and point Parley Ultra Boost sold out in 10 minutes and you can still get Uncaged Ultra Boost 3 days later. It is extremely frustrating. If you start shopping when you have 200 miles on your shoes, it is doubtful that you will find a pair before you break 300 miles. Uncaged run too small and are not nearly as good for running! Listen to your customer demand. Shift supply from Uncaged to Regular Ultra Boost",86437263
CDI86,5,05/12/2017,"Amazing shoe. Great collab As my first experience with and Ultra Boost model i have to say I am beyond impressed. Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.

- 3 holes in the Boost material (2 are pictured)
- 2 stains in the Primeknit material (1 is pictured)
- 2 areas with loose thread (1 is pictured)
- 1 area with uneven stitching (pictured)
- Scratched box (pictured)

DWH89,4,09/14/2017,"welcome to the future This unique version of ""Night Cargo"" is dark olive interlaced with a shade of flesh (from a distance, this colorway gives the illusion of brown).  Combined with a black midsole, it's a conservative looking running shoe that's attractive with almost any clothing and works in almost any athletic or social situation.  However, there's a couple of spots of white stitching on this colorway that stick out like a sore thumb...making it look like I repaired a tear with dental floss!  

There's no insole included...which wouldn't be an issue if there was more arch support.  There is some light arch support designed into the shoe's frame, but it's not quite satisfactory even for my medium arches.  The included extra laces are unnecessary garbage and, imo, should be replaced with optional medium-arched insoles.

The polyester knit upper is more breathable than most shoes, but still a little humid in summer.  However, I actually prefer this basic knit because it's more supportive than ""primeknit"".  Increasing this support is pureBoost's lacing system (which includes internal/hidden mid-foot straps)...when laced snug, it just feels much more ""locked in"" than even the more high-end Boost models.

I had reservations about the ""burrito"" tongue.  It can bunch up when putting on the shoe, but, once straightened out (easy), it feels completely un-noticeable.   This version of burrito tongue is different/better than burrito tongues on other brands...I think it's actually better than even the old standard-type tongues.

There's no padding on the ankle collar, which might matter if you run a lot.  The heel-cup is excellent...but, if you don't lace snugly, you might get slight ""heel lift"".

Boost is among the best sole cushioning I've ever felt in a running shoe (and I've tried most of the ""maximalist"" brands).",93263516

If you have a narrow foot, this would not be the right shoe for you.  My foot is in-between normal and wide and it feels like I have lots of room for my toes, more than it would in a ladies shoe.

DWH89,3,07/19/2017,"Great looking shoe, be wary of injury The shoe looks great, although after my first run in these the black boost got caked with a layer of dirt, so I had to wash that off, and that took extra time which I should have seen coming. After my second run, I was walking home when the outside tendon below my right ankle began to hurt a lot, and it sidelined me for about a week. I believe that it was due to the fact that the collar digs into your foot on the outside in general, but it especially does so on turns. In general I wouldn't recommend the shoe for running, especially for the price.",90628864

DWH89,3,06/23/2017,I like adidas shoes but the prices are a bit much. Not sure I got what I paid for with these. Definitely not worth 170. I've wearing some form of the boost shoes for the past three running shoes I've Owned.  Been eyeing the ultra boost forever but couldn't pull the trigger cause of the price. Liked these cause of the black sole. Figured I would suck it up and drop the extra cash. Not worth the extra money in my opinion. Maybe the ultra boost shoes are much better but to me there isn't much difference between this and other cheaper boost shoes I had in past. Hope it helps someone save a couple bucks.,89096134

If you have really wide feet, you might want to go half a size up. The knit material is comfortable, and the boost is great. The grip is definitely noticeable, especially on concrete. The only thing that you might have issues with is the lack of a solid cage for additional support - however, it is snug enough to make less of an issue.

Whenever I walk, if feels like I’m walking on a soft cloud! It doesn’t even bounce, and that’s amazing.

Now imagine sliding one of those beds on each foot and walking around for the day. Sound good?
WARNING: If you try this you may never want to wear another shoe again!
 But the ultimate bonus with this model is that the entire primeknit toebox is water repellent. So its the best ultraboost for rainy/snowy weather.

DWG38,5,10/18/2017,"An upgrade from the 3.0's About a year ago I bought my first pair of Ultraboost, the regular grey 3.0's. They looked nice and were very comfortable, they were my go to sneaker. I wore them so much that they are extremely beat up. The boost is no longer white, the sole is falling off, there are scuffs everywhere. So when I heard about a more durable Ultraboost, that was a mid, I knew I had to buy them. I have had them for about two weeks now and they fix a lot of the issues the old Ultraboost had. The heel is far more secure. You can wear them lose and do sports because the mid heel. They have inside padding making them far more comfortable. The sole is more grippy and seems to be higher quality. The cage is gone so you won't get scratches and the thing that says Ultraboost at the back of the shoe is made of a more scratch resistant materiel. They have a coating above the flyknit meaning that they scuff less esisly and water rolls off. They look nicer aswell. Really worth the money.",94467067

DWG38,5,10/14/2017,"Well Rounded attractive shoe These sneakers have a lot of strengths and it's hard to pick one favorite aspect. I like the mid sock upper, it's A bit unique. The boost is as good as I've heard from Friends and co-workers. (Not a runner but I have sprinted in these trying to catch a bus and I was surprised at the impact protection and comfort in the the forefoot. I've been caught in rain and had puddles splashed on them with little soakage (?). The extra rubber gives me confidence in using these every day. I feel like these are also a fine fall shoe (good timing) and I especially like the fact that the primeknit is warm when it's cold and that a strong breeze can cool your feet after a day at work.",94332786

Unfortunately, if you are planning any athletic activities these are not the shoes for you. If you are interested in over paying for ""all terrain"" shoes so you can ultra bounce around town in jeans and tell your friends you paid $220 for a glorified pair of house-slippers you should buy these.

I bought them a week ago and just ran 5 miles on the beach. What a horrible experience, they were soft and comfortable on my 20 yard walk to the beach. Thats where the fun stops, after that I was not sure I could finish. The lateral support in the toe box is so bad that in both directions ( running out and back ) both my left foot and my right foot were rolling over the edge of the shoe. I honestly thought the material would tear out on my first run.

DWG38,5,10/05/2017,"Premium I ordered and recently received the core black and burgundy Ultra Boost ATRs. First impression out of the box was it looks and feels premium. As for me, it does not feel tight or snug and feels similar to the regular 3.0. I even compared it to a 3.0 by wearing each on each foot. I was even surprised that the ATR's felt more comfortable on my heels only to find out that there is more foam like padding inside around the heel cup. In terms of tightness around the midfoot area, they felt very similar to loosely tied 3.0. To top things off, the outsole seems to be three times as thick. I have unworn 3.0 three grey's that looked like it had a bald or worn out outsold compared to these. I will attach pictures to show you what I mean. Overall happy with these shoes and well worth the price considering the very thick outsoles that will last a very long time.",93938593

I had some doubts before ordering this shoe as I was worried that the water resistant film would make the Primeknit less soft and it doesn't have a traditional exterior cage. Worry no more. The primeknit is still soft and incredibly comfortable. Where you would normally find the cage of a regular UltraBoost there is integrated support within the 3 stripes, which helps keep the upper snug to your foot. The mid collar is very stretchy and doesn't hinder your ability to slip the shoes on. The continental sole seems about twice as thick as a traditional UltraBoost shoe.",93739951

I think the issue with the sizing most people have can be solved by purchasing higher-end lightweight socks. I first used my standard sneaker socks, and indeed the Adios was too tight. But, then I figured I could upgrade my socks, and problem solved. Maybe that's what Adidas was thinking?",97755040

Looks wise, they have a retro feel with some modern technologies mixed in, giving the shoe a sleek appearance. Fit wise, go true to size or half size up since the toe-box is a bit snug. The durability on the Adios 3 is pretty decent, the upper is made from a mesh and suede construction, keeping your foot locked down during runs. The Boost midsole makes each step feel energized and the cushioning doesn't deteriorate that much over time. Overall, this is a great shoe for training and races!",97727386
KEK81,5,12/02/2017,"My Go-To Race Day Shoe I was introduced to this model a little more than a year ago by my local running store, and it's been a revelation and game changer for me. The shoe is light, fast, responsive and comfortable enough because of the Boost material to be a Race Day shoe for 5k to road marathons. I've PR'd in all the distances in the past year in no small part because of this shoe. I have so much confidence in the fit, grip and ride of this shoe that I don't even have to think about whether to buy more. I can't think of a more perfect racing shoe.  

At the recommendation of my LRS I sized up about a half size, and it gives my forefoot just enough extra room for the splay and slight swelling that occurs over a marathon distance. 

The only regret that I have about this shoe is that the outsole tends to wear through to the torsion plate at less than 300 miles for me. I know this is because of my slightly supinating footstrike, and I don't fault the design of the shoe and its choice of materials.",97711451

They're like the best of both worlds",97187269

KEK81,3,11/02/2017,"These run small, order half a size up The shoes feel fast, and I like that they're lightweight and have the mesh upper that allows breathability. However it took a while to find the right fit since I have wider feet and these run narrow - I'd suggest ordering half a size up. 

Unfortunately the mesh material is not very durable - after just a month in these shoes the mesh upper started to tear near the right pinky toe, and every time I wear these shoes the hole gets visibly bigger. I'm doing marathon training at about 50+ miles per week (though I wear different shoes if I'm doing a slow easy run, so they don't take all my mileage), so I know that puts a lot of wear and tear on them. However, my first pair of Adios's had no issues as to the material durability, so I may have just received a defective product. It hasn't even been 2 months yet and now the fabric tear is at least 1.5 inches long. Unfortunately I'm 1 month away from our race, and it's probably too late to switch to a new shoe model, so I'm hoping my next pair that I just ordered actually holds up this time.",96237337

KEK81,5,10/19/2017,"Excellent purchase. I ordered a pair through Amazon and they recommended half a size larger. Good thing they did because they fit perfectly. I also ordered through Amazon because they had a version that was $40 less due to the color which is so horrible (Solar Red?!). Luckily, I don't mind the color for running shoes. Then Adidas lowered the price on the light blue ones and since I love the fit, I bought a pair of those. The colors I actually like (the black ones or white ones) are too expensive. But the shoes are incredible. They're light, sleek, breathable. I don't know how long I will be able to run with them, I run around 15 miles per week, but I have the purchase date and so when they're worn out I'll see. Good thing is I only use them for running because of the flamboyant color (I run very early in the morning). It's a shame because they are just so pretty. I would love to wear them with jeans but I don't want the shoes to attract the attention of helicopters flying overhead.",94512665

Although my feet are very standard and I always wear size 42, I got these shoes in size 42 1/3 this time and they still turned out to be too small and too tight for me. Besides that the strips of artificial suede on the nose and sides of the shoes will get soiled very quickly and so will the white foam soles. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase, except for the wrong size.",94312548

KEK81,2,09/19/2017,"A shoe that didn't last When I first bought this shoe, either it came laced or I laced it too tight. My feet would hurt after light runs or walks. I slowly kept loosening the laces all the way to the bottom and I finally found a really comfortable shoe.

I've owned these shoes for 6 months, and I would describe them as EXTREMELY worn. My dog ate my last running shoes (thanks Ada) and I started wearing these on walks about 3 months ago. The Continental sole was a selling point to me because I really enjoy their bicycle/car tires, but now I don't think they last. I don't have data to back this up, but I would break down my 6 months as such:

Month 1: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 2: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 3: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bunch)
Month 4: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bit more)
Month 5: 130 miles walking on pavement, 20 miles running on pavement, 15 miles on dirt paths (dog ate other shoes, these are all I've got)
Month 6: 110 miles walking on pavement, 10 miles running on pavement, 30 miles on dirt paths (something feels off)
DONEZO!

I'm disappointed with this shoe. I was hoping for them to last at least a quarter of the time of my Nike Free running shoes, but they just didn't hold up. It's ok if they were meant for short distance grip, I just expected a bit more longevity.",93350019

KEK81,4,09/10/2017,"Excelent trainers, but be careful with size These are excellent trainers. They're light, airy and they look fantastic compared to the garish coloured running trainers from other manufacturers. I've run over 300km in them so far (with individual runs over 30km) and I haven't received a blister yet. However, be very careful with the size. I'm consistently size 10, as measured in many shoe shops and running specialists, however I had to return my original size 10 orders and re-order a size 11. Note that I couldn't find a single high street stockist after searching four towns, so I couldn't try any on before buying.

There is also a minor quality issue (but one I wouldn't have expected given the high price). The lace retaining loops on the tongues are in completely different places on each shoe. This is shown in the attached photograph. On the right shoe the loop is between the third and fourth eyelets, and on the left shoe it's between the fourth and fifth.

Furthermore, there were no care instructions included with the trainers. I expected some to be provided.

Overall I would highly recommend these trainers, but if you can try some on and inspect the quality before buying, do so.",93115607

They are incredibly comfortable and light. I ran 20 miles with them the first day and had no soreness or fatigue - just an amazing shoe!

I see now why these are used by so many for marathon races and I will happily be sporting these for my next race coming up. Thanks, Adidas!

Have tried my best to buy another pair of these- can't find them anywhere- you need to go up a full size, but they are comfortable once you finally find a pair that fits- I'm not sure why Adidas would make a great shoe- and then make them so hard to find.

KEK81,4,06/05/2017,Very good shoe. Very good for speed work. Always get adidas. Only issue is the sole wears out on the outside a bit too quickly which shortens the life of the trainers when the rest of the shoe is in perfect working order. If it weren't for this seemingly planned obsolescence that is apparent in most lightweight racing trainers I would score it 5.,87790396

KEK81,5,05/21/2017,"Size Up Just like my Energy Boost & Ultra, the sizing runs slightly small and have therefore gone half a size up.
In terms of comfort, they're not as cushioned as the other two Boost models yet as these are more for speed workouts they provide a more firmer ride.
My advice is to try before you buy as wearing the wrong size footwear will ruin your run both mentally and physically.

KEK81,4,05/16/2017,"Really good looking kicks with a throwback to the 80s! These trainers remind me of the old Adidas kicks that Starsky used to wear with the gum soles. Granted, they are very different, but some of the design aspects especially in the front are similar. Love these shoes.  Will say that there is far less room in the toe box than other Adidas size 12 shoes, but are so light and have lots of ventilation and flex that they are very comfortable. Good for running as there is less foot slide.  The ultra boost material is great in the heel, but slightly thin on the sole, but still very comfortable even with my psoriatic arthritis. 

Love the colour and the design and they look the biz!",86532000

They are versatile in a way that they can be used for a wide array of race distances from 3k to marathon distance. My main concern with the shoe is the longevity of the sole. The continental sole wears out far too quickly. This is the reason 5 stars were not awarded!! Definitely needs looked at Adidas!",86527769

KEK81,3,05/05/2017,Comfortable BUT..... I had to go up into men's sizes as the women's ones are too small for me. They are fantastically comfortable shoes which I have been wearing in the gym for general training BUT they have worn out really quickly. The soles on both have split where the plastic arch stiffener embedded in the sole ends. This is a great shame as I loved the shoes and would make me very hesitant to buy another pair. I have never known any other trainers to fail in this way.,86129433

KEK81,2,04/29/2017,"Long time buyers beware of major size changes. I've long been an adidas fan two two reasons: 1. they fit, and 2.the simple white & black schemes. About 4 years ago, they appear to have sized down ALL of their forms (all least in the soccer and running lines). So if you had a comfy pair you bought 5 years ago, GO AT LEAST A HALF SIZE UP. Also, if you don't want obnoxious colors, you'll have to go with the customized version, which, at considerable cost, will allow you to get rid of the obnoxiously bright colors.

Depending on the model, I am usually a 9.5 or 10. I ordered a 10 however they felt big, so I ordered a 9.5 and they felt too tight. In short they felt uncomfortable. I also found them to be somewhat stiff for a performance running shoe.",82351027

First of all, it’s hard to get the tightness of the shoe just right. I’ve had to readjust multiple times to get the perfect fit. Where the plastic stripes are on the side, can feel a bit tight. Also, the flimsy laces slap my shoes for the entire run.

No other online retailers had the discount (like Zappos, where I wouldn't be waiting 5 business days each time I have to order another size). Do appreciate that Adidas has free return shipping.

I am incredibly hard on my running shoes, so when I wore out the originals I tried the 2's - and they were so uncomfortable! Adidas had completely changed the proportions, so my high arched, narrow feet no longer felt supported. Anyway, I tried several different styles and ultimately went to another brand. 
When the Energy Boost 3's came out I was really excited and I decided to give them another shot... Now not only are they even wider than the 2's, but the sizing is COMPLETELY off. I have worn a 7.5 in Adidas for the last 15 years and these 7.5 Energy Boosts were a half size too big! I thought about exchanging them for a smaller size, but I don't even know if it's worth the aggravation.

Boost always feels good, but I must say it's the upper on this shoe that steals the show in terms of comfort. The flap on the outsole near the heel is very helpful for keeping them clean.

The combination of the boost foam and a hard rubber outsole hold up very nicely.  I have a close to 2 hundred miles on them and they still feel fresh and new.  On the sizing I think they run a bit long and narrow.  I have relatively long and narrow low volume feet so it works well for me.

As light as a tempo shoe but with 3x's the comfort and cushioning. My injury rates have gone way down since I started wearing the Adidas Energy Boost about 5 years ago.

I use them on roads and trails and on park runs. Cushion with speed and feel !,93292739

For my feet, these are a perfect fit. I personally like the fit like a sock feel ... less slipping, minimal to no blisters, and since I'm a habitual heel striker - the feel of my foot hitting the pavement is minimal which decreases my foot pain after a long run. The only knock I've had is the the wear on the sole is quick ... though with this latest pair, I see they've stepped up the game in that area with the improved Continental rubber. We shall see, but so far, so good ... as usual.",92759237

This new model is simply not as good as expected  according to advertisement. For a forefoot runner as I, the shoes cushioning were simply too soft making it feel like running in the sand. The boost, energy or extra kick they advertise about were simply not there. suddenly i ran 10 seconds slower per kilometer with these shoes. I wont recommend these shoes to anything else than recovery runs or fashion. P.s. the forefoot are a bit too wide which forced me to buy half a size smaller than energy boost 3.

DWH11,2,12/15/2017,"Runs much bigger than the Supernova Glide Boost! I usually wore a size 9.5 in the Supernova Glide Boost- which was a great style- that had a very stretchy fabric upper material that made them my go-to sneaker, so I bought multiple pairs. I wear insoles in my shoes which push my foot upwards- so I really need the top to be made of a stretchy flexible material. I really wanted to love these shoes- because not only do they have Boost- but they also have stability, which is really key for me. I also love the all black colorway that I ordered in a size 9.5, so style wise they look great. They seem like they are great quality, but they are easily an entire size too large for me, so I will have to send them back. Also the fact that the upper front material has changed really ruins this style for me. If they make these with Primeknit or the same material that the Glide Boosts were made of on top- they would be perfect.",98148575

Heel counter grips my foot nicely and there is a pronounced forefoot rocker to aid during toe-off. The liner of this Reigning Champ version is leather lined so it feels really nice.

CDM88,5,11/06/2017,"Impressed so far. I don't use these for running, but I work on my feet walking around for 9 hours a day and these are great.
A bit more narrow feeling than my Ultraboosts, and the mesh is definitely more snug, and not as stretchy as the primeknit, but It still feels great.
The name is perfect as the midsoul is more firm, but gives you this bounce feeling that sort of propels you forward.

I do not suggest using these shoes at the gym, as the tread change on the makes  for an unbalanced shoe. You will notice this as soon as you put them on. They seem OK for running...  but I have not tried this as this is mostly an athleisure shoe.",86650496
CDM88,4,05/13/2017, Shoe runs half size larger. Overall decent quality,86449553
CDM88,5,05/01/2017," - 0.5 size down at least, they are long in fit and appearance. They feel snug width wise for me, but it breaks in. 

- Wasn't sure how gray they were, it's a very light gray. I consider them more off white than gray.

- They WILL develop creases across the toe box. Most shoes do, but these will be slightly more noticeable though.

- Feels average in weight and breathability. They are not as light as primeknit etc. 

- Quality of construction is better than average, and on the higher tier of adidas shoes.

- Walking and running it feels very good!

Mine came with the left shoe having a orange glue stain which is hard to remove. Also it seemed tried on where certain parts had creasing and felt worn.

Otherwise, great looking shoes. I prefer ultraboost over these, but for the value it's great.",85948293

The upper creases near the toe box after about 10-15 wears, but it isn't PK so what more can you ask for? Bounce cushioning is far superior to boost in terms of long term comfort or all day wear. If you are a hypebeast who works on your feet, you just found your ideal everyday shoe. Looks amazing with jeans and sweats and performs at the level of a high end performance shoe.

EFT54,1,09/27/2017,"Very poor quality! I am a HUGE Ultra Boost shoes fan. I’ve never had anything negative to say – they’re beautiful, comfortable and great quality (at least I thought so). I’ve purchased 4 different colors/versions over the past two years but I’ve never purchased a Parley shoe until now. It’s VERY evident that Adidas sacrificed quality for looks on these. Within just a few wears, the heel/back of my shoes were completed RIPPED. I’ve never had this issue with the regular Ultra Boosts… The inner lining is made out of a different material on the Parley models, which feels weaker and much thinner than the regular models. Now I can’t even wear my Parleys because all they do is give me blisters… 
If you love shoes that you can actually wear more than 10 times, stay away from these…",93652809

The boost at the front of the shoe should be thicker and should not rise upwards by 45 degrees it should be flat on the ground at 0-5 degrees as this is a big problem for anyone who isn't flat footed or people with big feet, however the shoe is great, parley recycled everything which is impressive and the colours work very well together, all that's needed is more work on the boost sole and possibly a back heel tab.",90631899

Very streamlined and even caught my own attention in the mirrors at the gym.  I will say that the first day I wore these, they hurt in both the pressure of the ""insert"" and the elastic around the ankle of the upper.  By the second day, my foot had worked in the insert and it felt really good. Not hard but also not too soft which was causing problems for my feet in another pair of shoes. The elastic still hurts a bit and I have to pull up my socks or my the cuffs of my pants down so my achilles isn't rubbed raw. I expect that need to go away soon though.

We don't want to wear only loud pink and purple stereotypical colors! These are great to wear to work or just to walk all over NYC with amazing comfort. I can fit my arch support inserts in these no problem. I just wish they had more color options for women. Amazingly comfortable and my foot does not slide all over the place.

BEZ74,4,07/23/2017,"A very good shoe for anyone wanting a light cushioned ride I am 6'5"" , 225, and nobody has ever called me el gato. I have no mechanical issues w my feet or stride . All I have ever wanted in a shoe was the equivalent of two pillows to bolt on my feet. Historically though, my heal strike would go right through the cushion of a soft shoe which was harder on my body than the harder mid soles. These are by far the softest shoe I have used that I don't crash through the padding. I am only running on dirt and caliche so cannot rate them on pavement. They are replacing my older ultra boost. They are softer than the old shoe but the fact that the old shoes held up so well encourages me as to if they will last.

As w all of the ultra boost I have owned, they will suck the sock off your foot if the sock is any thing but a tight fit because the heel fits loose",90945838

They look pretty terrible if you don't have long pants on due to the cuff squeezing your ankle. They're pretty comfortable, I expected more from the boost but they're good for running in straight lines. If you're wanting to do something turn-intensive (e.g. basketball,) think again. These shoes have no horizontal support and, when quickly turning, the sole will slip out from under your foot due to the stretchy primeknit on the side. The boost wears pretty easily and looks kinda nasty, but other than that, they've held up pretty well. No frays or anything on the primeknit, which is nice.",93326447

FBN57,5,07/10/2017,"Wow. Amazing shoe and worth the price This is a review of the adidas Ultra boost uncaged 2.0.

The primary difference between the uncaged 1.0 and 2.0 is the 3D-printed heel cup and the introduction of some fresh new colorways.

I went to the adidas Employee Store in Portland and they (unfortunately) didn't have any ultraboost uncaged shoes in my size. I was able to purchase the last pair (size 9) at a footlocker.

In terms of fit, I'd go true-to-size. If you aren't too fond of a snug fit, going a half-size up is an option. You can really feel the boost in every step you take and the continental rubber tread has durability that is comparable to that of an overbaked cookie - no matter what you do to it, it just won't break.

In-person, the primeknit of the core black/grey colorway looks like a slightly darker version of the NMD_R1 Firestarter's primeknit. The laces look as if there was a tinge of purple applied to them as they are not the same shade as the primeknit upper.

Other than that, the Ultra boost uncaged 2.0 is a really nice shoe that I would most definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a lifestyle shoe that can also be used for athletics.

Great job adidas and keep the amazing products coming :)",89988331

FBL99,5,12/14/2017,"RUNS VERY LARGE! BUT WORTH IT. I was looking for a new running shoe - and didn't want to (although I should have) make the trek to an store. There is only an Adidas Outlet near me, and by ""near me"" it's still almost an hour away.

I was contemplating between the Boost soles and these Alphabounce soles. I will admit that me choosing the Alphabounce over the Boost was a price point reasoning. 

The shoe is a bit heavier than say ... a Free Run and the shoe is not nearly as ... bendable? Like I can't grab the shoe with my hands and bend the toe up to the heel - but obviously, that's because the sole is a bit sturdier (needed for long runs). The shoe itself is amazing. It's responsive. They're comfortable and they feel great.

I am normally a 6 but in running shoes I tend to go 6.5-7 depending. I originally ordered a 6.5 (first photo) but they were WAY too big. Like so big, I thought they sent me a mans shoe. I returned it, and then reordered the shoe (and I was soooooo unsure at this point what size was going to be correct since it was really THAT large) and got a 5.5.

The 5.5 fit great - but I can't wear thicker socks with them. I think if I went with a 6 I'd probably have to wear REALLY thick socks.

Overall I think they're a great shoe - but they run LARGE.",98137666

FBL99,2,11/28/2017,Fits well BUT not breathable I like the fit and comfort BUT these shoes are not breathable. My feet were sweating in just a few hours wearing these for walking.

These shoes are light and feel like your not wearing anything. They hug your feet but not so tight they’re uncomfortable. You get great support and they are so comfortable! I have foot issues and other brands would start to hurt after wearing them for a few hours. These don’t do that. Needless to say, my others got chucked in the trash after I put these on.

KDO46,3,11/29/2017,"Honestly could have been better. The good side to this shoe is that it’s very light weight so it doesn’t get too uncomfortable. The reason why I reated this a 3 is because the botoms of the shoe are not very flexible. Because of that, once your foot hits the ground, its more like a thump. Everytime I go jogging whether its on the tredmill of outside, its just *thump thump thump*. They’re also very flat. I could wear these shoes like trainers. Running shoes are suppose to make you feel like you don’t have shoes on. This shoe makes sure you do.",97631657
KDO46,5,11/29/2017,"Worst Running shoe I put 5 stars so everyone can read. This is not a great shoe for a serious runner. The sock design seems cool, but if you run hard the laces will dig in to the top of your foot. If you had to buy them they would only be cool looking shoes that you can wear for light walking. They don't even have the support in the top to be a training shoe. Not for any serious workouts.",97591569

However at the bridge of my feet it is on the tighter side so it hurts a bit when I leave my feet in for too long. I have a higher foot arch so that may be why. I got the black ones and they look fantastic.",97581651
KDO46,5,11/22/2017,"Obsessed with these shoes!! I am so in love with these shoes!! They are beyond comfortable offering good arch support and comfort. 
I have a bunion on one foot and because the shoes are stretchy in that area it makes them unbelievably comfortable for me. I usually wear an 8 1/2 in tennis shoes but sized down to an 8 and they fit perfect with a thin sock. These are my new go to shoe!!",97377218

KDO46,4,02/13/2017,Really good trainers! I was a bit unsure of these trainers when I first put them on as the edges hurt my feet a little but as soon as I stood up they felt perfect. I do lots of running on a treadmill and these trainers have the right amount of cushion in them to support my feet. You can see the outline of your toes which is the only negative for me. Overall I am happy with them.,81535179

KDO46,5,01/11/2017,"The perfect shoe FOR WOMEN! There is nothing feminine about this shoe. It fits well, its a slim fit. Great for gents with wide feet. The sole IS BLACK. Unlike most of Adidas's clown like colour designs (which I may add look like 12 year olds choose the colour combinations) and to top it off they go perfect with jeans. No strange proportions from the sides and from the front they are sleek. You can find something like this elsewhere BUT NOT with this leading edge technology. Its not rocketscience Adidas, how about you make this unisex, or release a version for males? We always miss out on your most elegant shoe designs.",78316515
KDO46,5,01/07/2017,"Good buy Love these shoes, bought them in pink and the look just look just like the picture except the tongue of the shoe comes higher up than what it looks like in the picture, but I really like it.

I wrote to Adidas customer service and they said that I could return it. I planned on doing that but my mother already tried to help and glue it back on. It doesn't look good.

The lux is very lightweight and comfortable. They also dry fast due to the material used on the the top casing your foot. However this stretchy/cloth/socklike material can be very delicate if snagged on something. I've only had mine two weeks, worn them to Disneyland and had to problems. But I fell down when I was running and gained a hole close to the laces of the shoe. I would recommend them, just keep a close eye on what you do in them!",74031256

KDO46,2,10/21/2016,"Comfortable and stylish but hole within one month This was my first Adidas purchase for myself and I was very excited to find a stylish running shoe that could handle my large bunions. The wider mesh and seam-free toe box were the selling points. I managed to wear them one month before a hole developed in the right bunion area. The sole as well also started wearing down in the heel area. Please note that I wear these for running for 30 minutes or walking now and then. Very disappointing quality. Yes, my large bunions may cause more stress to the fabric but a hole within one month is inexcusable low quality.",73279998

KDO46,5,10/19/2016,"Best purchase ever.! These shoes are the closest thing to perfection. They are sooo comfortable and sooo nice. When I saw them online I was instantly attracted to the style of these shoes but when I received them, I fell in love. The style is sooo unique. I've never had that kind on stretch material on a shoe before but that's what makes them soo comfy. This material literally hugs your feet.! These are perfect if you walk a lot or if you're constantly standing. I workout a lot so I'm always soar and these shoes help me walk without any discomfort. I wouldn't recommend them to work out because of the material the shoe is made of but I would definitely use them for everything else. The comfort level on this show is hard to explain but I was soo obsessed that I bought them in black as well. I ordered these shoes in a size 8 because that's my size most of the time but they fit me big so I got 7.5. So I would size them down half a size. Another thing about this shoe is that it is perfect for people with side feet because normally you have to mold your feet to fit the shoe but with this one, the shoe mold to your feet. Which is amazing.! I definitely recommend these.",73089207

They really do feel like socks, but have tons of great support. And I've gotten so many compliments on them! They're so stylish. I wear them to the gym and everyday with jeans. After having purchased and returned a very uncomfortable pair or nikes--the air max theas--I am overjoyed with the edge luxe and I'll continue to buy Adidas shoes from now on. I got them in white. They have a nice subtle beige design. Laces are awesome! Okay I'm obsessed with these shoes. BUY THEM!",73034495

KDO46,5,10/16/2016,I love these shoes! Very light and comfortable. I ordered these shoes to mostly be worn for just chores around the house or a quick pair to throw on when I go to the store. Since getting them I have even worn them to the gym and they worked great! I absolutely love these shoes and always get compliments!,72903993
KDO46,4,10/15/2016,"Lovely, stylish, highly recommended Comfortable and stylish product. The thin sock-like upper makes for a snug fit, but it is also a little too thin and I could see the outline of my toes through the upper material - needless to say there is little protection provided if anything drops on my feet. However, this means it is super breathable. Both plus and minus on this feature. Otherwise lovely shoes, would highly recommend.",72872033

KDO46,3,10/13/2016,"Love how the shoes feel, but a hole happened near the front of the shoe as soon as I wore them. Cheaply made. The shoes got a hole in them within the first week of wearing them. Near the front of the shoe. I really love how these shoes feel, they are flexible, comfortable, and quite stylish. I'm super disappointed that this hole happened as soon as I wore them. They are athletic shoes and not just for show, so I feel like they should be more durable. Not sure how the hole happened.",72696313

KDO46,5,09/24/2016,"I recommend these shoes for running, training, or just walking. They are sure good looking shoes.

KDO46,4,09/21/2016,"Love these! Love the gray! Very easy to get on and off. By the picture, the laces look like straps but they are tie laces. The thicker laces make it look cool. I have a very high arch so not much support there to be used for running or extensive training. Overall a very good sneaker for everyday use.",71638122
KDO46,5,09/21/2016, These shoes are so comfortable!! They silhouette on them is feminine and cool. A coworker of mine actually walked by and doubled back to peek his head into my work space to tell me he liked them the first day I wore them.,71623751

KDO46,1,09/19/2016,"Not worth the price They are a thin sock like material that your toes show through, not very durable & definitely worth the price",71533162

KDO46,5,09/14/2016,"Definitely recommend these shoes! Extremely cute and comfortable! I love these shoes! They are extremely comfortable and stylish. I'm usually an 8.5 but in all my running shoes I am an 8, so that is what I purchased in this pair and the fit is perfect! Love the white color although it has a bit of tan in it, just to know as a heads up incase you're really looking for a stark white shoe.",71331609
KDO46,5,09/12/2016,"Soooo in love with these I love these shoes, they have everything I could ask for style and comfort. Just ordered them in white and plan to order a few more different colors. Scotchguard is a must if you want to keep them clean.",71228920
KDO46,5,09/10/2016," the colour is perfect,a little wide for slim feet.",71165768
KDO46,5,09/07/2016,"Better for the price, especially compared to Nike prices. no tongue-- so nothing slides and no adjusting. Paid 1/3 less for them than the nikes I usually purchase every season-- and these are aesthetically and physically more impressive. my only con is that the toes feel loose due to the material used. I also usually wear around an 8 but ordered a 7.5 and they are NOT snug, so I believe I can say the sizes must run big.",71028720
KDO46,5,09/05/2016,"Super comfy! I love these shoes because they're super comfy while also on trend. I purchased the white/red color which look more tan/off white/red, but I actually like the color more than I did in the picture. They're very versatile and can be paired with jeans, shorts, or athletic gear. I purchased for casual wear but they're so comfy that I plan to make them my go to running shoes",70925986

The style is different but similiar to other athletic shoes. Classic!! Beautiful Colors. I just wish you would restock the color pink. have the blue and black. Beautiful, comfortable, stylish athletic shoe. Thank you.",70786904
KDO46,5,09/02/2016,"Good for wide feet It is super comfortable, lovely color but a bit pinker then I expected. It is more on the orange side when view from the photo.

KDO46,5,08/30/2016,Comfortable and also attractive They support my feet for my workouts and also look good too,70651456
KDO46,4,08/25/2016,"Good Buy I think first off the color is amazing, and the overall fit of the shoe is great! Bit snug compared to other shoes in general, although not complaining as it contours your foot well.",70473246
KDO46,5,08/18/2016,"Not usually a trainer person, but these are worth every penny Very classy looking. Extremely comfortable and is a good item in anyones wardrobe.",70112494
KDO46,5,08/17/2016,I hope they never stop selling these! I love these shoes so much! I initially ordered 8.5 because I vary between 8 and 8.5 and I read reviews saying to order larger because of the snug fit but I exchanged them for an 8 due to too much room in the toe. The 8 is perfect and I love them so much! So comfortable- they also have great support as I have flat feet! I got the blue and now bought a second pair in the gray. The gray will be for everyday wear and I'll use the blue as my gym shoes!,70098349

KDO46,4,08/10/2016,Comfortable shoe Love the style and comfort - however they were kind of dirty like they had been returned - I didn't expect that getting them directly from Adidas.com ...

KDO46,5,08/04/2016,Great product Excellent product really struggled with pain when running and the comfort and support from these trainers have made the world of difference,69477888
KDO46,2,08/02/2016,"Disappointing purchase I bought these shoes for a comfortable pair of lifestyle shoes, not to work out in by any means. After two weeks of wearing them around the seam around the ankle ripped. These shoes are super comfortable but wish the quality would have been better. A waste of money for a pair of shoes that will not last more than a month.",69415335

KDO46,4,07/28/2016,"Color looks different I eyed these shoes in the faded pink color for the longest time, when I finally ordered them I was surprised at how much pinker they actually were. the picture makes it look like a faded color when in reality it is a bright pink. Overall still a very cute shoe.",69251695
KDO46,4,07/27/2016,"Super nice color and I Love how comfortable They are!! First time I get Adidas running shoes, Ive always been a Nike shoe freak, these pair of shoes did not disappoint, unfortunately I have 7,5 in Nike and ordered the same in these Adidas and they ended up being too big, so double check your sizing before buying these.",69179907
KDO46,4,07/24/2016,"Great purchase The shoes are very comfortable, but a little hard to get on. It is definitely worth the money.",69050374
KDO46,5,07/23/2016,Great Perfect mix of running shoe with comfort and support and fashion.,68977591
KDO46,5,07/19/2016,Cute Buy What attracted me to the sneakers at first were the laces which makes them look sleeker and it doesn't draw attention away from the shoe. Bought these for work and I must say they're pretty comfy for walking long periods of time. They are sock like so I don't know if socks are meant to be worn with them but when I did my feet were slightly hot but not super uncomfortable. I've gotten many compliments on this shoe and the laces in a particular. I would say to size up half a size because while they are meant to feel like a sock they should still fit like a sneaker meaning having a little tiny bit of wiggle room,68803740
KDO46,5,07/18/2016,Makes me want to run!! They are so cushioned and I love the wide straps. Also the way it wraps around the foot gives a perfect supportive fit.,68799147
KDO46,4,07/17/2016, Sooo comfy. Saw them in the store and I just had to get them. I love the look of it. The only thing I'm kind of eh about is how I can see the outline of my feet.. Yikes.,68763422
KDO46,5,07/17/2016,"Best purchase in a long time I love Edge Lux...I have flat feet (no arches) and they fit perfectly. I am on my feet at work all day and at the end of the day, my feet are not painful like they used to be. I have already purchased two pairs and will be ordering more.",68763421

KDO46,5,07/13/2016, it is so comfortable WALKING AND RUNNING SHOE GOOD FOR TRACK,68647830
KDO46,2,07/11/2016," I received these Edge Luxe Shoes in the Adidas Avenue A subscription box with a few other items. I loved them immediately but put them on for a few hours and they were a bit tight around the base of my foot. I don't usually need a wide but maybe with this pair I do. So, not a big deal but I went to put them on again and realized that rubber on the tip of the shoe is peeling back. Again, I wore these for just a few hours at my desk job and they are falling apart? Not happy with the selection of this box. Especially since the FitU watch isn't accurate in step counting and I've reached out to support several times and received no instructions that have worked or made the tracker work properly. It's been calibrated, I did a hard factory reset and yet I still gain 1000 or more steps while sitting in my car in a two hour commute everyday. I really love Adidas but I am so disappointed with these last few items.",68574821
KDO46,4,07/10/2016, I brought these for my daughter i received them yesterday she love's them. The only thing is I brought white but is more beige so if you'll looking for a all white sneakers don't get these...other then that a great sneakers...ENJOY!!!,68546685
KDO46,4,07/08/2016,"good price for the good shoes super comfy and light weight, it was a bit tight when i first wear it, but after few steps i felt great.",68500789

KDO46,4,06/15/2016,Very cute and comfortable! I love the pink color! Looks exactly like the picture!,67619613
KDO46,3,06/12/2016,"Could look even more awesome if laces weren't awkward. I bought this shoe to wear on vacation with lots of walking (not running). I really like the shoe for its general design and comfort. The only thing that is awkward is the lacing. It's hard to lace it in a way that avoids tying a front knot because it's hard to tuck the laces in the shoe. There's no lace hole to insert the laces back through the inside. Instead, you have to tuck the laces over the side of the shoe :/ The site picture shows the laces tucked over the edge as I describe. Visible and awkward.",67475898
EGA42,3,12/26/2017,great shoe for price I like the upper and inside feel of the shoe but the toe part is too narrowed. It's more narrowed than the pureboost I brought. I feel there is not enough support on the lateral movement. I feel like it's ok for running but nkot good for normal walking. It feels like comfortable socks with bad foundation support. You should try It in the stores vs pureboost and you shall see what I mean.,98450439
EGA42,5,11/29/2017,Best shoe But i want triple white color for this shoe or cream white,97590201
EGA42,5,11/11/2017,"Most comfortable shoe ever If you ever try this shoe on, you will be amazed at how comfortable and stable it is and you won't want to wear another. I really love it and hope it's quality remains the same in the long run.",96988545
EGA42,5,10/20/2017," As a cross country runner, Ultraboost ST is one of the most comfortable and supportive shoes. Highly recommended",94535153
EGA42,5,10/14/2017,Most comfortable I have ever worn Extremely conformable to wear and look really good.,94342762
EGA42,5,09/29/2017,"Great shoes, inaccurate color What I thought I was buying was the best pair of blue shoes ever. What I got was the best pair of TEAL shoes ever. It’s not even close. 
As for the shoes, best, most comfortable runners I’ve ever owned. I bought black and red, which are actually black and orange, but at least they are close. The blue isn’t even remotely close.",93710896
EGA42,4,08/21/2017,"Superb in comfort but needs more quality control I've always preferred Air Max for my runs but after constant nags by my friend over past few months, I finally gave in to the Boost technology. I prefer extra support at the arch, so decided to go with the Ultraboost ST. This is definitely way more comfortable than I had expected. I had read so many reviews saying it feels like walking on the cloud and now I know it wasn't really exaggeration, it does feel like you're walking on the cloud. I have no regrets spending $$$ on this but I do have one complaint. The stitching at end of the tongue (towards the front side) on my right shoe kind of touches the left top of my foot. I don't feel it if I'm wearing a thick sock but it irritates me a bit with my regular/sports socks. Also, I have tried wearing the shoe without socks and I'm 100% sure I'll get a blister if I'm on my foot for a couple of hours in these without a sock. The left side shoe is perfect! And it's not just my foot because I've asked my friend to try it and he felt the same thing. This is not a problem if I'm wearing any sock but for a $190 pair, I expected a better quality control.",92465224

BEZ75,3,11/05/2017,Way too big Unfortunately I had to return these. I think I’d have to try them on in a store. I ordered them in the normal size I usually use for adidas ultra boosts and these felt almost a full size too large. I’ve never had that happen before. But they felt comfy and looked great!,96620297

BEZ75,2,10/30/2017,runs large loved the support in the footbed. unfortunately i wore them maybe for 5 workouts and they stretched out so bad i had zero support. the shoe was slipping and sliding so bad that my feet cramped up and my IT band hurt so bad I was unable to run after. extremely disappointing for a $200 pair of running shoes.,95607514

BEZ75,4,09/09/2017,Fantastic comfort only issue is they are narrow but extremely comfortable. I went up a half size as I do with all my running however found these narrower than my other adidas boost. As comfort goes these are a great distance shoe.,93073113
BEZ75,5,08/21/2017, Love them!! They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned!  My son loves his as well!,92466114
BEZ75,5,08/10/2017,"ULTRA BOOST ST IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME I absolutely LOVE the Ultra Boost ST. They have a traditional upper, not the stiff / tight sock style that most running shoes now have. They are so comfortable and the boost adds a little oophf. They are hands down my favorite pair of shoes. I just bought another pair because I love the first pair I bought a year ago so much and was worried they wouldn't be available. The color options were meh. I was lucky to have got grey/blue... but as a women, I DON'T want pink and purple and I'm tired of them being the only options or secondary color option (like pops of color).",91840179

First of all i gotta say these shoes are REDICULOUSLY COMFORTABLE . I love the noise boost makes everytime they step. However i have to say that the plastic pieces on the shoes did not hold up well.

They should maybe running shoes for actual men with man size feet. I digress, bottom line is, I returned them and if you have wide feet look elsewhere",95816950
CBY27,5,10/30/2017,"These are a must for Runners/Sneakerheads I recently bought a pair of UltraBOOST and I can't get over how comfortable they are, The Primeknit is so breathable and stretchy and comfortable, but the most important of all, the boost midsole, the boost is incredibly responsive (Much more responsive then that of the NMD) And every time you take a single step, you feel the energy being absorbed and returned, its an amazing feeling, I could walk all day in these shoes, These do run narrow so people with wide feet, if you are a size 10 than go up half a size (or true to size) because these run true to size, if you have a narrow foot you should probably go for your same size, These are amazing, I highly recommend you buy these.",95638373

CBY27,4,10/28/2017,"Great shoes, but a few drawbacks. I was lucky enough to get my ultra boosts in the size and color I wanted and was very pleased with them until the actual boost mid sole detached from the prime knit upper and also caused a crack/split vertically in the boost. Another somewhat minor problem is the fraying that occurs arond the toe area, but this can be dealt with using a fabric shaver. Overall I really liked the shoe but I was displeased with the incident regarding the separation of sole and upper.",95123703
CBY27,4,10/27/2017,They are great but the continental bottom does not last as long as expected. Yeah this product is awesome I recommend them especially if your foot is narrow.

CBY27,1,10/27/2017, These shoes fell apart after less than a month and a half of wearing them. Terrible quality for the price. The sol of the shoe began to completely separate from the top. Would not recommend for the price as they will only fall apart shortly after purchase,95014470
CBY27,5,10/25/2017,"Best comfort out there Let me start by saying I haven't owned a pair of Adidas shoes since high school. With that said these shoes are amazing. I've own quite a few of other brands but the comfort in these have left me not wearing any other shoes. The type of comfort is not comparable to any of them. I would put it to feel like a high quality memory foam mattress. They are built very well it seems like (I watched a YouTube video where someone wore them a year and tentatively put 1000 miles on them, they were the V. 1s though) I wear them whenever I'm off work since I have to wear boots at work. If I was to guess I'd say I have put easily 50 miles on them with no sign of wear on the tread. They are getting dirty on the primeknit and the Boost material, but only the primeknit because my wife and I have a 3 month old German Shepherd that love to step on them when we are outside. The fit for me is perfect, some might say they are snug but I like my shoes like that, I ordered my normal size. As they look right now I am willing to say they will last years for me. I have no complaints about these shoes at all and I can't wait to see what newer versions will bring. The only thing I wish they would do in the future is bring back the limited edition leather cage ones.",94872637

CBY27,5,10/25/2017,Underrated Colorway. This colorway of the Ultraboost 3.0 is highly underrated. They look great on foot n I prefer them to a few of my limited edition colorways. They r Ultraboost so the comfort is great n need not be mentioned but I mentioned it anyway since they’re that comfy. U can’t go wrong with ANY Ultraboost but this colorway is a sleeper. Wake up n cop folks.,94858356
CBY27,4,10/25/2017,"Good buy, but Continental outsole sub-par I have been a long time other brand shoe fan, but I loved this shoe since the first time I tried them on. Great fit, feel, comfort, and style, but once I bought  them I realized that the outsole provided little if any traction in the gym or any smooth surface. It almost seems like the outsole has been worn down for a long time, even though they are brand new. I still love them, just wish the continental outsole was better.",94774994

I wasn't a huge fan of the look at first (you know the whole styrofoam packing shell thing as the sole), but once I wore them for a day, I just don't even care anymore.

I came from wearing roshes but they were incredibly uncomfortable when wearing for long periods of time, especially when running even a mile. I went for a run immediately after my ultraboosts came in the mail and it made running feel effortless. If you do have a pair of roshes and they fit snug,  you should order a half size up in this shoe. You will have a little toe room but I had to compensate for the width of my foot. Other than that, amazing shoe and 10/10 would buy again.",94019452

When I got the shoe, I realized it was defective, with a bump on the prime knit of my left shoe. It causes irritation when I run for longer distances. It was also glued badly, causing different toe space for each shoe. The feeling that my left feet feels different from my right is very annoying.

I think that the camouflage would look absolutely fantastic on these shoes. I also think that this would boost your selling rate of these shoes because, people have to go to other websites or people to get these custom made shoes and your losing some business by not having this color. I do hope to see this in the future.",93654140

CBY27,3,09/24/2017,"Very nice, one annoying flaw I really like the shoes except for one thing. The soles get dirty on the side and they don't come clean at the seams. There is no way to avoid this so you end up with shoes that look dirty right away no matter how careful you are. Otherwise great shoes for lounging or walking. Not for sports but that's ok. For me if the shoes are stylish and for walking and also expensive, I don't want them looking dirty. So unfortunately I can't recommend them.",93513487

CBY27,5,09/21/2017,"Best purchase ever! About five months ago I purchased a pair of Adidas Ultra Boost running shoes. I saw these shoes all over social media and wanted to see what the hype was about. After doing some research, many people claimed these to be the most advanced and the most comfortable running shoes on the market. These shoes were designed for runners but I have seen many people wearing them as a fashionable shoe as well. I bought the triple white Ultra Boosts the summer after my sophomore year in college. I chose these shoes because I love the design of these shoes and I walk a lot in college so I wanted a comfortable shoe. I have discovered through a couple months of wear that durability, comfort, and style of these chose have been better than any other shoe I’ve ever purchased.

Durability
I have worn my white ultra boosts almost everyday since I’ve gotten them. I walk to all my classes in college and my campus is pretty large. Other shoes I have would either wear out on the bottoms, or I would get a hole in the shoe somewhere. Since I have had these shoes they have shown minimal wear. The tread on the bottom is practically new and the upper part of the shoe has no holes or any sort of distress. I believe these shoes will last me for quite some time. 

Comfort
These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. I wear these shoes everyday and walk a lot. Whenever I would have a long walk to class, my feet would usually start hurting. I don’t have that issue anymore with these shoes. The thick “boost” sole of the shoe absorbs each step better than any other shoe I own. Also the sock-like upper material of the shoe is very breathable and flexible. These shoes are so comfortable that sometimes I forget I’m wearing them.

Style
Along with durability and comfort, the new shoes I purchase also have to look good. This Is one of the main reasons I bought these. I love the thick white “boost” foam that runs along the bottom of the shoe. Also, the fact that the laces are separate from the shoe is a great feature that makes these shoes different from the competition. On the back of the shoe, the material comes up a bit higher creating a tab, and although this is a small feature, I think it looks great. In my opinion, the Ultra Boosts are the best looking shoe on the market.

Negatives
After wearing these shoes almost everyday for a few months I have considered these to be the best shoe I have ever purchased. I love almost everything about them, but nothing Is perfect. The sock-like upper material is excellent for comfort and breathability, but not great for any kind of cutting or fast direction changes while running. Also these shoes are priced at a firm $180. This is pretty expensive for a running shoe but I am glad I made the commitment to buying them. Also I got the triple white color way which is pretty hard to keep clean, but that is to be expected when buying all white shoes. 

All in all, these shoes are the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased. They are one of the most sought after shoes in the running and style categories. That being said, the Ultra Boosts live up their hype. Their durability, comfort, and style are better than any other shoes I’ve ever bought. If you walk/run a lot and love a fashionable shoe, I highly recommend getting the Ultra boosts.",93447126

BUT, after a while, I have noticed that the area where the toe hits the prime knit stretches out - even when i use socks 100% of the time. I use this shoes for work in a carpeted clinic and sometimes for running in a pavement but never on trail. Then today what I thought was dirt was actually a HOLE in the primeknit. Considering that this is a $180 shoe, it should last longer than 6 months. I have sent a message to customer service and I am hoping this will fixed or refunded. Will keep you guys  posted.

They are very stylish and look good with any outfit. Also a great shoe to wear to the gym. I purchased the triple whites and over time they got very dirty which happens with any pair of all white shoes.

CBY27,4,08/22/2017,"The hype is real I, like most people, was a little skeptical of how a shoe could be priced the way it is. Sure it's an investment, but from the moment I put them on they were the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Although these shoes are super comfortable, I do believe after a long time standing in them they may start to lose their signature comfort ( a little too soft if that makes sense) and also if you have them up tightly they may strain your foot. This however should not scare you from buying the shoe, the investment was very much worth it. The style and supreme comfortability make this my go-to shoe for years to come.",92489216

CBY27,3,07/19/2017,Poorly made will wear away continental tire in 3 months. Really adidas?second pair n it keeps busting through to the boost. How is this quality? Bottom tread wears out after 3months!Unacceptable. My first pair did the same thing. I walk a bunch but these are made for running. Are u running indoors on padded floors because tread will wear away quick on the street. Adidas should offer a warrantee that the continental has to last strong at least 6months. Why wouldn't u just make that thicker?Just because they're comfortable doesn't mean the soul should wear out so fast. And i rotate my sneakers. I'm so heated-adidas and their technology need an upgrade on the souls. Weak craftsmanship. Only have a month return policy-obviously they should last a month!Ridiculous,90628978

KEH54,5,02/10/2017,"Best Running Shoes I have Purchased My Uses for the Adidas Ultraboost Uncaged Shoes:
Currently I use these shoes for running and working out at the gym. I work out in the gym on average one hour and 15 minutes per day, also I generally run roughly 15 miles per week. The sort of conditions that I run on are gravel, asphalt, and grass. Also wear these shoes when going to class for 8+ hours per day.

Comfortability:
For the uses I have stated above the Ultraboost shoes are an easy 5/5 for comfortability. I have tried many different types of running shoes, primarily from Nike and Adidas, but none have been able to apply appropriate support for the differing terrains that I work out on. Though for the Ultraboosts that I recently purchased, even when running on large gravel a sizeable portion of the impact is absorbed. Overall comfortability is the best that I have experienced from any running shoes I have purchased in the past.

Durability:
If you are like me then you tend to go through quite a few pairs of shoes per year. Like with most shoes you will likely try to keep them at least somewhat clean for as long as possible. This will likely require you to wash the shoes more than once. While most other shoes in the past that you have tried washing will begin to wear out after one or two washes the Ultraboosts will still remain looking nearly brand new. I have washed mine 3 times already and they still look almost brand new through all of the mud and other stains that I have gotten on them. Overall durability is outstanding and the new shoe look has lasted the longest with the Ultraboosts.

Support:
For running on uneven ground especially you likely will want plenty of support from your shoes. The arch support that you get with the Ultraboosts is by far the best that I have experienced from other running shoes that I have tried. For ankle support for someone with weaker ankles like myself it is somewhat lacking. This can be corrected just by wearing a light ankle brace and I use one for all of my running shoes anyway. Overall for support I would still consider it one of the top running shoes.

Ending Summary:
Overall if you are looking for a durable, comfortable, and supportive shoe you should really give the Ultraboosts a try. It is a great investment for the average runner and will last you a long time.",81472227
KEH54,5,02/07/2017,"Great shoe and that color! Let's start with this is an Ultra Boost so what else we can say?

I decided to buy a pair of ultra boosts because I wanted to branch out for the first time. Let me tell you, I am SO HAPPY that I decided to go with the ultra boosts and not a pair of nike racers. Because these are the most comfortable** pair of shoes  I have ever worn. This beats flyknits, racers, roshes, any pair of Nike shoes I have worn. Seriously, best shoes ever.",73136499
KEH54,5,10/19/2016,"One of a kind! These are my first Ultra Boosts and they are fantastic! very confortable and cool looking design. The only thing... Adidas should suggest what kind of socks to wear, because some them can bother with the ankle collar.",73094379
KEH54,1,10/16/2016,The shoes did not look as sleek as the picture and poor quality. The material tore the first day of wearing them I did not like the material it seemed cheaply made and unraveled after one wearing,72896531

After I put these on it was apparent what I was missing out on, they are incredibly comfortable and I now wear them everyday because the style is modern and nice as well.

KEH54,3,10/04/2016,Would have got another shoe if had know this would occur. The back of the sock on the shoe digs into my skin and opens wounds around my achilles. I had to start putting bandages or wraps in this area to protect my skin!,72287136

It makes my foot feel very stable and balanced. They almost have a bouncy like feel to them in the heel and they are super light.

Very comfortable and I love them, my size 10 fit perfectly. In the sneaker community, I was told the Ultra Boost are even more comfortable than the NMD's. So I bought a pair of 2.0's and absolutely LOVE them. I haven't taken my Ultra Boost off in months now! I am a true believer now, so much that I sold my entire Nike Air Jordan collection (35 pair) in the attempt to buy the next best Adidas called the Yeezy Boost 350 Pirate Black. Although I still haven't been able to buy any Yeezy Boost 350 in a size 10, I am looking forward to the next Yeezy Boost to be released via Adidas.com so I can hopefully have the opportunity to buy a pair!",70711816

KEH54,5,08/16/2016,"These shoes are good for ANYTHING I LOVE these shoes. I'm a fitness instructor and I only buy Adidas shoes. I have both the Ultra Boost and Ultra Boost Uncaged for running. The Uncaged has more cushioning on the ball of the foot vs. the 1st gen. Ultra Boost. On the 1st gen. there is a slight forward lean (less forefoot cushioning) that assists with forward propulsion while running. Since the Uncaged has more forefoot cushioning, that forward lean is gone, but I also love the extra cushioning. The 1st gen. is a little more snug in the toe box, where as the Uncaged has just a little bit more room. I love the sock fit at the ankle and the padding inside the heel cup feels amazing. The Continental rubber sole also provides a more noticeable grip on the ground over the 1st gen, but I believe you can get the Continental rubber sole on the 1st gen. also. You can't go wrong with the 1st gen. or the Uncaged. Both are amazing. I personally own 2 pair (1st gen & Uncaged), I have bought my fiance 2 pair (both 1st gen) and I recently bought my 15 year old daughter a pair (1st gen). She started band camp and was using a different pair of running shoes that left her with blisters on her toes after marching for 5 hours. She switched to her Ultra Boost and I haven't heard one complaint about her feet hurting. These shoes are good for ANYTHING.",70018864

I have unhealed stress fractures and fallen arches from years of pounding from gymnastics and typically my feet ache unbearably after 30 minutes or so of activity but with these I can be on my feet comfortably all day and even run moderate distances without pain. I love them so much that I have been trying to snap them up in every color whenever I see my size in stock (which is not often since they are so popular). I'm a bit of a sneaker collecter - I have hundreds of pairs - but these are probably my all-time favorites.,69503547

KEH54,5,07/13/2016,"A gift for my wife, she loves them! My wife is a very avid runner, she hated the Brooks Ghost 9 she previously wore.  These are really the shoe she was searching for.  A more comfortable sole than the Nike Free, but more lightweight than the Brooks Ghost.  Basically one of the best lightweight runners on the market.",68613143
KEH54,3,07/12/2016, The shoes overall look great but when I wore them without socks the back part starting making A blister on the back is my foot. I think the tab comes up too high. At times the fabric feels too tight around my foot so much so that it tingles. Other than that the shoes are super comfortable to walk in. I'm hoping that by wearing socks I'll eliminate the blister issue and that the shoes will stretch out just a bit.,68607539
KEH54,3,07/12/2016," The shoe is really great quality. Very well produced. However, the sock liner was too tight for my liking. I felt like it would have rubbed my ankles raw when running in them, so I returned them.",68602070
KEH54,5,07/12/2016,"Best Boost ever I have owned several versions of Boost.  This is the best one yet.  Light, super comfortable, and the best use of the amazing Boost material yet.  I so wish Adidas would make just one version with zero or 4 heel drop.",68601628

KEH54,5,07/11/2016," Love the ultra boost, so the uncaged version is great as well. Just getting used to the sock portion of the shoe hugging my ankle.",68573585
KEH54,3,07/11/2016,"Must wear higher socks for that Saw-like stitch. Everything you can ask for in a UB, sock-like feel and no cage tightness for us wide footers. However, if you plan on actually wearing these for running beware of the back stitch at the ankle opening.  After running for about a mile, you can start to really feel it rubbing on the Achilles. Changed to a higher sock and you won't notice it but the fact that I have to adjust my sock preference for a $180+ shoe is not what I wanted. That one stitch is what bothers me the most so unless you wear socks with heel tabs or plan to put band aids at the back then these are good to go.  But I will be returning these since I use UB ST and the adizero prime for most runs and I don't need another ""casual"" UB since I have the 1st generation on rotation.",68573405
KEH54,5,07/11/2016,Love these! Amazing feel - perfect cushion - should've sized up 1/2 size though.,68573131
KEH54,5,07/11/2016,"Most comfortable shoe ever Absolutely loved the uncaged, unfortunately it ran about one shoe size too big. It was my first time ordering their ultraboosts so I can't say if it was this particular shoe that ran big or the brand.",68571343

KEH54,5,07/11/2016,"Better than NMD This product is very comfortable. It is good for running and walking. It used the highest boost technology for runners to improve speed. By the fashion way, black and grey primeknit is very cool. I love that colour. The only thing that I don't like is that the three stripes at the front. I hope adidas can remove them.",68550777

Super shoe!!",68531265
KEH54,5,07/10/2016,"Best ultra boosts ever The ultra boost uncaged absolutely surpassed all my expectations in comfort, fit, support and style! The sock like fit was perfect and held the shoe in place without any uncomfortable rubbing at the heel, which I found with my Tubular Virals/

I could walk, run and train for days on the ultra boost sole - lightweight, bouncy and responsive. The slight curved geometry lends perfectly to my natural stride and helps cushion impact on runs.

As for style, the core black colourway is a hard one to beat. Coordinates with anything and everything, but I particularly love the gold lace tips for detail.

If there's any stock left, definitely buy a pair. If not, I feel for you.",68530814

KEH54,3,07/05/2016,"Sock cuff not great; stripes design = disaster Go with the original. The NMD-like sock cuff isn't very comfortable and the implementation (design, placement) of the three stripes is pretty awful. Why impose these new ""features"" when people were already clamoring for the uncaged approach they loved in all the collaborations? I will say the inner support is fantastically clever but since more people generally (and sneakerheads specifically) would be interested in this as a lifestyle shoe based on established uncaged aesthetics, why mess with it? The stripes just look so lame. I sent my black pair back immediately.",68368250
KEH54,5,07/02/2016,Best shoes ever these shoes are amazing. So happy with my purchase. So comfortable and look amazing. Only things for me are they are a bit wide at the feet and looked a little blue when i received them. They also don't have much of an arch for my foot so I'll probably need a insole.,68256299
KEH54,5,06/30/2016,"Good quality with reasonable price I like it coz it's really comfortable. Suitable for shopping, casual wear and lighth sports! Also with reasonable price.",68178872
CCX10,3,12/28/2017,"Stronger tread will last longer, no arch support, no insert, oddly only seem runs down middle of big toe, had to return:( The shoe is quality, the sole runs a little wider allowing for more balance. Shoe breathability is tops. Tread is of higher quality than ultra boost and will last longer. You must add your own insert for comfort no arch support at all. Seem running down the center of big toe gave me blisters. I really wanted to keep them but had to return for this reason.",98518831
CCX10,5,12/27/2017,Very comfortable! Great shoe that is very comfortable. Love the fabric material.,98501447

CCX10,1,12/26/2017,"Decent shoe, not high quality After receiving these shoes I was happy to try them on and find that they fit true to size and were comfortable. I wore them to the gym the following day and after about an hour of playing basketball, a tear in the foam sole near the front of the shoe developed. Really disappointed in the quality of the product as I only got one day of use out of them. I would not recommend purchasing these unless you plan to just look at them.",98468384
CCX10,3,12/18/2017,"Where's the insole?? Nice design and slightly uncomfortable . No insoles, Why? Older boost much much much better. Not recommend",98261835

CCX10,5,11/30/2017,SOOO much better then I expected They size super big (the difference between wearing a fashion sock and a wool sock). They are the most comfortable shoes I can remember buying plus they look great.,97650329
CCX10,5,11/20/2017,"Diverse shoes for any situation. My first wear of these was for about a 3 mile hike in Hong Kong's Dragon's Back trail. These shoes handled the stairs, rocks, roots, paved road, and dirt road like champs. No slipping and was able to grip everything. I have wide, sensitive feet and these did the job. Definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn. Trust me, I have never written a shoe review until this one.",97320730
CCX10,1,11/09/2017,"Uncomfortable and not water resistant at all. Poor tongue design and awkward seam make these very uncomfortable.

CCX10,4,10/20/2017,"Pure boost 3 was better This is a great shoe. I think the comfort and whole shoe dynamic is a step down for me compared to the pure boost 3. If I could but more of the 3s, I would do that. The exclusion of an insole left me to buy my own separately and is a disappointment. This is the first time a burrito tongue has worked for me. I wish Adidas would make this in pure black with no color texture, for work. 
These have the same outsoles as the non atr pure boost models. So I'm not sure why they call them atr and not all weather. 
Overall, a comfortable shoe that's better than all other brands because of boost.",94527762
CCX10,4,10/17/2017,Very nice shoe- where is insole? I like the shoe but where is the insole? I think it's kind of cheap to make such an expensive shoe and have the wearer feel the tracks on the inside of the shoe.  I feel the older model of pureboost was better than this.,94443430

I am a distance runner and decided to take these out for an 11 mile run last weekend. They have a wide toe box so if you struggle with blisters these are a great option for you to try. Very comfortable and already feel broken in, I love the grip on the bottom. My only complaint is these aren't long marathon distance running shoes..... At least not for me... They just don't have the stability that I need to have a very long distance run. I definitely will reach for these for half marathon running or less.

BEV86,5,11/23/2017,"Most comfy shoe ever! I have Plantars Fasciitis in my left foot, and I have bought so many shoes from ASICS, New Balance, Hoka One One, Nike, Altra, etc., and I have had to either return them or take them to Goodwill because none of them helped my heel pain. I finally was shown some of these at a local shoe store and I was hooked! I am so thankful for that shoe salesman for showing me these. I now own four pair of these to rotate with. I love the look and most importantly the comfort of the boost midsole. I tried NMD’s and the Supernova’s as well, but the Ultra Boost is what has healed my heel pain! I have heard great things about the EQT Support 93/17’s, BUT they don’t make those for women. I do wish Adidas would make those for women so I could get a pair to try! Hint hint! I am thankful they make the Ultra Boost though and I give them a 10 out of 10! I don’t run but I walk a lot and can be on my feet all day and not feel any discomfort, so thank you Adidas!! Boost is life!",97455405
BEV86,4,11/10/2017,"Great purchase! It is a very comfortable soft shoe. Slightly bulky, and the laces have a small ""surface area"" on the top. The top is like a sock and the cage is supportive but not as much as I thought, the shoe was too wide for my foot, they run large. I went with the pure boost instead and I prefer it over the ultraboost! I would recommend both shoes!",96956268
BEV86,5,11/06/2017,"Love these shoes It's probably the best sneakers I've purchased so far. It's very soft and great for running or just walking in daily life.

BEV86,5,10/24/2017,"MY very first Adidas shoes! I have never owned a pairs of adidas in my life, and after having MANY MANY MANY years of feet pain, I have decided to invest in a pair of shoes that will do my feet pain some justice. I have walked a lot in many places like in amusement parks, traveling, school, walking even in my own neighborhood, and by the end of the day, the heal and the center of my feet sting like CRAZY. I do not have flat feet but a very small arch, which contributes to the pain. I would have to massage my feet in order to sleep properly, it's just that bad. Now, after some serious investigating and researching, I have concluded that the adidas ultraboost was the way to go. The reason why I researched these shoes so much is because I never have dropped so much cash in one pair on shoes in my life. I finally decided to order them two weeks ago, and ordered a 7.5 and 8 because a lot of people said to half size down and others said stay true to size. 7.5 reached my toes exactly and after trying on my 8, I noticed the center of my foot was being suffocated. It was perfect in size but too tight in the center. I ended up returning the 7.5 and kept the 8. I ordered an 8.5 (which by the way, took longer than expected to arrive....) and they finally arrived today! I put them on and immediately fell in love. The center of my foot was not suffocating and I felt super comfy in my bouncy shoes that curve to the shape of my foot. I ripped that tag off and officially called them mine. I can't wait for the comfort I am going to feel. I do not run but I do walk a lot. I will be using these these as a daily shoe. If you know you walk a lot or are just on your feet for a very long time, I recommend these shoes. I also remember reading that these shoes squeak a lot, the first two pairs I ordered did squeak a lot!! But the one that arrived today does not squeak, at least on tile. My last recommendation: If you KNOW you have wide feet, I recommend you 1/2 size UP! These are my very first pair of adidas shoes in my whole life. I am looking towards buying another pair soon, gotta be stylish and comfortable!",94680868
BEV86,5,10/24/2017,"One of my best purchase ever At first I was very thought about its price since I never spent for shoes that much.But I was fall in love with this shoes.(Actually,I also tried x all Terrain one,too.but it was very uncomfortable foe me)When I tried for my size I never want to take it off and want to jump so badly because I felt like If I jump,it will be send me very very high.haa!anyway,this is one of great shoe,so I recommend.",94645284

BEV86,5,09/28/2017,"This is a great shoe. Adidas ultra boost is a great shoe. It is really comfortable in the fact that it has boost but also because it supports our feet really well. I have a flat foot and with normal shoes, I got to wear a kind of plating so that it doesn't hurt my feet but with these shoes, without it I could still walk pretty well. I would recommend these but if you think that it's kind of pricey you should go with pure boost or nmd but it should be the R2 because it is way softer than R1. If you really want ultra-boost just wait until it's on sale. Overall this is the most comfortable shoe with great design I've ever worn in my life.",93668359

BEV86,5,09/15/2017,"the hype is real and worth your money Although multiple reviews advised customers to order a half size up, I went with my normal sneaker size (5.5) for the core black and it fit me perfectly. Perhaps the sizing is off on other sizes, but I think if you're the same shoe size as me, ordering a 5.5 should be good enough. It matches what the sizing chart says of it being 22.5 cm, so if you're REALLY unsure, measure your foot!
It's super comfortable, very lightweight, and looks cute with just about any outfit. You won't regret buying it.",93290266

They told me no, to order true to size. So I did, and it was WAY too big. Now I have to return them and they no longer have the size I need.

BEV86,1,04/05/2017,"Low quality shoe that is not worth the insane price. At first when I bought my Boost Ultras I was as happy as could be. They are light, the have great arch support, and feel amazing when I went on runs. But after a short while I realized how poorly they are actually made.
 Within a week the paint of the ultra boost logo scratched away. This was nothing in my mind. But after two months the knitting on the sides of the shoes were quickly begining to tear and stretch out. I would like to point out that I am not an avid runner, so most of the use of these shoes was just from walking. 
Other issues I have had with the shoes include the cheap insoles on in the shoe. Whenever I actually did run on my Ulta boosts, they would bunch up almost instantly, causing discomfort. This happened so often that I opted to just take them out permanently. Out of all of these issues, these are the least of my concerns.
My biggest gripe about these shoes is the lackluster sole on the bottom of the shoe. It is so incredibly thin and wears away so easily. Within 4-5 months they were worn down to the boost foam in some areas. Again 90% of the use of these shoes was just walking and not even running​. Now, by the 9th month of having these shoes, the rubber sole is peeling apart and both of my shoes are torn practically all the way through the shoe near the front where the shoe should naturally bend when running. I really enjoyed these shoes when I first had them, but the are definitely not worth the hefty price for how short the last.",83957662

BEV86,5,12/15/2016,Best ultraboost to date These run a little large especially compared to the 2.0's. Some people say to go half a size down if you want a snug for but I say go true to size. The material on these is a lot loser and less right than previous versions. I'm a big fan of the translucent cage too. Best ultraboost so far,76912356

C568N,3,01/30/2017,"Asics 360 Gel Quantum I bought these pair a month ago to replace my Gel Kayanos. I run about 3 half marathons a year, so was interested in trying something new as I didn't like the color of gel kayano collection this year. The colors were a bit too feminine for me. I bought the yellow neon pair, liked the look and feel of it. As the gel kayanos are stability shoes and 360 quantum were not, I was aware of it when buying it and it was my only concern. However, with the extra 360 gel support I thought it might help and I could opt for a neutral shoe with an amazing color. Although the 360 quantum are comfortable, I got to say I feel the support difference between 360 quantum and gel kayano. In the future, I will stick to the gel kayano, because my feet need the support. I like the 360 quantum, but will opt for support/stability instead of looks next time.",80592623

Asics has asked several times for feedback & here it is.",97512375
C628N,4,09/19/2017,Best comfort I bought these shoes about 5 months age and recently purchased the same shoe different color last week. I have very small feet being a 30 year old man it's tough to find shoes with the support you need in the kids section. I love asics and have always had a pair for running since being the Army we did a lot of that. I now where them in the prison since I am a corrections officer I spend a lot of time on my feet. My only issue with the shoe is quality the gel on my first pair started to deteriorate quickly.  However they are so comfortable I ordered a second pair. I will pay 130 every 5 months if it saves my back from killing me.,93349793
C628N,5,05/10/2017,"Just what I wanted .comfortable. I bought my first Asics shies in 2008.they are still with me though worn out.after wearing ASICs I never wanted to try any other brand period.

Shoes arrived in time.expensive but good.would recommend this brand.",86324874
C628N,5,10/17/2016, It is definitely the best Asics I have tried. Purely perfect. I have only been walking on Asics Kayanos and Nimbus in the past 11 years. Quantum 360 CM just hits the next level.,72927525
C631N,4,09/29/2017,"Great Overall Running Shoe Used to run in Asics till I broke my foot 20 years ago  (Lis Franc Fracture). Due to the severity of the break I am no longer able to enjoy the health benefits nor the mere pleasure of being able to run. I watch other people run and think back to the days when I was one of those healthy, happy runners. I bought a pair of these Asics Bounders for my 10 year old granddaughter who has been involved in 'Girls On The Run' for the last few years. She loved the look and the initial fit till she realized they were too tight around her toe area so we had to send them back. She was very disappointed. I was hoping that Asics would make kids sneakers in wide widths.",93686373

C709N,3,09/20/2017,"Fell apart quickly I bought this shoe for my 6yo one month ago at the Asics outlet store. He absolutely loves them (he picked out the color). However, after barely a month they are falling apart. Several threads are unraveled all over the shoes and the material is pilling. I just expected a little more quality from Asics, and yes, I definitely expect some wear and tear from a 6yo, but I just felt like an Asics shoe would hold up a little better.",93410875

They look great but time will tell, my 6 year old goes through a pair every three months due to wearing a hole in the front sole of other Asics sneakers.  It is due to his walking, running, dragging feet style but am hopeful to get some more time out of the shoes before they are over-worn. Will have to update!",98282233

I've worn previous generation of GEL-Fortitude and was very satisfied with them. However, ASICS appeared to discontinue the Fortitude model for period of time so I was banished to scouring the internet for older models.

The gel cushioning system far outlasts any foam product in other shoes I have used -- I run 3 miles/day, 6 days/wk and I ran 2.5 years on my first pair.  The cushioning around the ankle is excellent as well.  The upper fabric is only so-so but it works -- I'd love to see them add a wider toe box.  I keep coming back to this design (original quantum 360s) because the new ones that I have tried (Quantum 360 CMs) lack the cushioning around the ankle and are very stiff/uncomfortable.",97917904

T641N,3,03/25/2017,not worth the money I will start off with these are by far the most comfortable pair of running shoes I've ever owned. the main purpose of this purchase was because I had a nagging knee pain. after wearing these for a week knee pain was gone. the reason why I say not worth the money is I have yet to even run a mile in the shoes and the tread is starting to fall off. so I'm afraid to see what would happen if I actually started logging miles in these. asics needs to look into a more durable tread if your going to seek shoes at this price!,83309733
T641N,2,03/23/2017,Metarun I'm no big runner this is true but purchased these as wanted to limit any strain on my lower back. Look these trainers are light good looking bouncy but I can't say comfortable. The big problem for me has been sizing . I am a U.K. 8 . I was advised to consider a half size bigger due to foot expansion when hot but decided not and went with a straight 8. They are two big!!!!!!! I should have got a half or even a full size smaller. .

Asics thought of every detail when it came to designing this show inside and out. If you are worried about the price tag, don't be, they are worth for more than price tag that you will pay. There is nothing out there even close to the quality of this shoe. I can not believe what I've been missing! As a practicing Doctor these shoes are great for support, alignment regarding your spine, and comfort. You just can't beat the quality of materials and X- Gel technology along with the I.G.S. Technology. Not to mention Optimized Upper, Flytefoam, Ortholite Sockliner, Heel Clutching System, Adapttruss, and Slopped Duomax. Needless to say this shoe has it all, simply the best.

T646Q,5,11/29/2017,"Best Pair of Asics Yet I've been a faithful wearer of Asics running shoes over the years, and most recently had success with the Asics GT 2000 series - namely the GT 2000-5.  I run between 150 and 200 miles per month and go thru shoes quickly. I'm 5-9 and go about 200 pounds and am a pronator. 

About a month ago I purchased a new pair of GT 2000-5's to replace my prior pair, and the new shoes felt abnormally tight and stiff in the toe box.  Thought maybe they were the wrong size but that wasn't true.  Just figured that since they were new they probably just needed to be broken in a bit to fit more comfortably.  Well, even after 150 miles, the new pair never did feel as comfortable as prior pairs - not even close.  I have noticed the toe box in the 2000-5 shoe seemed a bit more snug than in previous versions, but in this particular pair, they were uncomfortably tighter (for whatever reason). 

So, after years of using the 2000 series shoes, I decided to go with the GEL-Kayano 23 Tokyo's.  This shoe is very comfortable. Most comfortable pair I've ever worn. I read in a review on either this site, or another site, that the Kayano 23 toe box was extremely tight.  Others said it was more roomy.  I took a chance and fortunately for me, the latter was true.  I can definitely say without any hesitation, that the toe box in this shoe has much more room than the 2000 series shoes.

The overall fit and feel of this shoe is much better than the 2000's.  If you're a runner looking for more room in the front of eh shoe, the Kayano 23 might be a good option.  A bit more expensive the some of the other options, but to me, was worth the extra money.",97580307

T648N,5,11/30/2017,"Good shoes I bought these Gel-Kayano 23 (4E) about a month ago and compared to other shoes they are really comfortable and the width gives better room for my feet as I'm running, which again takes away the burning sensation under my sole as I'm training in the Hawaiian heat. With a maraton only 10 days away it's great to run with shoes that fit so well.",97637219
T648N,5,11/29/2017,"Very Comfortable I walk 3 - 5 miles (averaging 4 mph) a day with my Kayano 23's.  The shoes are amazing for my propensity to pronate - I have no discomfort, no soreness in my feet or legs.  They also last about 5 months before I need to replace them.  Thank you for an absolutely great product!",97590339

T648N,5,08/05/2017,"Comfort!!!!! plus good looks I have worn these daily ever since bought several months ago & they are the best shoes I have ever worn -- & I have tried many. Despite constant wear, they have kept their good appearance as well.",91571842
T648N,1,06/22/2017,"Terrible Quality I went running 5 times before the toe grip started peeling off and the shoe fell apart (pictures attached). Like others I have had a terrible experience with the quality with these new versions. I have owned Kayano's for almost 10 years so was deeply disappointed with this. When I asked for a replacement pair the Customer Support team asked me to complete 20 questions including:

•	Your rhythm (speed, length of your runs, frequency of your runs...)
•	The type of terrain you run on (road, trail, forest, mountain...)
•	Secondary use of your shoes (casual use, fitness and training, football…)
•	How do you clean your shoes?

Like my foot rhythm or how I clean my shoe would have anything to do with the shoe falling apart after 5 runs! Ridiculous.",1034551188

T648N,4,05/31/2017,Beautiful shoe but.... I'm about to buy my 20th pair. Love them. Just wish I could buy them on line but the sizing is ambiguous: is it US or UK sizes. Off to the shop again,1033576030
T657N,5,10/22/2017,Great shoe as ASICS normally are :-) I bought these last month and was a bit concerned after reading reviews -- but I am very happy with the shoes! But would suggest you buy a 1/2 size bigger than normal - got a 6 1/2 wide normally wear a 6 wide -- with the extra they fit perfect!,94565530
T657N,1,05/15/2017,Toe box different I always wear this style and size. I returned these. The tie box was pressing down on the tops of my toenails. I also felt they were shorter.,86490160
T657N,1,05/05/2017,Not True to Size These shoes are not true to size ... they were too small. Nice looking shoe but I will never purchase another pair of shoes over the internet.,86098002
T657N,3,05/03/2017,Runs Small I bought this shoe a couple of weeks ago.  It offers plenty of support however I wish i got a half a size bigger.  The toe box is tight on my foot.,86040919
T657N,5,04/19/2017,Perfect for running on pavement I ordered these shoes about a month ago and it only took 3 or 4 runs for me to break them in!!! Very durable and comfortable especially for running outside on hard pavement.  Highly recommend for anyone who needs a solid shoe for jogging long distance.,84528422
T657N,4,04/04/2017,Great shoe I usually don't purchase this brand but decided to try the shoe. I wear an 8 wide and this does feel like it runs on the short side. It is very comfortablele as I walk 4 miles a day. I did keep the shoe even though it feels short.,83860108
T657N,3,04/04/2017,"Too narrow.Returned immediately;ordered a new one I have been jogging in Asics for more than a decade. Great shoes. This time I purchased the same size as my old shoes but D size (wide). It was unfortunately too narrow and slightly short. I returned it immediately, but ordered one size longer and wider afterwards. Still like the quality of the jogging shoes a lot. Look forward to the new shoes.",83859767

T657N,5,04/01/2017,"Good for problem feet I've always worn neutral trainers but when I injured my toe the foot doc recommended light stability shoes.  I purchased this pair, ran in them and within a couple of months, the toe pain was gone.  This has good support but still pretty lightweight.  The stability features are not overbearing so it didn't give me any knee trouble.  It runs a bit small though so I recommend sizing up 1/2 size.  The wide still felt a bit snug but does loosen up once you've put some miles in them.  The heel is pretty snug so my feet don't slide out of them while running.  I'm already on my second pair of this very same model which is last years model. I didn't care much for the newest model (GT 2000 5) because the toe box is smaller and shallower than this one.",83711405
T657N,3,03/24/2017,"Great Support But Sizing.... Just came in the mail today.  Color was beautiful!  My last pair of ASICs were a dream--Hurricane model.  I will exchange my size 9, D width for a 9.5 sized shoe.  Surprised because I generally wear an 39/40.  Looking forward to getting my new size.  Will write a new review when I get my new pair.",83268433

A shame, from having a great shoe. Waste of money",92729072
T680N,5,07/10/2017,Excellent shoe I have only used the shoe twice since I received them last week. I have found them to be extremely comfortable and durable for trail running.,89962307
T680N,5,03/15/2017,Really comfortable Being used as turf hockey shoe and performing well,82841415
T680N,1,05/13/2016,Lacking arch support I bought these shoes to run trails with ease. The insert made the overall fit of the shoe feel tight. Then walking around I definitely noticed the lack of arch support. I have normal arches and was surprised by this. This is my 3rd pair of asics and have been satisfied in the past.,65991801
T680N,4,03/30/2016,Lots of good I have worn asics for about 20 years. I think these are my favorite. The base is so sturdy that so far my stability is great. My only criticizing would be the color. For trail the black shows the dust but the comfort makes up for that,64182469
T682N,5,10/19/2016,"Great all round trail shoe After wearing a few pair of the fujiracer this fujilyte is all and better with longer lasting construction of the uppers, and the new sole has better grip.  I love this shoe for its minimal feel, lightweightness yet supports my foot for short distances all the way up to the 50mile race.  Primo on trails and light enough for roads too.",73049102
T682N,1,08/19/2016,Nice look but very uncomfortable. The fabric used is very hard which makes my feet blistered and feel pain. I am a long time Asics customer and marathon runner. I have never had any complaints about any of my previous purchases from Asics however I am very disappointed with this one.,70161481
T690N,5,01/30/2017,"Excellent Shoe! Got these after moving to an environment where there simply weren't many road options, but the show must go on.  Ran both on and the off-road(trails), and was pleasantly surprised how the shoe adapted to both terrains.  Even ran in about 4 inches of snow and again, pleasantly surprised!  My feet were kept dry throughout a 10 miler due i suspect to the Plasmaguard tech that was included in this product.",80592025
T691N,5,12/10/2017,"I Love This Shoe The shoe fits comfortably and as expected. The shoe feels like slippers but the support is amazing!  I ran my first distance race after only 2 previous runs and 13 miles after purchase. The tester runs went so well, i felt confident wearing on race day. I was not disappointed. I felt like this shoe performed well at absorbing shock and the pounding. Well worth the price. Happy feet and limbs, equal happy customer!",97967869
T691N,5,09/22/2017,"Love, love love :) I'm so happy that i have bought this trainers, even they are quiet expensive they are worth every penny. Its like walking/running on the clouds. So comfortable and so beautify made as well.",1039296666
T691N,4,09/08/2017,Asics Metarun Collected on 6 9 2017. Didn't need any breaking in. Really comfortable straight away. Great support for my overpronation. Light enough to feel that they are not there. Great for office plodding all day & quick marching on daily commute. Great trainers. Very happy.,1038771582
T691N,5,07/18/2017,"Great support/cushioning! I owned four pairs of asics, none of them could compared to this one...(of course this is the most expensive shoe of all fours)
I started to run 10k so I need a shoe that has light weight/support/cushion all at the same time ( really picky right!) and I am so glad that I bought the metarun cuz it was so comfortable.
I have narrow foot, it fits perfectly!",90549719
T691N,5,06/22/2017,"Dear but high quality This shoe is VERY VERY expensive, but the quality is VERY high, so it is in some ways a toss up. As I walk allot, it has been worth it, but the price is definitely a cringe. That being said, worth ending on the fact that I don't like I've ever had a better running shoe.",1034578820
T691N,4,05/18/2017,"Really smart running trainers I bought these trainers a week ago and have ran in them twice. They are suited for over pronation runners which is why I bought them and they are much more comfier than my previous ascis trainers and a lot more 'bounce' and support from them. The only problem I have found is that the soles of my feet become slightly sore after about 25 mins into my run but this might be because I need to wear them in a bit more and they are more narrower then my old ones. Overall a really nice trainer with a lot of great features, more pricey but I can see why!",1033151068
T691N,2,05/13/2017,"They are just ok Just purchased these a few days ago and they are on their way back to be refunded. It's not that they were awful, I just do not believe they are worth the price tag. For the Costco the trainer  I believe they should have felt la lot more better when I tried them on. Yes, they were comfy to a certain degree but just not what I expected. Size wise I would suggest to buy your exact size, I've never had this brand before and the actual sizing was fine. When you put them on you can feel the sole has lots of padding which is good. 
All in all I wouldn't say don't buy them but I think you can definitely find something similar a bit cheaper elsewear that will do the same job.",1032977799
T691N,5,05/08/2017,"I love these I'm not a natural runner, I have been on the couch to 5 K , as a treat for getting past the 8 week mark , I promised myself to buy some proper running shoes... what a mine field! Which ones do I choose? You can hardly test run them. So I went on runners web site, these came out on top. 
Not only do they look stylish, I can wear these out and about , very subtle sparkle, not day glow in your face . Running  wise, I'm all over the shop, trying to build strength and balance into my 62 year old body, these are supportive, and light. I've got to carry on running now, to do justice to these very fine shoes, who knows where that might lead me.",1032769380
T691N,5,05/05/2017,"Amazing shoes! This my second pair of Metarun shoes; yes, they're expensive but personally I think they're worth every penny. No problems, no blisters, no aching feet, just run straight out of the box; I've not had to 'run in' either pair which is amazing. I have other pairs of running shoes but these will always be my favourites!",1032659837

I am a big fan of Asics, but wanted to review other makes.
So glad I din't change brands",1031175371
T691N,5,04/01/2017,"Perfect Running Shoes This is my second time to buy the Metarun, because I just love them. I run 5 miles everyday, and have tried others brands running shoes, but Asics always fits my feet for long distance running. I used to wear kayano 23 and  quantum 360, but Metarun is the best, not like quantum 360 is too heavy, and has better color than Kayano 23. I also bought a pair for my mother who is 53 years old, and she loves walking with them, they are perfect fitted not only jogging suits but also jeans.
     I have to change my shoes every 3 months, because the heel part inside the shoes always been worn out and have the foam out. I hope Asics can fix this part. Otherwise, this is the best shoes ever! I highly recommend Meta Run to everyone who loves running!",83707680
T691N,1,03/19/2017,Not Happy So uncomfortable. Had them on for 5 minutes and they hurt my feet. I wear Asics to work everyday at the hospital and these were just not good as soon as I put them on. I think the price is just ridiculous also but i was willing to pay the price if they were comfortable.,83015522
T692N,1,12/19/2017,Bought these in Sept. and they are falling apart This is my third pair of Asics.  Love the comfort but they fall apart quickly.  Every pair has fallen apart in the same manor.  They are extremely comfortable.  Just wish they didn't fall apart!,98285825

T692N,5,04/30/2017,My favorite pair yet! I sometimes buy the Kayano which I always love.  This is my second pair of Kinsei and they are my favorite.  Great support yet still on the lighter side.  Asics is the only shoe I trust enough to buy online.  I wear an 11 which leaves me with a small selection in stores.,85908414
T692N,5,04/24/2017,So comfortable I bought these a few weeks ago. I've always ran in Asics but these were the most comfortable by far. I ran a half marathon at weekend In them and they were outstanding.,84731885
T692N,5,04/17/2017,Great Comfortable Shoe!!! Bought this shoe along with a Gel Kayano and this shoe is wonderful comfort! I've suffered with Plantar fasciitis and need a really good shoe to keep my feet from hurting. My plan was to wear these to just work but I find myself wearing them everywhere.,84441884

The colors are so vibrant and the comfort is impeccable. I slipped them on and went out for a jog. There are impressive hills where I live yet my Gel-Kinsei felt equally supportive and comfortable. I will be purchasing more!",81786407
T692N,4,02/19/2017,"Cushion and support! I just bought these 2 weeks ago and have had several runs (5-6 mi) in these and they feel great. I alternate shoes and these will be perfect for my road runs. 
Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are a little roomy in the tie box and I prefer a snug fit. I bought them in an 8 and wish I would have bought 7.5.",81754255

I am 57, and I love the new colors of the ASICS Shoes, unlike other customers.  They are cheerful! I guess you can say they are my Happy Shoes!  Thanks ASICS!",93790783
T694N,5,05/20/2017,Great comfort and ascetically pleasing I bought these shoes about 3 weeks ago and have worn them everyday for running.  The are cushioned and have great heal to toe motion.  The only draw back is the tongue of the shoe keeps moving from side to side.  I have some other Kinsei 5 shoes that had the tongue that was supported on either side.,86657884

T694N,4,02/01/2017,Great shoe but not so great material. I have worn Asics since I became a nurse 5 years ago and the Kinsei are the most comfortable shoe to wear for 12+ hours on your feet. I have bought several Kinsei shoes and this style is the only one that the material did not withhold the first wash.  It is still very comfortable to wear but every time I wash them the material keeps coming apart.  I haven't had these shoes but about a year so I would expect the material to last longer since I have not had any other issues with my other Asics.  Other than that I love my Kinsei shoes!,80667425

T696N,4,12/29/2017,"So narrow I already must go a size up in a standard width to accommodate my wide feet. But for the first time ever, I had to go up a size AND order a D width. Today, however, they felt good on the first day I wore them.",98579727

T696N,5,12/08/2017,Excellent Look and Support I bought this shoe for running only. I typically switch to lighter weight shoes for training and lifting. This is my first Gel Kayano shoe and I love it better than previous Asics shoes. Not too heavy and not too wide and excellent support.

After reading the reviews and with some trepidation I decided to go up a full size larger than the ones I have and I am very glad that I did.  A half size larger may have been ok but I am happy with the way the full size larger fits.    Also, I got the poseidon/silver/cockatoo color and the color is more vibrant than the picture.  Love these!",96020542
T696N,3,10/16/2017,"A narrow fit and took awhile to break in I have been happilty wearing ASICS for many years; however, this Gel-Kayano 23 sneaker is definitely narrower than its predecessors and also very stiff, neither of which I have ever encountered in the past with an ASICS sneaker. I do have a large foot for a woman, size 11, but my feet are definitely not wide.  The stiffness was annoying at first until 'I broke them in' which I have never needed to do in the past.  At times, the sneakers felt so stiff that if I felt like I was swimming upstream, walking was a effort. Despite the negatives,  I still feel my feet are getting superior support with thi s sneaker and ASICS sneakers are the best line of sneakers for my feet.",94383455

Have not found any other shoe that even comes close in comfort.  Used to run, now I hike, plus my feet and my body is happy throughout every day.  Neutral enough color, used grey laces for foreign travel.  Outstanding shoes when it comes to comfort and support.  Am a total fan of Asics Gel Kayano, narrow width!",86328825

I read all the online reviews, which advised to order a bigger size in the Gel-Kayano 23, due to the narrow toebox.  I ordered a half size bigger, which was too big and did not work for me.

I've been running pretty much all my life and have worn many different brands of shoes and I have to say that the ASICS GT-1000 5 running shoes are high up on my list for the current best bang for your buck running shoes.

However, I purchased the Kayanos 23 as I am running a marathon in 6 weeks and I was told that these are the absolute best.

T6A5N,1,07/08/2017,DO NOT FIT WELL I have worn the GEL Kayano for years and this shoe is not comfortable. My feet hurt after a few hours at work.

The Good news is they've now released the Kayano 24 - which is supposed to be more like the Kayno 21. Sent these back and ordered the 24.",88061092
T6A5N,1,05/31/2017,"Different fit than previous Kayanos I have been wearing Kayanos for years. I've had 2 pairs of the 20s, 2 pairs of the 21s, 4 pairs of the 22s, and now I have this pair of the 23s (all in a 7.5). I have always loved Kayanos since they are comfortable and supportive, but this pair doesn't fit well. It's awkwardly narrow and then so loose on my heel. 
I tried to fix my heel slippage by lacing my shoes differently, but they still slip. I've never had this issue or had to lace lock before. I'm extremely disappointed since this new pair was so expensive and such poor quality. The materials have changed, too (not in a good way). I'm going to get an older model of Kayanos for now, but I'm going to switch models in the future.",87448618

I am a RN and so I am on my feet 12+ hours a day, after the first week I was ready to throw them away they felt tight across the toes, they killed my feet.  I have planter Fascitis and usually Asics are my go to shoe for comfort.  I changed out the insole and they are better, but I feel they don't let my feet breath by the end of the day my feet are hot.  Maybe next time I will go up a 1/2 size.  I normally wear a 9 in all of Asics.  I feel for what these cost they should have been more comfortable than my usual Gel Flux that I normally wear.",86874866

T6A6N,3,11/13/2017,"Not as good as previous model I've been wearing these for a couple of weeks now. I only use them for walking to and from work, a total of 2 miles a day. I wouldn't want to wear these while running (I'm not a runner, so they won't be tested). I felt that the GEL-Kayano 22 fit better in the toe-box. The 23 has a bit too much room for my taste, but will easily fit the thick winter socks I'm soon going to have to wear. It's really the arch support that's bumming me out. I pronate a good deal, and I don't feel that these shoes prevent me from doing that as well as the 22. The black color is definitely sharp. I don't feel awkward if I don't change my shoes as soon as I get to work.",97004219
T6A6N,5,10/28/2017,"Comfortable and stable Arrived 3 weeks ago and I recently tore my plantar fascia and was told by my podiatrist these were best for my issue.

T6A6N,5,10/07/2017,Great Shoe I walk anywhere from 4 to 8 miles a day and I love walking in Asics. This shoe keeps my foot extremely stable as I have a problem with over pronation.  So far this shoe is the best of the lot.,94014002
T6A6N,5,09/16/2017,Great Running Shoe! I have been getting the GEL-Kayano shoe for the past 8 years. I have always had ankle instabilities due to previous soccer injuries. This shoe has been one of the few that have helped decrease the impact running has on my ankles.,93293208
T6A6N,1,09/08/2017,Not worth the money I have worn Asics for many years and am very disappointed in this shoe. It is not nearly as comfortable as my Asics have been in the past and even gave me blisters when wearing them while running. Definitely will not be purchasing these again!,93053002
T6A6N,5,07/02/2017,"Most comfortable running shoe ever! Bought these 5 months ago the day before the Women's March on Washington. Kept my feet so happy all day standing/walking.

Worth every penny!",89587504
T6A6N,5,05/22/2017, Had these shoes for about two weeks now and I must say it was a great purchase! Only thing is that they were a little narrower at the tips than I am use to but I think they will just take a little extra time to get broken into.,86841132

T6A8N,3,11/13/2017,"Some caveats I ordered one pair of GT-1000 5 but two pair arrived. Customer service sent me a return label so I paid no shipping for the return. However, I think the website may need a tune-up to prevent this type of error. I've run in the sneakers once. I would prefer a bit more arch support, as I had with Asics' 2150s. Time will tell if they wear as well as my old favorites.",97026203

T6A8N,5,10/08/2017,"Great fit! I bought these online and was quite happy that they fit perfectly! Also love that they have black soles so that when wearing long pants they fit in with dressy casual. I used to run and have been a fan of Asics for many years especially since the Asics hug my feet. I ran a marathon several years ago with my Asics and I didn't have any sore feet later.  I have many activities , walking, Jazzercise, Zumba, and and these 
shoes are perfect.  I also tend to pronate a litte as well as have a high arch and the design of the shoe with the bands on the side help to snug in my foot. I am a happy customer!",94025912

T6C3N,4,12/10/2017,"Sizing? Bought 4 pair Cumulous 18 since Octoberish. 2 sz 9.5 for me and 2 10's for son. First pairs (10 & 9.5) fit as expected. Last order my 9.5 is a smidge smaller. For me, acceptable. Tried sons 10 (Christmas gift) on and almost seemed smaller than my 9.5. As he won't be trying on before Christmas, a bit worried. Time will tell. 6th pair for him and 2 for me. We love the shoes! If his fit, will be 5 star.",97982652
T6C3N,5,12/10/2017,Another Great Cumulus But They Do Run Small I concur with most of the reviews.  If you run in Asics order a half size bigger than what you normally wear.  Trust the reviews.  They will be tight in the toe if you don't.  I had to send them back and get a half size larger and now they fit and feel great....just like my other pairs.,97970990
T6C8N,3,12/28/2017,Did the size get small with new style? Have ordered these shoes (Cumulus size 9.5) for my mother for over 7 years. This most recent pair is shorter and also tighter around the front of the foot....like the shoes are made smaller. She's discarded the box so I can't return them. Next time I'll get a size 10 to see if that fits better. Disappointed with the inconsistency in sizing. Hassle having to send them back.,98545869

It’s a great fitting shoe however I found the toe box a little snug compared to my other Asics and not as cushioned but I think it’s more of a personal preference. It’s still a great shoe but the toe box is quite snug.",98395382

The entire structure is different and the inserts are thicker than previously, so that the shoe feels way too tight, even though it is the right size.  The front end is not as well designed, so that it is too soft. Please bring back the Cumulus 17!",97961240

T6C9N,5,10/12/2017,"Pain no more! Some construction considerations.. Ive been wearing these shoes all summer(worn about 4 months or more) as a result of my regular footwear leaving me in so much pain at the end of the day. Not anymore! I love the fit of these shoes and they seem to be helping with my supination issue. I can wear them all day and I my feet are no longer aching! My only suggestions to the company are to find an alternative to the mesh they use at the top of the toes. I got a hole in one from wear and tear and tried sewing it but it just gave out right beside the hole. That material just isnt strong enough. 2. Even the D width isnt as wide as it should have been for a wide shoe, lucky it didnt cause any issues. Lastly I would love for the colours of the shoe to be darker especially the sole, the material it is made from picks up so much dirt and its so obvious, and with how soft the mesh is its hard to clean otherwise the mesh will fray. Thanks, I really want to buy these shoes again but I wish those changes could be made. Even if the company could make a variety of types of shoes (like hikers or maryjanes) but using the same sole/bottom construction, thatd be amazing. Otherwise I may have to consider costly orthotic inserts or shoes for the winter.",94286427
T6C9N,5,09/30/2017,"Great Shoes Bought these for my daughter's 46th birthday !  We have both worn Asics for about 7 months exclusively.

T6C9N,3,05/01/2017,Older versions are better. Color is great though! I have bought the other versions of the Cumulus in wide width and I never had a problem with them. This one seems to run small not just in size but in width as well. The toe box is very narrow and by the end of the day my feet feel exhausted. I have always loved Asics but their quality of shoes lately has not been good.,85923782
T6C9N,4,04/24/2017,"Wide Widths I replace my Asics about every 4 months. My true shoe size is a 10. This spring I have had a really hard time with the wide width styles. Many times I move up a half size, but this time I had to move up an entire size to not have the pressure on my toes. This required trying several different styles before settling on this style, a size bigger than my last pair. Overall I am happy with Asics and find that they are the best if you have problem feet. It just seems that their wide widths aren't wide anymore which, for me, has created a problem being fitted.",84731146
T6C9N,5,04/19/2017,Really comfortable shoes! Bought online after local store did not have my size. Arrived quickly. Very cushioned but think I should have gotten either half size longer or extra wide. Could use just a smidgeon more toe room. Otherwise perfect!,84507965
T6C9N,5,04/18/2017,"Happiest with the larger size I am very happy with the Cumulus. Returned the original pair due to the sizing being smaller than previous Cumulus I've bought.

I have been wearing this shoe in the Michigan winter and my feet have stayed dry.

T6F3Y,5,12/17/2017," I was introduced to the dynaflyte about 1 year ago. You don't truly know how running shoes are going to perform until you get them out on the road. They perform superb.  Lightweight, comfortable and the color schemes are attractive.  The only draw back is i think they wear out a little quicker than i would like.  Im not that avid Of a runner and i bought 3 pairs just in case they become hard to find. Still a  good option.",98203743

T6F8Y,1,10/24/2017,I wanted to like them This model runs small. They were too short.  I had to send back to get a half size bigger. I also didn’t like the colors.  A little too much for me. Even brighter in person. The shoes felt stiff.  I had kayanos before so comparing to those the dynaflytes are definitely less cushiony.  I didn’t think they’d be comfortable enough for all day wear or running. These were listed as one of the best too. I ended up sending back the second pair I ordered too. The bigger size didn’t make them anymore comfortable and the other color I chose was too much as well.,94644913

And I have had all brands and kinds of running shoes in my days, even other Asics but these are the winners by far. They look good on the foot and feel like a cloud literally. And they are lightweight!! You won't regret the purchase! The shoes aren't stiff but they do have a nice base because they are made for stability. I just got them so I'm not sure about the durability. There is not one thing I dislike about the shoe.

T6K2N,1,06/20/2017,"Asics Trail Runner Fatal Flaw strikes again To Asics corporate executives: You have a fatal flaw in the design of the Trail Runners treads. I've owned 2 pairs of Gel Ventures, both of which fell apart in the exact same spot (1 after just a few days), and now 1 pair of Gel-Scram 3 which is coming apart also in the exact same spot, after 1 month.

The Gel-Scram 3 is light and comfortable. It fits very well and has good cushion.
However, it suffers from the same tread flaw that I've found in every single pair of Asics trail runners - the 'outer sole' or 'double-tread' construction is built in 2 pieces which will inevitably separate. The glue simply will not hold. I've owned this pair for exactly 1 month and the tread is already failing.

Tread-life of 1 month is simply unacceptable.",88898763

They are extremely comfortable, just as my first pair still are. The only difference is, the GEL-S3 feels wider in the upper portion of the shoe/mid-foot and up around the toes; the entire shoe looks larger and feels a bit more roomy on my foot but it's still very comfortable and lightweight.

T6K7N,5,07/16/2017,"Great Shoes I bought these shoes a month ago and wanted to update my review.  They were so comfortable brand new out of the box.  I had no Idea that I was going to love them even more a month later.  I have a high instep, need a slightly wider width at the front of the foot and taller toe box.  My heel is standard width. I have good arches usually shoes dont have enough arch for me.  I also like a very flexible shoe with a neutral aspect.  With all that baggage hanging over it this shoe performed like a champion right out of the box. I was on my feet 12 hour days, in hilly gardens on a bus tour, and I was waiting for break in pain that never came. The support under the ankle is great and dosnt chafe. Im here on the website getting another pair before they change!  All this and they are cute and well made too.",90504474

T6L0N,5,10/25/2017,Excellent Support! Cured My Plantar Fasciitis My new found friends for my feet! I've used Nimbus and Kayano for years. I has switched the last few pairs to Kayano for my over pronation and flat feet. I always used them over theses for more cushioning from the extra gel. Well a couple of weeks ago I developed Plantar Fasciitis which is terribly painful to say the least. My podiatrist (who wears asics too) gave me some insoles to wear bu they made it worse. I went to try and get some shoes with better support as my Kayano's were getting old. When I got to the store I tried both on while still in pain of the PF. These fit me better and gave me better support and they forced me to walk better using the  full foot instead of most of my weight being on the inside of my feet. My PF problem isn't technically cured yet but it got better immediately. I had relief within an hour of putting these on and it has gotten better daily since. I tried the Kayanos for 30 min again the other day to see if it was just me healing and not the shoe and the problem started coming back so I quickly took them off as I never want to go through that again!!!!,94673155

My feet are thin, bony, and long with a mild over pronation.  OMG I love these shoes.  They run narrow which is what drew me to them in the first place  because size 11 shoes are normally way too wide for me.  These are perfect. I had absolutely no pressure points on my feet, no sensations in my hips, knees or ankles.  I rate them the best I have tried yet.  I don't know about durability yet since I just got them, so may have to do an update later.  Currently training for half marathon using my ranch as the training venue.",98090958

I bought the nimbus 19 and as my training distances increased I found they were getting more and more uncomfortable. After reaching about 10km in a run I just found them too painful to wear. i was up to  at 15kms in my training runs and it was killing me. I had to get advice and ended up changing to brookes gts 17's. I didnt want to change so close to a race but i had to do something. So now i am hooked on my pair of brookes.

Finally, the 19s are worse than the 18s because they made the toe box way too small.  Did they change the last?  Did the factory screw up?

Sorry to say, but after decades of running in ASICS I need to find a different manufacturer.

T702N,3,11/04/2017,Favorite Shoe has Changed The Nimbus line has been my go to shoes for the past few years. Plantar fasciitis has been a problem and these have provided relief.

I am coming back from an injury so I was doing very low mileage at a slow pace and enjoying the extra stability, but after only a couple of months my toes started to break through the mesh. They fit great and my toes even had extra wiggle room, so it wasn't from them being too tight, it was simply that the material wasn't strong enough. I am returning these and will be looking elsewhere for my next shoe.",95817263
T705N,4,10/13/2017,Great structural support I bought these last month and i’m very happy with them. Asics changed some features like the mesh which I liked. However they do run small so I would recommend going a half size or a full size.,94306715
T705N,1,08/30/2017,"A total disappointment I waited for the release of the 3000-5 with great anticipation and disregarded the one prior review thinking it could not be true.  My worst ever experience with this line which I have been wearing for over 20 years, starting with the Gel 1920.  Just back from my first run - a simple 6 miles on asphalt trail.  After 3 miles I've got a hot spot on my right big toe, after 5 miles the ball on my left foot is numb!  I have probably had more than 50 pairs of this line and never, ever had a blister.  That streak stopped today.  The heel is solid with good support and cushioning.  The cushioning at the ball of the foot is inadequate.  The seams are poorly sewn.  The sole is a full 1/4 inch narrower at the ball of the foot - not a huge problem, however I prefer the wider ride of the 3000-4.  Now what to do - the 2000 series was very disappointing when they went from the 2070 to the 2000-1.  Definitely need to try something different.  The 3000-5 is a bust.",92793343

Although these are for neutral arches, I find them great to switch with my Asics Nimbus 19s or Cumulus 19s. If I wear the same shoe day after day my knees let me know it is time to switch. The GT-200-5s are great. I have purchased an extra 3 pairs of all 3 Asics styles ahead because my greatest fear is that when they change these styles, they won't work for my knees and daily walks. I buy the men's versions as I believe they will last longer. Once any shoe starts to wear down on the outer edge, my back and knees let me know it is time to change to a new pair.

T707N,4,09/29/2017,"Dry quicker I bought the GT2000-5's to replace the 4's. So far mileage wear seems in course with the 4's I had been running in (I have two active pairs of shoes to alternate my running as part of my marathon training)--I received around 370 miles per pair before my overpronation wear pattern started to hurt my knees. As far as comparing the 5 model to the 4 I like the new design of the shoe interior as it seems to fit more snug than the 4's and the material dries faster. However, the 5's seem to not have as much absorption, shock wise, as the 4's did. Thus far I'm through about 1/3 of the anticipated miles on the two new pairs and the spring just isn't there so I don't think it has anything to do with breaking the new shoes in. The toe box is relatively the same as the older model as well. The tongue is shorter, but I feel it also fits tighter to keep unwanted stones out which is a plus! Overall I'm pleased and will likely keep with the GT2000 series for next year's training as well.",93690391

I have run in the GT-2000 or its predecessors for a very long time (decades...) and the shoe simply no longer fits.  Please go back to the earlier designs.

GT2000 has good support, structure, cushioning, stronger/wider sole, and muted neutral gray colors that don’t show dirt after trails (important often overlooked design element for sneakers). The Innersole/Sockliner on inside heel is good for not absorbing moisture, HOWEVER this material is incredibly weak! It started tearing after just 2 months and now after 4 months is totally shredded. Please fix this part of the design for the next generation, I would love to stick with this shoe but need a performance shoe that can take a beating.",93240335

T712N,2,04/10/2017,"GT-2000 5 Trail Bought these shoes from ASICs online for trail use and rucking. I wore them around the house for three days before using them on a trail. The first downhill section confirmed my suspicions. These size 10 were a bit small because my big toes were pushing against the front of the shoe. Should have taken some reviewers advice and bought a half size larger. All the shoes I buy, from dress, running and hiking boots are size 10 with plenty of room for my toes. Try these shoes on in a store before buying. It's the only way I would recommend a purchase. I have read similar sizing complaints about other ASIC shoes. Did they go too far in trying to shave grams off the shoe's weight?",84161709
T712N,5,04/05/2017,GREAT trail shoe I just did a trail run in these and they are fabulous.  No zero zilch nada foot issues and great traction on less than ideal terrain.  If you are a big individual who needs good stability in a shoe look at these.

Wear these with casual clothes and will get a 2nd pair (lt gray and orange) to compliment when I wear darker clothes.  Durable and will keep as seasonal, until I have need for another similar pair.  Fit is good and not too sophisticated on the lacing which gives a balance top-to-bottom. Ran on these on grass and dirt-sandy paths and do the job without any slippage or sliding.

Stocked up on the 19 thru 21's and still have about 5 pairs. Tried the 24's on recently and they fixed the toe fit! Purchased a pair and ran in them for a week and they fit great. I do see two issues that hopefully Asics will rectify next year. First, there isn't as much gel in the sole as the previous models so it runs stiffer, quite noticeable when hitting the ground. Also, I find it a little looser in the heel although it stays on okay. I do use an insert in my running shoes which may impact this. Even with those minor things I was quite comfortable after a week of running with the 24's and plan on purchasing another. Thanks Asic's for listening!",97353089

T750N,5,12/15/2017,Good product These shoes are so comfortable. The only thing I would like to change is the color. I didn't pay close attention to the color and thot they would be a darker black. I always recommend Asics to others!,98147960
T750N,4,12/14/2017,"Good comfort and support, very narrow I’ve been wearing these since the 15 version. They were wider back then. Then then started getting narrower which was nice for me. The 18 was a PERFECT fit. With these ones now they are very narrow and I have narrow feet! They work as long as I wear my thinner pairs of running socks. Good shoe still, just too narrow. I see why people are complaining.",98113985

T750N,5,12/12/2017, Best shoes I've purchased. It's very hard to find a good pair of running shoes for me due to so many problems with my feet and I can say these shoes are by far the most comfortable pair I've purchased! Very well worth it!,98056789

T750N,5,12/07/2017, First.  Thank you so much for posting about the sizing issues!  I normally am a size 9 standard.  I ordered a size 10 Wide size D.  They fit snug but like my past shoes did.  Yes.  They run small.  Thanks again for all of you that posted!  I listened.  I have a good fit.,97885059
T750N,5,12/06/2017,great fit i was apprehensive to buy this version of Nibus due to all the negative reviews but for me the new snug fit works even better.  Its definitely tighter in width and length in the forefoot and toe box. The cushioning is great as always for Nimbus shoe.,97872029
T750N,4,12/02/2017,"Nimbus 19 Review I like the fit a lot. However, I feel as if the support is not exactly the same as the previous model. It seems as if the the cushioning under my foot is different. Not sure if the materials are different and as a result the nice support I use to get is not the same. I really like the design and color schemes. I have both the black and one of the blue versions. Thanks",97723606

T751N,2,12/03/2017,So sad ASICS has been my go to for years. It’s so sad. That the toe bed has changed and is too narrow. Now I have to find a new sneKer,97733437
T751N,3,12/02/2017,"Disappointed with Nimbus 19 Very disappointed with how they changed up the Nimbus 19 compared to the previous Nimbus shoes. From the reviews, I was warned to get a 1/2 size larger. Boy were they right. The toe area is drastically tighter. I had to return them and get them in a wide. I'm still not completely happy with them. And this was a shoe that was always true to size. Not now. Thinking about going up a whole size and re-ordering. The Asics GEL Nimbus shoes used to be the one clothing item I could walk into a store, buy and walk out 5 mins later and be100% happy with how they fit. Now that's changed. Go back to the previous fit!! 

On a positive note, their shipping is very fast. Now to see how smooth the refund is on my first pair.",97712403
T751N,4,11/30/2017,Love ASICS I’ve been wearing ASICS for the past 8-10 years. I do have to get them in wide width as they seem to run narrow. I have a bit of an issue because the ball of my foot is wide but my heel is narrow. I get some slippage from this but it’s bearable. Wish someone could develop an adjustable shoe!,97633792

T757N,4,12/29/2017,Love them but..... The support is amazing! Im an amputee and wish they had just a bit more cushiony softness. I need a bit more walking in a cloud feel but I won’t wear anything else.,98566647
T757N,5,12/29/2017,"Excellent comfort and support! I normally purchase the Kayano style but decided to take a chance on these after reading other reviews. So glad I did! Please be aware you have to size up 1/2 a size. I wear a 10M and ordered these in 10.5 based on other reviews. 

I'm recovering from severe plantar fasciitis and a fractured heel spur. The GT-2000 5 have great support and have been super comfortable right out of the box with no break in time needed. They fit perfectly and even my orthotics fit with no issue. Really happy with this shoe.",98558232

T757N,4,12/15/2017,"Support is good! But short in the toe I should have believed the other reviews. But yes it is true! The toe space is just a bit shorter than other past series.  My foot always fit just right in the same size for YEARS, but this time I find my toes squeezed and touching the front and actually my nail polish rubs off on my big toe from rubbing.  I did keep them for general use, but did have to guy another pair for running.",98141815

I hate it when I find something I like and then the manufacturer tries to improve on it - or worse - they stop making it.  I hope Asics keeps making this shoe just the way it is.
Btw - I was a little worried the color would be too ""out there"" but I LOVE it!!",97963502

T762N,3,11/13/2017,"Missed the mark on this model I’ve been wearing the GT 2000 series for over 10 years and the thing I loved best about this shoe was that they may tweak a few components here and there, but the overall
shoe and construction of the shoe remain the same. This version missed the mark as far as I’m concerned. The shoe is supportive and does control for slight overpronation, but the cushioning in the forefoot is lacking. It also “feels” less supportive or maybe it allows for more movement in the toe box...I haven’t been able to decipher.  Additionally, and probably my biggest complaint are with the laces. They are slick and it’s almost impossible to tie them tight enough to stayed tied and yet NOT cut off the circulation in your foot. (I just ran a 10k road race and had to stop three times to tie my laces!  To help, I finally had to tie knots in the ends of the laces to keep them from coming untied, although they did loosen throughout the race.).",97005228
T762N,5,10/21/2017,"So happy, other reviews not accurate. I bought these shoes hoping reviews were wrong and they were. These shoes are equivalent to the gel Nimbus 16... those who are disappointed that the Nimbus don’t feel a thing like model # 16... give these a try. They are a little stiff at first but the cushion is there and you are bouncing off clouds. Perfect for over pronation individuals. I hardly write reviews but being that I’ve been so uncomfortable for a while trying she after shoe, I felt compelled to actually write a review. I can’t wait to go hiking this fall in these. I know I will not have any problems. I will be able to move around like it’s nothing again. I don’t get tired for at least 12 hours while wearing these. I have flat feel and these are perfect. Right out of the box I felt better. Thank you to all other reviewers, but you were off on your thoughts of this shoe. I will say that I am a 9 medium, and I did order a 9.5, and they were perfect.",94530662
T762N,4,09/16/2017,"Great shoe; wore out quickly. I bought these shoes in Feb and by August needed a new pair. As a personal trainer and an athlete, I'm on my feet a lot and it's not uncommon for me to wear shoes out quickly. With that being said, the heel of this shoe did not seem to have much padding and actual holes formed by early August. The shoe was comfortable, true to size and supportive while it lasted and for that I give it 4 stars.",93293056
T762N,5,08/16/2017,"Very Comfortable I bought this model in anticipation of back country hiking in Glacier National Park. I was carrying a 15 lb pack, so didn't need heavy hiking shoes. I wanted s sole that held on uneven ground and some snow pack. They were recommended by the clerk at a running shoe store in Seattle. These worked great. Comfortable and sturdy; lightweight.  I normally wear a size 8.  I bought a 9 1/2 in this shoe, and wore a medium weight hiking sock. It was perfect. My hiking partner had sore toes from her heavy hiking boots, and in the evening insisted on wearing my Asics, as I had brought other shoes along. She wears a 8 1/2, and found the 9 1/2 comfortable.",92106166

T762N,4,05/17/2017,"Good shoe I purchased these almost a month ago and really like the cushion and support.  I went from a pair that was 8 months old and it was like putting on a pair of comfortable slippers with tons of cushion for my knees.  Thank you for coming out with the gray and black.  I have accepted that I am going to be a 10 in this shoe, when in all others I am a 9 1/2.  It does run smaller.  It would be nice if you would open up the toe box a bit at some point as well.",86575937

T762N,3,01/24/2017,I wanted to love this shoe... When I tried this shoe it was sos comfortable. I fell in love. The first day I wore them on a trail I got blisters on the bottoms of each foot. I let it slide and even thought it would be my socks. I wore them 3 more times after that and got blisters each time. I was so sad because the shoes are so comfortable.

T764N,4,09/18/2017,"Confusion about overpronation support I tried these on in store and liked the feel, the support under the arch.  I found this chart on your website that says they are for severe overpronation (like the Gel Foundation), however in three different stores, the sale-persons said that the Gel Flux was NOT for overpronators.  One said that it had ""less support than the Gel Cumulus"".  I ended up not buying them because of lack of availability of the colour I want (all black, for work), but I was considering them for my next purchase for exercise purposes.

Due to severe supination in one foot, I end up with ankle and outer leg pain after walking too far...I usually walk 3-4 miles several times a week. These have a higher support area by the outer ankle that has been very helpful in keeping my ankle from rolling out and I have been able to walk pain free since wearing these.

I still wear them, but insert gel insoles to make them a comfortable work shoe. I work in a clinic setting as well as work as a personal trainer, so I am on my feet all day every day.

I have plantar fasciitis so I got this style to wear inside the house.  Love them! Sturdy sole without the bulk. Perfect for indoors.  Easy to take out the insole and put in your own too.

T770N,4,09/28/2017,"Light shoe, small toe box - needs more cushioning I bought this shoe to train for the Chicago Marathon. It's a light shoe (6.6 ounces compared to the 8.9 Gel Foundation I've worn for 20 years). The lightness is great for about 5-6 miles; after that, the bottom of my feet hurt without the additional cushioning. Cushioning socks help a lot, but the smaller toe box on the shoe creates issues as the mileage increases. Great light running shoe for 4-5 mile runs, but not enough cushioning for longer runs, especially for those doing long races like a half of full marathon.",93655553
T770N,1,06/07/2017,"My Review for GEL-DS Trainer 22 I purchased these shoes in March 2017.  This is my second pair and although I like the performance of the shoe, the quality control is terrible.  Shoelaces are two inches shorter so that they were unable to tie up the shoe adequately.  Also the tongue is doubled over on both sides making increased bulk on the top of the forefoot, i.e., a lot of discomfort.  I suggest that Asics improve their quality control and then they'll have a very good product.  On my previous pair the interior (sock portion) wore out immediately.  This was a first for me.  I'm really light on my shoe gear.",87888695

My doctor recommended Asics as one of the brands to wear, but I really did not look forward to the neon-unicorn-space princess colors that they traditionally come in.    Apparently, I am not the only one because when I went to a running shoe store and selected the white and silver color, they were all sold out.  I was happy to find that Asics.com carried them.

T788N,4,05/02/2017,"Nice, but narrow Nice shoe, but it is definitely narrow in the toe box. I read reviews on several sites, and many folks warned about the narrowness of this shoe in the toe box; they weren't wrong! I have an average width foot, and rarely have a problem with shoes being too narrow, but these were a bit snug. Per advice from other reviewers, I went ahead and ordered a half size larger than I wear because of the toe box narrowness. Though the shoe is a bit too long for me, I can wear thick enough socks to make them work. To help with the narrowness problem, I put a pair of my husband's dress shoe trees in the shoes overnight, and that seemed to help stretch out the toe box enough to make them wearable. All of that said about the toe box, I do like the shoes. I have plantar fasciitis, so I removed the insoles that come with the shoe, and put in my own insoles. The shoes fit well, and provide plenty of arch support with my insoles in them. I also like that Asics offered these shoes in all white. While I appreciate the neat color schemes, I tend to stick with basic black or white, so I was happy to have that option.",85965569

I am really trying to get them broken in and I am still hoping I will like them eventually, but right now they feel like I am running on bricks.  They are hard.  One thing I liked in video descriptions of how they are made is that the heel had a better grip.  That also was a letdown.  I always lace my shoes for better heel grip as I have a narrow heel, but these are no different than other shoes.  The arch support seems spot-on.  That is a definite positive.

Had to return the shoes and went with another brand.  Asics messed up by not only changing the mechanics of the Kayano 20 but also not offering a variety of colors in the wide width.

The top of the toebox feels softer and more open and the front forefoot feels slightly lower or flatter which is more a natural feel for me dont know if thats a good thing though lol The extra width in the 4E is true to fit and no more asics label squashing the outside of my foot.

Downside is I wish they had the metal eyelets like the Nimbus as I have 4 pairs of Kayanos and the inside material starts to fray away and the material comes off and I end up either putting glue inside or tape to fix it.

Please do in a BLACK version in 4E so hard to find anything that is just black. eg for work. I would recommend to everyone and bought my sister a pair in the Phantom Black and she says she will never go back. Converted her to Asics and she is here to stay. Welcome to the Asics Clan lol",89697341

T7A3N,5,11/18/2017,Comfortable and Light! These shoes are surprisingly comfortable and supportive considering how light they are. These shoes are the most comfortable that I have owned so far.,97257040

T7A3N,5,10/10/2017,Very comfortable I bought this shoe 3 weeks ago and the fit and support are excellent. I recently had ankle Sutherland and the support is critical for me to continue to run. This shoe meets that requirement in spades. Thanks Asics!!!,94174740
T7A3N,5,08/30/2017,Great shoes I bought these shoes a week ago and they are very nice. With my plantar fasciitis I can wear these shoes and do my cardio and regular exercise on concrete with no foot pain afterwards. These shoes even better than ft-2000.,92805151

Only complaint is the sizes seem to be a little smaller.  Bought size nine shoes four years ago, went to 9 1/2 last year and should have ordered size 10.",97571970
T7A4N,5,11/28/2017, I have been using the GT-1000s for a while and I was very disappointed with the GT-1000 5s. They did not hold up as long and were not nearly as comfortable as previous versions. I thought I would give the GT-1000 6s a try before I looked elsewhere. I have been totally surprised by them! They are far more comfortable than any of the other previous models and seem to be holding up great. I highly recommend the GT-1000 6s if you are looking for a fairly light stability shoe.,97540098
T7A4N,5,10/31/2017, Great comfortable shoes. They have a nice fit to your feet and can be worn casually and for sports. I absolutely love them!,95781348
T7A5N,2,12/15/2017,"Not For Wide Feet Asics used to be my go-to shoe. With this last pair I'm convinced that they have lost sight of what the term ""wide"" actually means. These shoes were unbearably tight in the toe box area. I will be moving on to other brands.",98163096
T7A5N,1,10/03/2017,"Asics Kayano 24 is NOT Kayano 22 Speaking on behalf of myself and my friend who is an leg ampute, this Kayano 24 is a sad and significant departure from the Kayano 22 that has excellent ankle and foot support and highly superior on comfort. The Kayanon 24 is highly disappointing and I returned.  Asics did fix the sizing issue with the  Kayano 23 that was running at least a half size smaller than the Kayano 22.  I bought four pairs of Kayano 22 recently and love them.  I hope Asics realizes they have a well rounded market of customers and should have kept the model of the Asics Kayano 22 and the new Asics Kayano 24.  We both returned our Kayano 24s.",93808218
T7A5N,5,09/10/2017,No more plantar fasciitis pain! I LOVE these shoes!!!  I no longer have to wear my custom made orthotics in my workout shoes because the support in these is actually better and more comfortable. Great support for both my bunion problem and plantar fasciitis. Well worth the money.,93108322

I tried them on without any socks, got distracted by someone at the door and totally forgot I had the shoes on for over an hour.  Those high heel back areas and rough friction material on most other running shoes give me horrible blisters, but not these.  I had absolutely no irritation what-so-ever!!! And with lite socks on a 5 mile walk, what a joy.  The comfort of these shoes all the way around is unbelievable especially for my 9D foot....",88946641

The customer service rep was very helpful and suggested I try on the 24 bc of its redesigned fit. She even sent me a link to where I could find the shoe for trying on and a link to the different color options. I didn’t love the colors like I did of my #23 pair but found a suitable pair. The rep was correct, there’s was definitely more toe room and I’m finding these pretty comfortable to run in. Thanks for your help ASICS customer support.",97376916

The 4E's used to be so comfortable. I have been wearing only Asics since early 1990's. I truly believe the 4E's are being made narrower. As my last pair( bought over a year and a half ago) is wearing out, I may have to search for a new brand.",94605285

T7B3N,4,12/09/2017,"A bit tight, but feels good running I've had the Cumulus 15's and the 17's and now the 19's.  The first two sets have been the longest lasting running shoes I've used - lasting much longer than the Nimbus's (the 16's) that I have.  The 15's and 17's, and my Nimbus 16's all fit the exact same (though the Nimbus's started out a bit more cushiony).  The Cumulus 19's are much tighter, both in the toe box and around the back of the foot.  I was worried when I first tried them on given the tightness, as when I just have them on they don't quite feel right.  Running in them however was great.  At least on the first run, Asics seems to have maintained the same overall run feel as the previous versions.  I'll see if these last as long, but I'm happy with how that first run went.",97943966
T7B5N,4,11/08/2017,"Good shoe, but early hole in fabric I've bought Asics for years because they fit the ball of my foot well and my orthotics fit well in them.  I came to the web site to try to find a pair that wasn't full of neon colors (Asics, this shoe with a black sole would have been perfect).  My only disappointment is that I've had them three weeks and already there's a hole where my left heel has rubbed through.  This isn't normal, though, usually it takes me a few months for the hole to form.  Apart from this, though, they're the same shoes I look for whenever the old pair is worn out.",96871191

I tried a few other brands and, after spending a lot of money, came back to Asics.  I am glad I did.  After several months off from a hip injury, I am preparing to run my first half marathon.  I feel like they could have more cushioning.  I had to add an insert, but it was an inexpensive, easy fix.",94151414

I purchased wide so I would have more room in toe box - I do have wide feet. Other brands tend to pinch.  Only downfall, wide was only offered in the gray. I feel there should be more choices.

I am 57, over weight and I walk a couple miles every day mostly on black top. These shoes are like walking on a thick carpet, awesome cushioning, just the right amount of arch support and I like the stability they have it gives me great balance. I also like the mesh upper shoe it give lots of room for your toes and it lets your feet breath. I love these shoes and would definitely recommend them......",92293114

Be sure to try it before you buy it.  Kind of like the 14 or 15 (can't remember which) that was also a bad year.  No longer my go to running shoe.

T7C3N,1,12/06/2017,Not true to fit The Asics Gel Nimbus has been my go to choice for running shoes for over a decade. However this version they made too small! It is not true to size so if you're going to go with it go up a whole size. Foot box is too narrow and I have narrow feet! And whole shoe is too short.,97866310
T7C3N,4,11/27/2017,"Solid pair of ""winter trainers"" I had the Nimbus 18 Lite-Show last year, and these feel similar. Plenty of cushion, and not too heavy. These shoes definitely aren't lightweight, but they are good for high-mileage training cycles such as ""winter base building."" The reflective elements aid a bit with peace of mind on dark evening runs. The laces are slightly elastic which feels luxurious in a way and the insole/inner portions are very smooth. I am about 50 miles into this pair and I foresee putting 500+ miles on them easily.",97523283

T7C4N,4,09/30/2017,Great Shoe for this aged out speed demon I used to put 2 or 3 thousand miles a year on my running shoes...now I just wear them to walk and enjoy the weekend.

T7C8N,4,12/11/2017,"Size up! Love these shoes but you definitely need to size up if not a half size maybe even a whole size. I typically wear a 7.5 in most other shoes and knew to order an 8 in these but they were so tight across my toes my feet were numb. I had plenty of room length wise so I was hesitant to order a whole size larger but all the cushioning in the back provides enough support that the shoe does not slip. I have a very narrow foot and would say this may not be the right shoe for you if your foot is on the wider side. Great shoe overall, just be patient and get the right fit!",98028405

in those also but didn’t know.",96597423

But, outside ankle support is a little bit too high and I needed to place padding.  So, this time, I bought 7 for DF2. It just fit perfect. In normal 3 mile run, I immediately gained time compared to Kayano23, as DF2 is so light. I feel good bounce back. And my foot are happy.",98367402
T7D0N,3,12/20/2017,"Stiff, poor transition, good comfort, low weight I have tried numerous asics shoes over the years, and as year passes they become stiffer. Same story with the dynaflyte 2. The midsole is extremely inflexible resulting in a midfoot slapping sound as you land. The transition is all wrong as a result, jarring knees and good more than necessary. The fit is slightly odd too - too long and narrow. I've had to size down which means the reinforced mesh at the bottom of the laces is tighter than I'd like over the midfoot. I like the low weight and the cushioning is pretty good, but this is an awkward clown shoe of a trainer. You might love it if your name's Krusty.",98308452

T7D0N,3,10/02/2017,"Something went wrong with the newer version I had a pair of Dynaflyte #1 and was eager to try the #2. However, I just could not love them. First, I had to return the 11.5 size and go for a half size smaller since the new version felt a little larger than the old. Second, the new version seems tighter in the center, and the sole of my feet hurts every time I run in them (I had the same problem even with the 11.5 size before I returned them).",93744576

T7D1N,5,10/24/2017,Great shoe. Love the no laces concept. Light shoe. Feel very comfortable. Plan to run the nyc marathon with it.,94629283
T7D1N,5,10/07/2017,Light and Secure The Flytefoam feel works exceptionally well for me.  It provides awesome cushioning and is very light weight.  The BOA lacing system provides even pressure on my foot. It is easy to tighten and loosen. Great collaboration with BOA. The transition from heel to toe feels smooth and efficient. I would suggest for the next version to have a pull strap on the heel to go along with the one already provided on the tongue of the shoe (minor). Love the mono-sock. It provides a seamless and very comfortable feel on the foot. Asics should consider the BOA system on kid's shoes.,94007820
T7D2N,2,12/12/2017,"Good for Racing I used these shoes for a few months, thought they were good until I realized they didn't have enough cushion for me and I started to have some problems with my Achilles. However, They are great for road races.",98053852
T7D2N,3,10/07/2017,"Extremely light Extremely light shoes, very beautiful design but not as soft as an Asics gel. It does the job though.",94011390

T7D5N,5,10/13/2017,"So comfortable I also sized back from 9 1/2 to 8 1/2
Such a light and comfortable running shoe, every step you fly lighter and faster, can recommend it to every woman who has a bit of none pronation",94307234
T7D5N,1,10/06/2017,"Poor sizing!!!! I'll start with: I LOVED the DynaFlyte 1.  I've had several pairs.  
I went for a run with the DynaFlyte 2 and am quite disappointed.  They are too large (by a ?half size or perhaps more) causing pain and blisters! - and I can't return them.   Definitely crushed!",93975639
T7D5N,5,09/29/2017,"Love them! Just when I thought ASICS couldn’t make a more comfortable shoe, they did it again with the Dynaflyte2.  Lighter, super comfy but supportive and FINALLY they gave me better color options since I love to rock them casually.  I wasn’t loving the neon. Thanks for listening ASICS!",93688409
T7D5N,5,09/27/2017,"Great Shoe! DynaFlyte is a great shoe, light weight, great cushion, good looking, but I agree with the previous comment regarding the sizing.  I always order 6.5, but apparently for this model you need to order half size less. Unfortunately I needed them for a run the next day I received them and could not return them, but I will take this in consideration for my next pair.  Apart from that, I fully recommend them.",93611863
T7D5N,2,09/20/2017,Sizes are off :( I love my original Dynaflytes (size 9) however bought the Dynaflyte 2 only to find I needed to go to size 8.5 and they still don't fit as well as the previous version :( I'm devastated!! I will stock up on original dynaflytes instead - but I wish asics would standardize their sizing.,93396119
T7D6N,5,09/15/2017,"Best shoe ever! I am a diabetic with flat feet, and I need a shoe that gives me room in the toe box, accommodates orthotics, and has a high-enough collar to support my ankle. This has been absolutely perfect! I have no more ankle pain whatsoever. AndI love that it is so light. Please, please, please, my running store (Sneakerama) said this is a limited edition. Say it ain't so! Please change nothing and keep producing them. I have worn Asics for years, but these, by far, are the best.",93268770
T7D6N,5,08/31/2017,"Light and comfy! I love the BOA system laces. They equalize the pressure on the top of the foot, not to mention there's a lifetime guarantee on them. If the laces break, BOA will send you a new set with instructions on how to install. The FlyteFoam is super light, cushy, and comfortable. This is a great kick-around-town shoe. I probably wouldn't run in it, though.",92814359
T7D6N,5,08/25/2017,Great features !!! Bought a week ago. I am a fifth generation rancher. My home is on a hill. First pair of shoes that I look forward to walking up & down the hill for one hour. Amazing fit & comfort. Not enough words to describe how happy I am with the great new purchase!!,92619784
T7D7N,5,12/15/2017,"LOVE I had Kayano 18 and 20, and I really loved them.  I thought I would be loyal to Kayano forever, but alas ASICS changed the fit, and newer models were no longer comfortable on my feet.  As I was searching for a different style, I landed on Roadhawk FF.  As mentioned by the previous reviewers, they run small.  I tried on my usual size 7, but it felt too tight around my toes.  I exchanged for a 7.5, and they fit perfect.  As long as ASIC doesn't change the fit as they release newer models, I will stick with Roadhawk FF.  Forget Kayano, I found my new favorite!  I loved the fit so much that I got a second pair in a different color.",98148626
T7D7N,4,11/21/2017,"Nice shoe, runs small I'm a long-time Asics customer. I always run/walk/workout in asics. This is my first time buying the Roadhawk FF shoes, and they definitely run small. These are much tighter than all the other asics I have purchased in the past (FuzexLytes, GT-2000s, GT-1000s) even though they are the same size. If I could go back I'd size half a size up. But they are a nice shoe, supportive yet lightweight.",97333584
T7D7N,5,11/17/2017,"First pair of Asics! After doing a little research online and a recommendation from friend I decided to give ASICS a try. I wanted try start running again, but when I would run I would get pain underneath my big toe afterwards. I didn't realize maybe I have an issue with over pronation. Running in these feels like a breeze, absolutley no pain during of afterwards. I love them!",97230335
T7D7N,5,10/28/2017,"Great product and value! I bought these shoes two weeks ago on line which I usually don't do.  THe shoes were exactly like the picture and description and they were true to size.  Needless to say I'm happy, shoes fit and my feet feel good during and after exercise!",95079508

T7E1N,5,10/13/2017,Excellent shoe I purchased these in India a few weeks ago. I was doing a lot of walking and my feet were killing me. I went into the store and picked up a pair of these and holy cow!! (joke) they are awesome. Feels like walking on pillows with great support.,94321447
T7E2N,5,12/29/2017,Basketball Ref I asked my ref buddy who does college ball to recommend a new all black shoe. He stirred me to these pair and i bought em. ive done 5 games with them now and they are the best thing ive done for my feet in some time. Lightweight and stylish. Good combo.,98578933

T7E2N,1,11/22/2017," The shoes  that I ordered killed my feet. I bought a pair from a store for the gym which were great. Very comfortable. So I decided to try a different pair for work. Wore them 2 times and had to return them. 
The quantum 360 did not work for me at all. Returned them to the company today.",97376170
T7E2N,5,11/15/2017,PERFECT!!! PERFECT!!! Very comfortable!!! I am a big fan of ASICS and Onitsuka Tiger (because my IDOL is Bruce Lee loves Onitsuka Tiger),97178618
T7E2N,5,11/09/2017,Good cushioning and support without extra weight I use these shoes to officiate college and high school basketball and I couldn't be happier with them. The gel provides cushion for the entire foot. The material is lightweight so the shoes don't feel heavy when sprinting. The outer material is soft and durable. The only thing I did was to replace the insoles with a pair of thicker running insoles so my foot wouldn't move around. These shoes look great and have performed excellent so far.,96925145
T7E2N,5,11/08/2017,"Amazing comfort I officiate basketball and in the two games that i have worn them, my knees and Achilles have not been as sore after running 2+ miles in the court.  Sizing runs a little small.  May get 1/2 size larger on next pair.",96888939
T7E3N,5,12/06/2017,"Exceptional Comfort Bought these two weeks ago, primarily to wear at work (Sports Physiotherapist). I've found them light & super-comfortable all day, which comprises several hours in the clinic & the gym with clients, plus on field work with teams.",97853932

T7E6N,1,12/28/2017,"Not Great, Stiff I really wanted to like these since you discontinued my GT 3000, but these are like running in blocks.  My legs feel fatigued after 1 mile.  I've never had this problem before.  They are stiff and lack the cushion I loved in the GT 3000.  You still have the GT 3000 for men, bring back the women's version.  Or make some something more comparable.  The GT 2000/1000 are not even close.  Disappointed.",98502013

T7E6N,4,09/28/2017,"Perfect Great improvement from my last pair of GT-2000! I had version 4 which I loved. This came out just in time as I needed a new pair! I think my favorite thing about the shoes are how they respond even when not running. During HIIT, for jumps, jump squats, lunges, etc, I feel very stable and sure with my steps. I feel very reactive in these shoes as well and lends for the feeling of having ""light feet"". I still have to wear my inserts for arch support but no matter, I love my shoes. Now onto the fit... I'm an 8.5 most shoes and 9 in sneakers. Compared to the last GT-2000s i had, this fits better around the Achilles. It also fits better all around. Now I will say this... these shoes fit a little snug so there's a possibility of having to size up if you own any other sneakers that are 9.5. On a different note, I love this color. When I find something I love, I like to buy in every color... unfortunately, asics needs a little more variation in color scheme or at least allow for customization. It's only for that reason I am not giving it FIVE stars.",93642998
T7E7N,4,11/25/2017,Feel Amazing! These shoes are amazing! I love them! They are so comfortable it’s like running with clouds of cushion on my feet. They breathe well for the summer but seem to keep my feet fairly warm in the winter as well. They are great for runners with high arches and narrow feet because they fit just right for all terrain and are lightweight. The only downfall to them is that they fit smaller than the size they say they are because of the cushion it has. I would suggest a half a size bigger when you buy them.,97481356
T7E7N,2,11/21/2017,Size ran sml Nice sneakers but.... Usually I order sneakers online and they fit fine. These seemes to run small :(,97337196
T7E7N,5,11/08/2017,Great shoe! I love this shoe! I have high arches and very narrow feet. These were the only runners that really hugged my narrow foot and made me feel like I had more control over them and they were a natural extension of my foot. I am using them to train for a marathon and so far no complaints!,96852939
T7E7N,5,10/12/2017,I love this shoe This shoe is so comfy right out of the box. I put it on and I knew I would not have to send it back. I only have worn nimbus but I loved this new style. It is so cute so I decided to try it and I’m not disappointed at all. It has the same cushion that nimbus does. In the heal and the forefront. Lately I’m having problems with my Achilles’ tendon because I broke my leg and for some reason the Achilles isn’t healing like it should and the nimbus shoes come up high in the back so I was looking for a shoe that was a bit lower and these are just right for that. They don’t push on it. I love these. I am a bit worried about durability. I hope they last.,94296123
T7E7N,1,10/01/2017," First time I bought a pair of Asics that did not feel good on my feet.  Order online

T7E7N,5,08/13/2017,"Great Shoe I received this shoe today, and just slipping my foot into it, I knew they were what I have been searching for.  As I work 12hrs shifts, it is important to me that my feet remain comfortable always.  These are the third Asics in as many weeks I have purchased in search of comfort primarily and style, and they did not disappoint with the Quantum 360 Shift.  I am scoring 4 on durability, as I have not had it long enough to make that judgment.",91929024

T7F2N,5,10/27/2017,The best The boa system its incredible and they feel and look great already with 110km of trail running in rocky situation and they look like New,94971942
T7F2N,5,09/19/2017,"BOA system is unbelievable I average 25-30 miles of trail running a week and I was a huge fan of the Fuji racer 3. But since that is no longer available I gave the fujirado a chance and wow. The mono sock is amazing and comfortable. The BOA system is a must have. Give me a perfect fit everytime. Very rugged and perfect for any trail run. I hope ASICS puts the BOA system on more shoes. The fujirado feels pretty light too, overall great fit. I usually wear a 11 and these fit true to size.",93383013
T7F2N,5,07/21/2017,"Great Tech The Fujirado feels very light.  The laces are thin and seem very strong. The BOA system dial is easy to use for tightening and releasing lace tension. You are assured of laces that will remain secure. The system feels like it provides a very uniform tension around the foot - which feels awesome.  It is as if my feet are a part of the sole. The mono-sock liner provides a welcoming wrap around the foot. After a bit of investigation online, it was discovered the BOA company assures online free replacements for laces if they should ever break. The sole is similar to the Fujiattack 5, which has proven for me to provide excellent traction, both uphill and downhill.  I also liked the loops provided on the heel and tongue area to assist on pulling the shoes onto your foot. This is a winner.",90701040

good snug fit for narrow feet, and cater to the foot rolling inwards.

T7K7N,2,10/18/2017,"Beautiful shoes, but ASICS changed fit and size I have been reading reviews for the new Product line coming out and did see that something was changed on the way the new line fits. I am a nurse and have used ASICS exclusively for the past 7 years. I have bought 13 pairs through online and in store purchases. These were recommended by my podiatrist, and I have loved them since the first pair. My boyfriend and I have the same shoe size, and he grabbed an old pair by the door to run out to his car, and was amazed at the comfort and feel of the shoe, even after several years of consistent pounding of the perverbial pavement “institute floors”...

That all being said, I wish I had listened to the reviews...spent hours going over the different shoes, bought 3 pairs, and 2 are the new releases and both are too small (toes squished concerning width and length - crammed at the top of shoe). Paid extra for faster next day shipping, was hoping to wear to work tomorrow and now have to go through the return process. If a general statement by the company had been made that there were size changes, I would have planned and bought accordingly. My free time is very valuable. Exchanging for a 1/2 size up and hoping that does the trick...",94451201
T7K7N,5,09/28/2017,"Just what I was looking for This is my first ASIC shoes, and so far I'm absolutely loving them! I feel like I finally found the support I was looking for in weight training and running. My only complaint is I can hear them make noise sometimes when I walk in them, but that's the least of my worries, because they're just excellent in the gym.
I wasn't buying the whole underpronation information they had available, but I highly suggest you check that out.",93658760

T800N,1,12/30/2017,NARROW The nimbus 20 is still in the narrow side. My feet went numb as soon as I laced the shoes up.,98676177
T800N,1,12/30/2017,Too narrow The 20 is still too narrow and seems shorter also.  Have been wearing the Nimbus for 18 years or so and the last good fit was the Nimbus 17.  I don’t see many 4E  choices if any at all!  Guess I’ll be moving on to another shoe maker.,98629530
T800N,2,12/29/2017,"""Improved"" fit still does not mean good fit I've been wearing the asics numbus model for years, going back to version 11.  I've always loved the fit and incredible cushioning.  Asics really messed up the sizing on version 19 as was pointed out by numerous reviewers.  I generally wear a medium width (and sometimes even a narrow in certain shoes) and had to go to a 4E width on version 19 for it to feel comfortable.  I was very excited when version 20 was supposed to have an improved fit and was hoping it would feel like my previous versions.  I do agree that version 20 is not as tight as version 19 (which was unwearable) but it still does not fit right in my opinion.  I usually am a 15 D, and this size still feels way too tight particularly in the toe box.  My toes are jamming against the edges of the shoe and feel compressed.  My heel also feels as if it is crossing over the back edge of the foot bed making me think the shoe is too narrow.  I tried on the 15 2E (although I've never had to wear a wide shoe in my life) - it felt a bit better in the toe area but the rest of the shoe feels just that - too wide.  On the positive side, it is a lightweight shoe with very good cushioning.  If one is able to go up a 1/2 size I would definitely suggest this.  That's a problem however when you are a size 15 and there is no size 15 and 1/2 (only a size 16 which is way too big.)  Overall, there are some positive aspects to the shoe but in my opinion the sizing is still way off and nothing like all the previous models I've come to adore.  I'll be trying on other brands now for sure.",98618429
T800N,5,12/27/2017,"Return to Accurate Sizing! GEL-Nimbus 20 is very comfortable with good cushioning.  It fits perfectly in my usual size, unlike recent Nimbus models that were unexpectedly too tight.  Fit is now equivalent to my old Nimbus 16's.",98476991

T802N,5,12/17/2017,The best Nimbus to date I have worn Asics along with other brands and always found the Nimbus comfortable but a little narrow in the toe box and heavy. Finally a Nimbus that has plenty of toe box room and is much lighter than previous models !  I find the Flytefoam a nice addition. It provides a nice return during the gait cycle and off sets the non responsiveness of the gel. This is my go to for most of my running !,98216394

These shoes do not wear out quickly! You'll be tried of how they look long before they need replaced. The only complaint from him is that they are not very stylish. It would be nice if Asics GT 20006 came in more vibrant color choices for teens. Because his feet no longer hurt he will pick them every time even though he calls them 'the grandpa shoes'.",98030980

I’ve only had my 20 for a few days and just getting used to the completely different feel compared to my adored 18. So too early to really judge, but so far they seem much lighter than the 18 but also much stiffer. I bought the pink and they are gorgeous!! So far so good. ",98354690

I have been wearing Nimbus for over 6 years and the last 2 releases were snug in the toes. The Nimbus 20 is greatly improved. They are so comfortable -  wider in the toe and it seems they are a little higher in the back of the shoe.  My foot stays in the shoe better while doing lunges. This shoe is a definite YES.,98322682

Also, the reflective tab on the toe of the mostly black shoe, is analogous to painting a big red dot on the tip of ones nose.  I wanted these for walking around in the office and on the street.  They pinch and look odd.  At least the reflective tab on the toe amused my wife.",

110196,3,08/26/2017,I guess made in China vs Vietnam size isn't the same. I'm really disappointed in the sizing with Brooks. I've found that a size 11 D isn't like it was in the past.  I've now got two pairs of Brooks with little wear that will be going to the goodwill store for hopefully someone else can wear.  If you can find a pair that fits they are great otherwise they will always be uncomfortable no matter how much time you give them to break in.,

Works well for my VERY flat feet and overpronation, BUT I have had four pairs in a row have a failure in the left toe area. The stitching at the back side of the front reflective patch (the side closer to the laces than to the front end of the shoe) comes apart, leaving a visible gap between the reflective patch and the mesh. On my most recent pair, this happened in under a week of simple walking. Sadly, I'll be switching brands. Overall, this is a great shoe for me but for that major, deal-breaking flaw.",

Also, the last two pairs I've bought had a very tight toe box, on one of each pair. The first pair caused me to lose the nail of my big toe, twice. The newest pair pinch my right little toe. Other than that, the Addiction shoes have been very good to me. I also have two pairs of the ""walker"" version, which are extremely comfortable. The other, minor, complaint I have, is the color selection is not great. I understand that you don't make many in the narrow width, so I have to take what's available, but the ""Anthracite"" color, even with the mesh uppers, can be pretty hot, in the Texas summer.",

One observation, though: the even numbered series shoes wear out faster than the odd numbered series. Doesn't make sense, but after over 40 pairs I can attest to it. Case in point: I'm on my 4th pair of #12s but only needed 2 pairs of the 11s, and one of my 11s is still in pretty good shape. Even so, I wouldn't wear any other shoe.",

110196,5,03/24/2017,Great Support I love the Addiction support. It combined with my custom orthotics has been the only thing to keep me from having pain on the outsides of my feet. My only issue is that the design looks so bad. My wife hates it when I wear the shoes since they look so nerdy. So I was really excited for the gray and white Beasts that just came out because the design is pretty sleek. The only thing is that even though the Beasts are more expensive I feel that they have less support on the ankles when cutting in sports such as badminton. Brooks could you please update the Addiction design to have something similar to the gray and white Beasts? The mesh & colors are pretty ugly. Thanks!,

110196,5,09/23/2016,Best shoes I can find. I require special shoes with extreme comfortability. And the only other brand that has come close is New Balance. But these are still more comfortable for me and cheaper. They last a good year of hard use. I don't know the average life of a shoe but thats more than enough for me.,

110196,2,07/09/2016,"Too Sparkly! I found two recent changes that make the shoe unwearable for me now.  First, I have pinkie toes that sit slightly higher on my foot than they do for other people.  There is now a strip on the outside of the shoe that goes right across where my toe is so it makes the toe sore.  The strip does not appear to be made of a material that will stretch.  The last pair of addictions I bought, and all prior to this pair, did not have that.  Second, they are now covered in this metalic kind of mesh that sparkles.  I am a woman who has very large feet.  I need these shoes for support and I wear them to work.  I'm a teacher, and therefore am always on my feet.  With big feet to begin with, why would I want to make them stand out even more with all of the sparkling??  It was such a great shoe, I always bought two pair a year, without fail.  Well, I guess my addiction is gone.  It's back to the drawing board for me, to find a shoe I can wear, and that is a very hard thing to do.  Why the heck did you have to change it??!!!",

110196,1,05/20/2016,"wanted running shoes, got blocks I've had Brooks off and on for 10yrs for running, even though I have always thought they were ugly shoes. Over those 10yrs I've tried to switch to Nike for running, since they've worked so well for me in basketball, but I always end up coming back to Brooks. In June 2014 I got the Pure Cadence 3's not so much because they were right for my feet, but because they had so much cushion from the very first time I tried them on and they were bearable to look at. The reason I say they weren't right for my feet is that I have very flat feet and severe pronation. However, I only run on the balls of my feet and never my heels so the cushion there in the Pure Cadence 3's won me over. I am an off and on kind of runner, not an avid runner, so they finally completely wore out recently. I bought the PureFlow 5's last week, ran 4.5mi in them that evening, and could barely walk in them when I was done. They felt like a plastic/rubber slab on my feet. I'm sure some people would say that I did not give them time to break in, but I had never had to do that with any Brooks I'd had in the past. So after returning the PureFlow 5's, I ordered these monstrosities (Addiction 12's). I didn't even put any running miles on these, because walking around in them for a day was enough to show me they are more like heavy boxes than shoes. Seriously disappointed in whatever changes Brooks has made with the soles of their shoes! I've always been a huge advocate for Brooks running shoes, especially for people with flat feet, but never again. Needless to say, I'm taking my flat feet and money elsewhere.",
110196,5,05/20/2016,"Great shoe for me I have a variety of foot and ankle problems, including completely flat feet, a large bunion on one foot, and multiple issues with one ankle from an old injury. I do a small bit of running, but a lot of walking - 7-10 miles every day. These shoes provide great support for my lousy feet, including good control for my overpronation. They provide ample room for orthotics (custom or off the shelf). Comfort level is great. My biggest kudos, though, come from durability. These shoes show less tread wear than any other shoe I've tried, including tactical boots that I've often worn to deal with my feet. Other athletic shoes I've worn (and even many boots) only last me two months or even less. High tech sole materials often break down quickly, and tread wears out quickly (including off-balance wear because of my overpronation.) Not these. I've gotten a solid 6 months out of these before wear becomes unacceptable (and in this instance, the piece that wraps around the end of the toe cap started to separate.) I'm really pleased with the durability, which is a huge bonus atop the comfort and control. I was disappointed that my local shoe store was out of my size and didn't anticipate getting more; when I came to the Brooks site, you were also out of my size/color combination, so I had to order from another online source. I would like to see more color choices; I'd order more pairs if that were an option.",

Also, I am NOT being compensated for these comments. Seldom do I ever comment on merchandise, except when it is truly exceptional. I use these shoes as an every day shoe. I have significant physical limitations and these shoes help me to walk more comfortably and for longer periods of time. They are solidly built and made to last. They fit exceptionally well. I would like to write something negative about this shoe, however, I cannot find anything to write about(I am not kidding).",

The combo of lightweight lots of cushion and control make them the best shoes ever. I wish they were even more cushioned as I seem to wear through them quickly. They seem true to size and are available in my odd 11.5 EE size. Kudos to Brooks!,
110196,5,02/03/2016,"Excellent for flat footed individuals If you are flat footed heavier person, this is a great shoe. It fits my feet perfectly, so I'm not losing balance when jogging with my feet sliding around. The sole gives you amazing support, as it's solid from front to back. The arch is high, but doesn't hurt, so it's great for helping prevent plantar fasciitis. The sides are firm, but the shoe is not too heavy. This also has better traction on the bottom of the shoe, over my previous pair of Brooks.",
110196,5,10/24/2015,Great shoes that handles whatever I throw at them I have had 2 pair of the Addiction and loved both.  My ankle issues are under control because of the stability of this shoe.

110196,2,10/21/2015,"Not a comfortable shoe I have flat feet and pronate so I wanted to find a more supportive shoe than what I've been using (Transcend 2 with custom orthotics). This was advertised as having more support and specifically designed for flat feet & severe pronation. The shoe feels heavy and is very tight/narrow. Just by looking at the toe area of this shoe, you can see that it narrows significantly more and sooner than the Transcend. Makes no sense that someone with flat feet would want a tight/narrow toe box. Bottom line is that the shoe was uncomfortable and tight, perhaps I should order a full size up and try again but with a race in a few weeks, I'm just going back to the Transcend.",
110211,2,12/24/2017,"Shoes feel great, built cheap. Shoes feels great on your feet. No break in time needed. But the shoes were constructed poorly.

110211,4,06/20/2017,"An interesting shoe to experiment with I bought these at a sale price as an experiment. I like trying random running shoes and seeing what works, and these shoes have a wacky look that I couldn't resist. The ventilation is pretty good, and I love how you can customize the fit around your foot by tightening the laces, which does more than just squeeze the top of your foot. The tongue is thin, but the laces work well with it, and they never seem to dig into my foot.The pods on the bottom of the shoe allow for some nice freedom for your foot if you're a neutral runner. The important thing to remember is that at least for me, these shoes required some break in time. Wear them around for a day or so, and start with a shorter run. The upper on these feels pretty stiff, and might create some hot spots along your toe knuckles until they're broken in. Otherwise, these are fairly lightweight, flexible, and kind of fun. I'd recommend trying them when they're on sale, since these shoes will probably not be for everyone.",
110211,5,04/24/2017,"Perfect shoe for a heel heavy runner I love this shoe...the impact feels really soft, especially for someone who's heavy on the heel, which is my case. Fits very well, love the design.",
110211,4,04/23/2017,"Great looking shoe I bought them primarily for the treadmill, but I have used them on the track and a pea stone pathway, and they have performed great.  The only drawback is that they seem a little narrow, and for some reason my right heel is sore after I take them off.",
110211,4,04/22/2017,Good shoe Satisfied with the shoe comfort. Outer materials took a little getting used to.,
110211,5,04/22/2017,"What a Find! I avidly use Brooks for running and working out. I saw this product was on sale and had never tried this model. I am wary of trying new shoes. The 90 day guarantee was a factor in my purchase. At first, the shoe felt somewhat uncomfortable but after just a few minutes of running, it conformed to my foot beautifully. I have bone spurs so the fit and cut of a shoe are critical.",
110211,5,04/21/2017,"A Learning experience-my fault, not Brooks So, selected 1/2 size smaller than my normal Brooks size due to me not running anymore and especially not running half marathon's. I was wrong, shoes are a little tight. I would also opt for Wide in width, just a little narrow to me. I love the way they look and I'm sure if I were still running, they would be great for that but the walking, biking and gym workouts I do with the shoes tell me other than my sizing mistake, I chose the right shoe. I do wish they were more ventilated.",

110211,5,03/27/2017,"Neuro fixed my knee pain! I have had severe knee pain from a torn meniscus. The Neuro shoe is designed with a lower heel than most athletic shoes which takes the pressure off my knee.  In addition, the sole of the shoe is cushioned which absorbs the pressure from striking the ground when running.  I ordered five more pairs of the Neuro in different colors so I am set for several years.",
110211,5,03/23/2017,Super awesome shoe! ,
110211,4,03/21/2017,Came damaged/overall good Bought these because I loved the style of the sneaker. I thought that the price was great. My only problem was that the lace of one of the sneakers was damaged. It was almost hanging by a thread. I did not return them because I did not want to go through the process of sending them out and then waiting. I missed the first attempt of delivery and almost missed this one. So I ordered new laces and everything is okay.,
110211,5,03/21/2017,I would suggest this product to anyone! Great fit and comfy! ,
110211,4,03/18/2017,"Great feel, questioning durability I love the feel of these shoes.  Exactly what I wanted.  A little wide in the heel, but I underpronate so need less ankle control.  My one complaint is the inserts are not solid 1 piece but have divisions.  The toe separation is driving me crazy, I will need to replace them.  First time I had that problem with that and Brooks.",

Impact can really be felt throughout the joints. Wished I could've found my packing slip for a return and trade up for my launch style. They are now once worn corner ornemants. Not a reflection on Brooke's at all though, and someone else may find them a good fit. Never straying again for me.",
110211,3,03/02/2017,"Not comfortable They got great reviews, which is why I decided to give them a try. I tried running in them to see if I needed to break them in, but it didn't make them anymore comfortable. I love Brooks, and it's all I wear. This style was just not for me.  I will probably head back to the Launch/Ghost.",
110211,4,08/18/2016,"The coolist and most comfortable fitting shoe. They have a bit of a break-in period, but it's to be expected, no problem with that. I wait for the day a shoe has no break-in period.",

It has a nice cushion when running, but it is heavier than other running shoes I have.",
110211,4,05/26/2016,Back to Brooks 23 miles in my new shoes and they are doing great accept the top of the tongue is too thin and if you do not wear socks it will cut the top of your feet,
110211,5,05/26/2016,"Dang awesome Spent 10 days in Europe, walked more than 8 miles a day. These Brooks made it enjoyable.",
110211,3,05/17/2016,"I really want to love this shoe I really want to be able to love this shoe! I really like the looks, think its really cool. The pod cushioning system is amazing, it felt kinda odd at first but it does a great job of absorbing impact and return the energy to your next push off. The split between the heel and the forefoot really seems to help/ encourage powerful push off on your toes. Like some reviews have said the shoe really seems to make you want to go faster. Now for the sad part, the reason I will be returning these shoes. The dynamic hammock. In theory it seems like a great idea, I really like shoes to have a second skin feel and this seemed like a great way to achieve that. Unfortunately It doesn't quite work out, the laces used in the hammock are fairly narrow, as you can see in the pictures, this means that when you have the system pulled tight it is putting a lot of pressure in a very small band running down the side of your foot. I didn't notice any discomfort towards the back half of my foot but the two forward bands are slightly uncomfortable when loose and very uncomfortable when the shoe is tightened down. I tried adjusting the looseness of the individual hammock laces but could not find a comfortable setting. Imagine if instead of having upper material holding your foot in the shoe you instead had laces attached directly to the sole, that's the feeling I get. If your feet, as mine do extend slightly over the sides of the shoe these will cut in when tightened. I am really sad about giving these shoes back, but maybe next generation will have these kinks worked out. My suggestion would be to widen the hammock straps as they approach the sole or put some stiffer material in between the straps and the foot as they approach the sole, so that the pressure from the hammock straps would be more evenly distributed as it is when it passes under the foot.",
110211,4,05/06/2016,Great running shoes. I bought this for PT. I've bought other brands and they just didn't work as well as these. The pounding on the hard surface sent pain up my legs. And with these shoes I don't feel that pain.,
110211,4,04/28/2016,My Son Really Likes these Shoes I got these shoes for my son who does a lot of running for track and cross country.  He says they work great and his feet no longer hurt.  The only thing is they can leave blue marks on the floor from the sole of the shoes.,
110211,5,04/14/2016,"Out of this world run-with a out of thi world look! All the innovations built into this shoe work in perfect harmony and give a truly enjoyable running experience. Their rebound makes you want to run at a faster pace, and they still manage to make my feet and legs feel fresh, mile after mile.",
110211,4,04/12/2016,Narrow shoe but good ,
110211,2,04/03/2016,Not for me I am an avid Brooks fan but had to send these back.  I found them narrow in the toe box and unusaully wide in the heel.  The very opposite of what I need.  I also found them to be clunky and without the ability to flex and role through the gait.  First pair of Brooks that I have ever sent back!,
110211,5,03/30/2016,"So far, so good Great alternative to PureFlows I have been running in for years. Feel vey similar when running but more cushioned, without loss of feel. They are kind of weird looking, but I don't look at my feet when running. I have only run in them 3 times so far, and no runs over 6 miles. Will see how they do on long runs.",
110211,2,03/24/2016,Not so good. The shoes fit nicely. I waited for them to come out and ordered them right away.  I have put less than 50 miles on them and the tread near the toe is gone. I always wear brooks shoes for running and have never had a problem with uneven wear. I have consistently gotten >500 miles out of a pair of brooks. I'm returning these.,
110211,4,03/23/2016,"A very comfy shoe. Very comfy! Really light. Actually like the separation in the heel, and for foot. Right shoe a little narrow but that's not Brook's fault. Wouldn't wear in rain but they do dry out fast. Would buy again if they offer a wide option.",
110214,5,10/22/2017,"These shoes are awesome. These shoes are awesome.  I can always tell when my cushion in my shoes go out because my feet start to ache.  As soon as I put these on, I could feel the amount of cushion and support immediately.",
110214,3,09/20/2017,Ghosts feel better ,
110214,2,07/30/2017,"not durable but comfortable shoe I used a adrenaline gts 7 for like 9 years (haha, i know...) ok was too lazy to get new ones as they just didnt disintegrate. Now I got these like 5 months ago. I must say I run relatively good in them. They are light and soft. Anyways the main topic is that they just tear apart. Like the pictures one person posted before. I used them also in rough terrain, but no reason that the glue dissolves like that!!!I hope in the newer models you fixed this. Cause I see this kind of under sole design in all of your new shoes and it would keep me from buying another pair of brooks. Did you address this issues?I must say as the gts 7 was so *** enduring I still have hope in this brand... prove me right please!",
110214,5,07/12/2017,really like this shoe I run in this shoe.  I have purchased this shoe before and really like it.  I have tried other shoes and keep coming back to this one.,
110214,5,05/06/2017,My go to shoes I've been running in these since Defyance 3 and plan to continue doing so. For some reason the Blue pair of Defyance 9 didn't fit as well as this Red pair.,
110214,4,04/28/2017,"Great Shoe This is my go to shoe.  Every time I've switched shoes my feet, knees, and back hurt, but this shoes gives me the support I need.",
110214,5,04/28/2017,My goto shoe until further notice! Bought these midway through training for a half marathon. They fit perfectly and there was absolutely no break-in period. Felt like I had been wearing them for years. Great overall running shoe.,
110214,5,04/25/2017,4th pair ,
110214,5,04/21/2017,"Foot Party They look substantial, but feel light as air. I had the D7's, and was like, ""What could be different?"" Then put these on and exhaled relief for like 5 minutes straight. My girlfriend thought something was wrong. But I was just in shoevana.",
110214,5,04/01/2017,I love these shoes ,
110214,5,03/08/2017,I love the shoe ,
110214,5,10/03/2016,Great Shoes! ,
110214,5,09/08/2016,Version 9 performs same as previous Defyance versions This is at least the 5th version of the Defyance model that I have owned. I like being able to order the same size of a shoe model that has worked for me in the past and find that it still fits and works for me.,
110214,5,08/30/2016,Great run Use as my daily runner and to my workouts at the gym   Shoe fits perfect. Wears a it quickly.,
110214,5,08/17/2016,Would buy this product again I am a coach so I am on my feet most of the day. This shoe is very comfortable,
110214,4,08/17/2016,Nice shoes I walk on a daily basis..I amean female but because of my narrow heel and wide front...and high arch this is the only shoe I've found that week accommodate all my feet challenges. I just wish you would make them in the women's sizes so I could have more applicable color choices. Wish the price was a little less.,
110214,2,08/12/2016,"Not Happy I use this product at work because I am on my feet alot during the day. I have always worn Brooks brand sneakers and have my Ghosts for over 2 years and still wearing them and they are holding up well. This shoe, after not quite 4 months, has started falling apart. The yellow tabs on the bottom are totally pulling away from the sole. The rest of the shoe is still in great condition. I contacted Brooks, and when they replied they said the normal shoe life is 4 months. (i really thought a brand as good as Brooks would have alot longer life span!!!)   I was disappointed they wouldn't stand by their product because i was about 3 weeks past the 90 day guarantee. The overall comfort of the sneaker was great, just unfortunate that I got a defective pair.",
110214,4,06/16/2016,"Great Shoe Shoe starts out with a tight toe box, but eventually loosens up and becomes very comfortable.  Would like to see more color options in this shoe.",
110214,4,04/15/2016,I like the shoe. I  do not like  the color ,
110214,5,04/01/2016,"Brooks please make a Defyance Trail The Defyance is very comfortable to run in sockless. And just right for everyday running trails in my area. The Ghost is best kept to roads, IMO. If only there was a true trail version, a Defyance ASR --  akin to the venerable New Balance 800 series of old, when I thru-hiked. The Cascadias have under-built upper and over-built outer (nix the rock plate), IMO.",
110214,5,03/26/2016,"An elegant shoe... I am not a runner ; I began wearing Brooks shoes for work. All of the Brooks models I've worn are great, but these are the best so far. I would describe the fit and feel as ""luxurious"". They are also a bit ""dresser"" than other models. I think they are awesome!",
110214,5,03/07/2016,Underrated Shoe My favorite shoe.  Fit is perfect for my feet but I don't need the medial post of the Adrenaline.  I need a neutral shoe that is somewhat stable and not too cushiony.  The Defyance fits that for me.  I went through many shoes from different brands before finding this one.  I do add Superfeet black inserts for a little better arch support but he combination has allowed me to run healthier than I have in years.,
110214,4,01/22/2016,Great Shoe The toe box started off a little narrow and hurt during the first couple of runs.  Now they fit good and haven't had any issues with them.,
110215,5,12/01/2017,I would buy these shoes again. I run 4 to 6 miles 4 days a week.  The shoes feel comfortable and soft.  They also keep my feet feeling warmer in our cold Pennsylvania climate.,
110215,5,11/29/2017,"Good show, would buy again I purchased this shoe for working out in the gym, biking and walking. It's very comfortable and so far durable. I was unsure about buying them online without trying them on but with the return policy I had nothing to lose. I did go in a have a professional size my foot prior to my purchase.",
110215,5,11/14/2017,great shoe with comfort and light weight ,
110215,1,11/08/2017,No support No support compared to the ghost or dyad I used to run with.Experienced pain after running twice with these on. Thankfully was able to return them.,
110215,3,11/05/2017,"Not terrible, but fit not for me ",
110215,5,11/05/2017,I Love my Launch shoes! ,
110215,5,10/26/2017,"I love, love, love the Brooks Launch 3!!! love, love, love the Brooks Launch 3!!! Great every day trainers, even for a big guy like me. Truly feel the energy returnwith each step.",
110215,5,10/24/2017,I love my Launch 3! I love wearing these when I want a quick walk vs my Addiction 12 or my Ghost 10.,
110215,5,10/24/2017,"Love this sneaker I have been buying Brooks sneakers for work (lots of standing in Hospital setting) and the gym. They are very comfortable, but my first two pairs were too small. I purchased this shoe a size bigger than normal and it is perfect. Love the support, comfort, and how light they are. Great price as well! #ReviewSweeps",
110215,5,10/24/2017,"Great shoes for speed and distance I'm on my fourth pair (with another two in boxes) and love them. I'm about to run my second marathon this year with the Launch 3 and I couldn't be happier with them. They have enough cushion to keep my feet happy for the long slow 20-milers, but they're also light and springy, so they work great for the track, mile repeats, tempo runs, and pushing 26.2 at race pace.Two small downsides. First, they feel a little bit small, so make sure you're going up at least a half size, if not a full size (I had to go up to 11.5 for these, when normally a Brooks 11 works for me). Second, and this isn't really a problem with the shoe itself, but I found I had to wear cushioned inserts on recovery runs after 18-20 milers because there just wasn't enough cushion for my sore feet. Don't get me wrong, they're great during the long runs and marathons, but I need a little extra squish the day after.",
110215,4,10/24/2017,ok ,
110215,5,10/22/2017,"Highly recommended My new running shoes that I devote only to running are great.  Comfortable, light and stable. I'll be back again to pick up another pair in a few hundred miles! #ReviewSweeps",
110215,5,10/19/2017,So far so good.  The shoe feels stable and fits as expected. ,
110215,5,10/19/2017,LOVE my Brooks shoes I have purchased Brooks for 2 of my Sister's to walk in...i wanted them to be comfortable as well..The Ghost 10 are certainly to most comfortable...,
110215,4,10/16/2017,"It was a good show and served me well Great for running, and supported an ankle injury really well. Didn't last as long as I expected, but way longer than most major brands.",
110215,5,10/10/2017,"Fits good Comfortable shoe, comparable to Brooks shoes I lost in Hurricane Flood.  Switched to Brooks last year looking for better fit, foot is long and narrow. Would buy again.",
110215,5,10/09/2017,Very nice ,
110215,5,10/08/2017,48years I have been running!! Perfect shoe been running 48 years..never ever bought the same shoe 3x in a row til now,
110215,5,10/07/2017,"FIrst Time Brooks customer but not the last I have bought ever brand of sneaker out there. All came with high recommendations, but my feet always hurt when walking my 3-5 miles a day. I tend to walk on the inside of a shoe so was desperate to find a more comfortable fit for my feet. Well I did! Will never buy another brand other than Brooks! I have worn them everyday since I received them. Bought the Launch and Pure Flow and both are great. I am a life long customer now! Thank you.",
110215,5,09/24/2017,Love my Brooks Launch 3 I do various activities some of which involve running and standing for long hours in a day but no matter what activity Brooks help to reduce stress and keep me comfortable all day long.,
110215,3,09/17/2017,"I love I've been wearing Brooks Launch since the original was available. This is the lowest quality model I've ever received. Stitching is coming apart at the toe box already. I've had these for less than a month. I don't think the fabric at the outside of the toe box is going to hold up nearly as well  as the mesh that used to be used on this shoe. If it weren't for the comfort/ride of this shoe, I would be buying something else",
110215,4,09/12/2017,"I would buy Brooks again when they are on sale. The hardest thing about buying on-line is sizing. I was skeptical about the 11. My brother wears Brooks at 10.5 for most things, and based on your sizing tool, I do as well. However, for this shoe, it recommended size 11--thank GOD I listened. Perfect fit.It's a nice shoe--a bit less substantial than I expected, but still, overall, I'm pleased with the purchase.",
110215,4,09/12/2017,"Extremely comfortable, no foot problems at all. I walk five to five and half miles daily due to hip issues. This shoe is extremely comfortable.",
110215,5,09/05/2017,Great purchase ,
110215,3,08/29/2017,"Wonderful shoe, wish the sole was more hearty ",
110215,5,08/22/2017,Great Shoes ,
110215,4,08/11/2017,"Running happier than in my Glycerines or Adrenalines For runs up to two hours, this shoe has had sufficient cushion for comfort while allowing me to feel the running surface below me. The light weight compared to more structured shoes that I have used in the past is noticeable. Therefore, I would say this shoe is helpful for those needing a neutral cushioned shoe and want to run happy.",
110215,5,08/03/2017,My son loves them ,
110215,5,07/30/2017,Excellent shoe I run around 15 miles a week and I love this shoe!! The launch 3 is the best shoe I have found with a 10mm heel to toe drop and leaves me with zero muscle soreness on the calf or shin. They wear very evenly with a fairly normal stride and the laces grab tight and don't even need double knotting. Highly recommend these shoes!!,
110215,5,07/29/2017,"These are really really really good shoes! I use my Launch 3s for road running, (cinder) trail running, and on a treadmill.  They are nice and light, yet very sturdy and supportive... an all around great balance of things. The mesh-like lining makes the shoe extremely breathable. If you ask me... I'd buy a pair.",
110215,3,07/29/2017,Heel is low compared to other sneakers ,
110215,4,07/28/2017,Great shoe straight out of the box I've run in the Launch for a couple of series and like it. It is one of the most well-cushioned shoes for the weight and holds up really well. The stitching is a problem and always has been. It'll rub you around the toes (wear socks!) and possibly the heal area if you aren't strapped in just right. Slightly narrow mid- to forefoot but still a good overall shoe.,
110215,4,07/26/2017,comfortable for high arches ,
110215,1,07/23/2017,Tight To small. To tight.  Launch 2 is souch better. Why such drastic changes? I sent them back,
110215,5,07/22/2017,"Great Shoe I am a High School Cross Country runner so I run very often, and I must say these are the best shoes I have ever run in. Very cushioned, but sturdy durable enough to withstand 45-50 miles every week. I purchased these shoes last summer (June 2016) and used them up until now (July 2017), just buying the next size up if I found they were getting too small. Recently, I opted for another Brooks model, GTS 17, instead of getting another Launch 3. The GTS 17 didn't feel as natural and light weight as these shoes, so I found myself lacing up the Launch 3s in the morning instead of my newer shoes. Yesterday, I purchased the Launch 4, and as a tribute to the Launch 3 for being my go to shoe for a greater part of my high school career, I decided to leave a review for this great shoe.",
110215,1,07/15/2017,run small Love brooks. i have several pair . I was very excited to get the 3 as i loved the launch 2. However they are way to small.. What did you guys do? Very Disappointed,
110215,5,07/14/2017,Go-to running shoe now Best shoe for me since NB890V1.  Nothing compares.  I really enjoy the supple feel of these shoes; just enough grippyness with smooth push-off.I use an insert and it does not bother this shoes feel at all.  Training for my next full and this shoe will be on my feet.,
110215,4,07/12/2017,"Great shoe at a great price Bought these shoes on clearance through the Brooks site.  Upon arrival, the shoes fit well.  Spent a few days wearing them around the house, then took them to the track for my morning workout.  I am not a runner, but an avid walker.The shoes worked out great.  Slightly lighter than my GTS-16 that I normally wear, but just as comfy without the bulk.  Definitely worth the price.",
110215,3,07/11/2017,"I LIKE IT, BUT HURT ME I love how this shoes feel it when running, but for the poor support I got hurt. After a month using it, was already wears.",
110215,1,07/07/2017,"Never again! These shoes are straight up garbage! The only reason I give them one star is because it won't allow you to put zero. Bought a pair and within 10 days, the toe box on both shoes began to blow out. By the third week, they were completely unwearable. Stay away!",
110215,5,06/28/2017,Outstanding shoe. I own 4 pairs ,
110215,5,06/28/2017,"only running shoe to own! PERIOD I have been running in the launch for at least 7 years now, Have slipped another Brookes runner in here and there. BUT, the launch is ""my shoe""",

I love the shoes and are the only shoe i can wear without my feet,ankles and knees not hurting after wearing them for any length of time...",
110215,2,05/28/2017,Shoe size too small and hot when running The shoe feels half size too small and my feet feel very hot when running in them.,
110215,5,05/26/2017,Extremely comfortable shoe! ,
110215,3,05/24/2017,Not what I expected. I took the quiz to find the right shoe and thought it would be similar to the Ghost 8. I was wrong.,
110215,1,05/16/2017,"Size too small I tried these shoes on and they were extremely tight. I've been running exclusively in Brooks shoes for the past 5 years. Adrenaline which was sold to me at a running store for support, then Glycerin and Ghosts once I tried the shoe finder on the website. Thought I'd try these because they were on sale, but they are so small and narrow I'm just returning them and getting another pair of Ghosts.",
110215,4,05/11/2017,My son loved these the moment he put them on! My son who is 12 needed a shoe with med to high arches as his feet were starting to bow in and complain of foot and ankle pain... because of terrible shoe support.  I decided to try brooks. I have a pair and love them. He does a lot of running around and playing with kids at school or in the neighborhood. He loved them and could tell a difference the moment he put them on. He hasn't complained about the pain since!!,
110215,4,05/08/2017,My go to shoe for tempo and long runs. For me it's a good compromise between some cushion and being light and responsive.,
110215,5,05/07/2017,Goodbye Nike ,
110215,3,04/28/2017,"So close to perfect I absolutely love everything about this shoe EXCEPT for the unusually high (or curved?) heel cup. The cushioning is great, the shoes fit like a glove, and my body--hips, knees, ankles--feels great after a run. But man there is something funky going on in the achilles area. One run and I had *shredded* the skin over both achilles tendons. This seems to be a problem that other online reviewers have noted as well. I'm really hoping there's some easy fix (maybe a little trim with some scissors?) because I would love to be able to keep using these shoes.",
110215,1,04/25/2017,"Failure to Launch I have logged an average of 30 miles per week, with summer peaks in 50-60 mile range, for the last five years -- every single mile has been in a pair of ""on-sale"" Brooks.  For the first time in my running career, I find myself in total agony in a pair of trainers right out of the box. Was persuaded by a review claiming the Launch was similar to the Ghost (a model I've logged 1000's of miles in the last couple of years).  Not even close.  The Launch is a failure to launch.",
110215,5,04/24/2017,Favorite Running Shoe! I love the Launch series! I've used this series for the last year and a half and have gone through 5 pairs. Each pair lasts me about 500 miles and could probably last longer but prefer around the 500 mile range. They're an extremely versatile shoe handling long runs well and speed work equally well. The balance between responsiveness and cushion is perfect. I love these shoes and do not plan on switching!,
110215,5,04/22/2017,"Love the Launch Series I got the Launch 2's last year and this year I got the Launch 3's for the upcoming track season. They are great shoes and feel amazing to run in. However they do tend to wear  quickly, not the sole which is amazing but rather the insole can get a little compacted and the outer mesh can tear. Keep in mind I don't go easy on these shoes but I've had my newest pair for 2 months now and they are wearing down a little. Overall, an amazing shoe that I strongly recommend for most activities.",
110215,5,04/21/2017,"Love em! Training for my second marathon and really loving my long runs in these shoes. I have been running in Adrenalines for a while, but these are giving me an extra boost of confidence with the light weight and springing soles.",
110215,5,04/20/2017,"comfortable running shoe Very comfortable shoe.  This is my first pair of Brooks. I was looking for a more comfortable alternative to Nike or Asics.  Although some of the color patterns could be improved, the shoe is great to wear and great for running.  I have only logged about 30-40 miles over a few weeks so far, so I can't comment about durability yet, but so far so good.",
110215,3,04/20/2017,"Launch 2 was better I had two pair of the Launch 2 and marathoned in that version.  The Launch 3 does not have as much cushion under foot, particularly the forefoot and feels more narrow through the toebox.  Brooks is too quick to update great shoes ...",

110215,5,04/10/2017,"I love them! I have only run/worked out with these in a gym, so I can only provide a limited review. That being said they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever had. I am new to running and am struggling, but I feel these help make the process better. I initially ordered half a size too small, but that was my fault and not the shoe's! Really I should buy a couple more pairs because I don't want to let these go!",
110215,4,04/07/2017,"Great Value I bought this shoe for 2 weeks of training in Arizona. It was great on the flats, light and fast. I wore it on a 20 mile day with over 2000' of elevation gain and loss. The shoe was comfortable throughout. I even used the shield on a few short sections of trail during a longer run and the shoe handled the terrain well, despite its minimalist tread. Great shoe for the reduced price. I'm anticipating getting another 100 or so miles out of them and then retiring them.",

110215,5,04/01/2017,"Great running shoe! I use this for medium distance runs between 3-8 miles. They are well cushioned for comfort and seem to return energy very well. I've completed some sprints in them and I would say they handled adequately, but of course the extra cushion detracts slightly from using them extensively for this purpose. Overall, a great shoe that I would absolutely buy again.",
110215,4,03/31/2017,"Like this shoe a lot I have now worn Brooks Ghost, Glycerin and Launch. Ghost is probably my favorite but so far (3 weeks in) Launch is a close second. I find the Glycerin to be too much shoe - tended to make my legs feel heavy and tired. I like the energy return from the Launch. I run 15 to 20 mile per week and have had no issues with less cushion in the Launch. I will definitely buy it or the Ghost again.",
110215,5,03/31/2017,"Super fast feet with these new Launch shoes I have been in Brooks shoes since I took up running 4 years ago, and these shoes have been the lightest that i've purchased.

110215,5,03/18/2017,"Wonderful Emergency room nurse and avid athlete, shoes easily hold up to 13 hour shifts and anything I throw at them",
110215,5,03/17/2017,"Would buy more, very comparable to shoe I used to always buy Used to always buy ASICS Gel Nimbus shoes during XC and track for high school. Latest pair though seemed more plasticy, and gave me blisters in odd areas I used to never get blisters. Saw these were on sale and has always heard good things about Brooks from my dad and other athletes. Definitely a comparable shoe, and will probably buy 1 or 2 more to stock up on for a while.",
110215,4,03/16/2017,Comfortable These shoes feel great very comfortable! I hope they last. Stitches are pulling out at toe.,
110215,5,03/14/2017,Love these ,
110215,5,03/14/2017,i love this shoe I love the shoes and have been wearing them for over seven years for marathon training and 5K races. The only thing that I don't like is the heals  wear out quickly,
110215,3,03/11/2017,Nice shoe for the short run Overall this is a good looking and feeling shoe.  My only complaint is that the toe box seems a little smaller than what I'm used to from Brooks.  I have been running in Ghosts for 5+ years and have loved them.  I decided to try these to be different.,
110215,4,03/10/2017,very comfortable Shoes are extremely comfortable and light weight.  No good for pronation control.  Tend to run a bit narrow as compared to some but similar to other shoes.,
110215,4,03/09/2017,Would have been great! Had to return these due to insufficient width choice.  Please make available more reasonably priced shoes like this in a wide width.,
110215,5,03/08/2017,Love it ,
110215,5,03/07/2017,My third pair! ,
110215,5,03/06/2017,Launch 3 still rock ,
110215,5,03/04/2017,Best shoes I ever bought much better than Nike ,
110215,5,03/03/2017,"Awesome I love these shoes, and how they seem to adapt more and more to me during each run.",
110215,5,03/03/2017,"Awesome!!! I love the flexibility in this show, and how with every new run the shoe seems to adapt to me.",
110215,5,03/03/2017,Great shoe! Very comfy So far it has been a fantastic shoe. I only use it for weight room work and for daily wear. Seems to hold up well,
110215,5,03/03/2017,Excellent shoe for walking or running!! Great walking or running shoe.  Our cross country kids LOVE the Launch and my husband loves the Launch for just walking.  Very supportive and extremely comfortable.,
110215,5,03/02/2017,Definitely recommend this shoe I've used the shoes about at least five times a week for the past month. This has been my first pair of Brooks and I am very impressed with how they have changed my running experience. I am beginning to train for my second half marathon and the difference in comfort and support from my previous shoe is remarkable. I'd recommend if you haven't tried the product or this shoe you should give it a shot!,
110215,5,02/23/2017,I feel faster ,
110215,5,02/10/2017,Best running shoe that i have ever put on my feet I was developing aches and pains in my knees - especially on long runs.  I had been running in Nike shoes for years.  I expressed what was happening to my knees to my wife.  She bought me a pair of Brooks Launch 3 and they eliminated my problem almost immediately.  The best way I've found to describe these shoes is that - I feel like I am running on air.  It was by far the best Christmas gift I received this year and I can promise you if Brooks continues to produce shoes as well made and as responsive as these shoes they will have a customer for life in me!,
110215,3,01/06/2017,"If you love the Launch 2, you may not Love the Launch 3 Walk about 15 miles per week (for dog). Run about 10 miles per week (3 miles per session).  Loved the Launch 2 from Brooks, but they are mostly discontinued and hard to find. Went with Launch 3 thinking it would be similar, but something's changed.  I don't get the same arch support and responsiveness from these.  They are still good quality, but not as good as the Launch 2s. Feet hurt more when walking, running is a bit better.",
110215,2,12/06/2016,Its seems Brooks shoes are shrinking? I only wear a size 14 in Brooks shoes (13 in everything else)...and now these 14s are too tight/short too?!? gone from only-brooks to not so sure about our relationship any more. ;-(,
110215,5,11/27/2016,"Out Front Outstanding cushion, lightweight, very responsive springy/rebound. Very well ventilated. Low price. Great looking too.  Bravo Brooks. You are the champion.",
110215,5,11/25/2016,"Amazing!!! I absolutely love these! I wore the heck out of my Brooks launch 2's. There was only one problem when i ordered a size 12 in these, they felt a 1/2 size too small. I returned them and got a size 12.5 and it was the perfect fit!",
110215,3,10/30/2016,"Great shoe, but left leg hurts during run. I run 3-6 miles three days a week.  Mostly street runs.  With these shoes, my left calf muscle began to hurt at the 3/4 mile point.  Shoes felt good.  I just could not get past the left leg pain.",
110215,5,10/17/2016,"Great running shoe Have taken these shoes out for 3-4 average distance runs and have had no problem. Really enjoy running in them, and love the energy response they give off with my stride.",

110215,5,10/01/2016,Great shoe!!! Just wearing them casually right now. Feels like a great shoe. I am looking forward to running in them consistently.,
110215,4,09/20/2016,Light and Sleek ,
110215,5,09/20/2016,"Great, light weight shoe that still holds up on longer runs. I wear a 7.5 in every shoe, no matter what brand... Except for this shoe. I needed a size 8. The shoe is lightweight and still feels comfortable after a beating, so it's my main go to running shoe right now.",
110215,5,09/17/2016,Launch 3 I use the Launch 3 for running and some gym training. My old launches i use for work. The comfort of this shoe is unbelievable. My go to shoe for running.,
110215,4,09/14/2016,Great fitting and good looking shoe First time going with a Brooks Running shoe and so far I love it - I'll definitely be back for more!,
110215,5,09/14/2016,I would buy this shoe again ,

110215,5,09/06/2016,"these are great for a long distance run My son runs for cross country team for high school team ,he no longer complaining of feet and arche pain when running .These shoes are great for long distance runs.",
110215,5,09/05/2016,Great fit and very comfortable Very comfortable.  Found my size years ago with Brooks and buy online without any issues.,
110215,4,09/05/2016,Amazing shoe but toebox seems tight Using the Brooks Launch 3 for marathon training and planning to run a marathon in them. I love my blue Launch 3s and bought this green pair as an alternative. But the toe box feels tight on this pair and caused my toes to rub together and develop blisters between them on my first long run with them (12 miles). I've loosened the laces as far as they will go and put vaseline between my toes and this seems to have solved the problem. Otherwise an excellent running shoe for people who don't suffer from over pronation and so don't need a lot of arch support but want enough cushioning for long runs and want responsive soles and light weight for speed.,
110215,5,09/05/2016,A comfortable shoe with a sports mode THANK YOU BROOKS RUNNING FOR MAKING A GREAT SHOE. I USE THEM FOR FAST SHORT AND LONG  DISTANCE RUNS. IT'S COMFORTABLENESS GIVES THE RIDES OF A CADILLAC YET WHEN THE PUSH IS NEEDED THEY DEFINITELY PROVIDE THE SPORTS MODE SUSPENSION. I'M A HAPPY RUNNER,
110215,5,09/05/2016,Amazing Fantastic shoe. Probably the best I've ever had the pleasure of wearing. These shoes actually made me want to take a run just for the heck of it. Plus they're USA themed so they're automatically freaking awesome. Highly recommend.,
110215,3,09/03/2016,Good but not great ,
110215,5,09/03/2016,Love! ,
110215,4,09/02/2016,"It's a shoe. They're nice. The material makes it get wet really easy, so I'd run with moisture wicking socks for sure.",
110215,4,09/02/2016,"Great running shoes so far, still testing Light, confortable, feel a bit longer than i was expecting from the online chatts, but not 100% sure if a smaller size would have been better.Still early to know pros and cons",
110215,5,09/01/2016,"Wonderful Shoe I love this shoe. I'm a new Brooks fan.I was in the market for a new pair of shoes. I bought a different, overpriced pair from a ""fit your foot"" B&M store in town, but returned them after getting cold feet (no pun intended). The sales guys didn't seem to actually care much and I didn't feel like I truly got a good fit. I took to online, came to the Brooks website, took the fit quiz, and this was my top return. With a 90 day no risk trial, I gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did.I have high arches and slightly under pronate, and these so far have done the trick for me. I have about 50 miles on them and am quite pleased. They do give a nice little 'bounce' in my step, too. There were no blisters while adjusting to a new fit - my feet have been quite happy. And I have not experienced fatigue or foot pains during the ~ 4-6 mile runs I have made in them.The only minor ""con"" I have so far is that, if anything, they do seem slightly narrow. It's slight, though, so I would not go so far as to say that it's a major issue. If you do have particularly wide feet, though, that would be something to take into consideration.",
110215,4,09/01/2016,Good ,
110215,4,08/31/2016,Another great Launch Launch 3 is a great shoe and if you were a fan of Launch 1 and 2 then you will love #3.,
110215,5,08/31/2016,Great Shoe ,
110215,3,08/31/2016,Would recommend if.... This shoe is best for those wanting a light weight shoe that is responsive not needing much cushion.,
110215,5,08/30/2016,"It's Back! I ran through 4-5 pairs of the Launch 1 and found the 2 to be too flat/non responsive.  The 3 is much more like the original but maybe even more comfortable.  They do run slightly small in length, so buy 1/2 size up!",
110215,5,08/30/2016,great all-around shoe ,
110215,5,08/29/2016,"If eternity is heaven, then running is a part of heaven!! When I buy Brooks at a box store (i.e. Academy, etc.) the size seems to be different, then when I bought them from you.  I just need to learn the sizing system.  Love these shoes.",
110215,5,08/29/2016,"best pair yet! Favorite running shoes! Only buy brooks for running bc they don't cramp my feet, no blisters, and durable.",
110215,5,08/28/2016,Love em! ,
110215,4,08/28/2016,Loving it! Great show I like to alternate them with my pure flows and I'm training for a marathon with them. GIVE THEM A TRY!,
110215,4,08/28/2016,so far a great product ,
110215,5,08/28/2016,LOVE THESE SHOES ,
110215,5,08/28/2016,"Best Shoe ever! I use the Launch 3 for the gym, sprints, distance, and for trail running. I only use brooks and tried every shoe.  This shoe by far is the most comfortable and I get more out of my workouts.",
110215,4,08/28/2016,Launch 3 I use this product for training runs up to 9 miles and for short pace work but not for shorter speed days on the track.,
110215,4,08/26/2016,Fast and flashy ,
110215,4,08/26/2016,"like them but think think they are smaller than the launch 2 I run on average 40 + miles a week,  I use the ghost, launch 2 and the launch 3 now to alternate my shoes.  unfortunately running 10 miles with the launch 3 I got blisters on my toes and over my instep.  I like the way they fit but after running for a while I can tell that my feet will regret it later on.  The launch 2 seems to have a bigger toe box than this launch 3",
110215,4,08/25/2016,Launch 3 impressive ,
110215,5,08/24/2016,Great shoe ,
110215,4,08/23/2016,"Comfy Shoe I'm in the middle of training for the Marine Corps Marathon and this by far one of the most comfy shoes. However, I have really, REALLY flat feet :/ This doesn't offer enough over pronation support. You can add you own insert if you choose. I do appreciate that it travels well from road to gravel. Overall it's a really good shoe!",
110215,5,08/22/2016,"The Perfect Shoe For years I ran exclusively in the Brooks Adrenaline line. After testing some other shoes within the Brooks offerings I landed on the Launch and have not looked back. I average 50 miles a week and have found this shoe to be a pleasure to run in. They are lite weight, yet cushioned and I have owned 6 pairs and they have all held up well to the pounding they recieve. Great shoe!!",
110215,5,08/20/2016,Great reliable fit. Great fit for runners that like a wide toe box. I use these for runs up to 6 miles.,
110215,5,08/15/2016,"Good Running Shoe I like this shoe! Do the true to fit to ensure the size is right. I've worn these on trails, roads and sand. Good feel. Last race was a 10K and my feet felt good during the run. Normally wear a 7.5 in Nike & Asics...got an 8 and that works.",
110215,5,08/12/2016,Love this shoe ,
110215,3,08/01/2016,"Feels good, but falling apart after 2 runs I'm a 150 lb middle distance runner who is either running on the road or track. This shoe feels good and has a good balance between support and weight. However, after only two runs, the shoe started coming apart. The upper mesh started ripping and the logo on the tongue was rubbed off. I was told this shoe would last 250 miles, but I am concerned it won't make it that far.",
110215,4,07/28/2016,"LAUNCH I run about 30 miles per week and the last four pairs of running shoes I bought have been Brooks.  I really enjoy the product but find the sizing maybe a little off.  Generally I wear a size 9, I have Ghost in 9 which fit fine and Glycerin in 9 which feel snug.  When I purchased the Launch though I would take Brooks advice and get 0.5 size larger.  I ordered a 9.5 and with the half size larger I am experiencing heel rub, chafing, and blistering.",
110215,5,07/26/2016,"Amazing, light, bouncy shoe In the last 2 years I have been running half marathons and marathons exclusively in a different brand. Every time I went to a running store, they recommended Brooks to me, even my marathon running friends recommended them to me, but I always stuck with my tried and true brand. I decided to try Brooks and took the online shoe finding quiz and was set with the Launch. Upon running in them for the first time I fell in love. The shoe is fantastically light, super responsive and bounces back (which I like - I dislike how so many running shoes feel like cement blocks when you run), the size is true, and it comes in some of the best designs and colors I've seen. I've run on concrete, grass, treadmill, and dirt with these and they have never hurt my feet. At first, it felt too narrow near the toes, but that was adjusted through my lacing. Overall, I'm loving these shoes and can't wait to run my next marathon in them. An added bonus is that you cannot beat this price!",
110215,4,07/25/2016,"Great shoe, tight toe box I work in a profession where I walk 7-10 miles a day in buildings on hard floors. I have had the prior versions of these shoes in the past and love the long day use without sore feet. The shoe hold up to a long day of being on my feet, arches never get sore. One con of note is that this version of the shoe the toe box feels tight and by the end of the day the lateral side of my big toe was becoming sore. Changing socks helped with this.",
110215,5,07/24/2016,Launch 3!! Another great addition to the launch series. I've bought a multiple products from Brook's depending on my running regimen. I've used launch since the 1st pair and the 3rd edition has surpassed my expectations.  Launch is a great overall shoe for multiple types of running. I love them.,
110215,5,07/23/2016,"Another winner! This is my 8th or 9th pair of the Launch. They are perfect for me. I have n her found a running shoe I love so much! My only ""complaint"" is that you need more and funkier color options! I love my shoes wild for motivation!",
110215,4,07/22/2016,Pretty good I run every day and it's a very capable shoe. It's a very good shoe. It unfortunately is very stiff.,
110215,5,07/22/2016,Awesome!!! ,
110215,5,07/20/2016,"Best shoe ever I love using the Launch 3 while I am racing, working, gym, and training. It's one of the most versital shoes for an athelet or someone just wanting a comfortable shoe.",
110215,4,07/19/2016,"Light and comfy I was surprised at the low levels of support on the inside of the shoe, but actually now that I've gotten used to it, I like it.  It pulls your feet more parallel.  The shoes are light and comfortable.  There is plenty of room in the toes, while the mid sole and heel are supported.",
110215,5,07/13/2016,"AWSOME! Great shoe,Brooks customer for life I walk/run at least 5 times a week. most of the time a 5k.I love everything about the LAUNCH series and will continue to buy them.NO downside to this shoe for me",
110215,5,07/10/2016,"Convinced a non-runner to start running! As someone who typical doesn't enjoy the straight up activity of running (I generally prefer to get my cardio through basketball, football, etc.) these shoes have convinced me to get out and run...for the sake of running. I used to struggle with shin splints/bad knees but after using the Brooks shoe finder, which suggested these, I haven't experienced any major negatives. Good stuff!",
110215,5,07/10/2016,I'm completely satisfied with the Launch 3. Great Shoe.:-) ,
110215,4,07/08/2016,"Comfortable and stable Love my Brooks. Probably my 8th pair and just like the rest very comfy and ready to rock. Spin class, weight training, rowing, walking, running, sailing all this and more with Brooks on my feet.",
110215,1,07/05/2016,Returned I was disappointed with the material change of the upper from the previous version.  The launch 2 fit like a sock and disappeared when running.  The new launch 3 upper is very rigid and inflexible.  It lost the quality and feel I was looking for so I returned them and stocked up on the previous version while still available.,
110215,5,07/03/2016,Great shoe I am a 40 something runner that averages 25 MPW.  I developed an achilles injury running in a different brand. I happened upon the Launch 3 at an expo and couldn't  be happier. It has a perfect blend of cushion and responsiveness. Hopefully they won't change for the next version.,
110215,4,06/28/2016,"Work Horse Trainer Shoe has always felt great, however I have concern over its' ability to hold up through heavy mileage. Performs well on most runs. I would also like to see a reduced weight and heel drop.",
110215,3,06/23/2016,"Great shoes besides some blister issues Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of Brooks shoes and my favorite shoes are the Launch 2's, so I had high hopes for the Launch 3's. The new styling of the upper looks cooler than the 2's and I like the kaleidoscope colors. Unfortunately, I have minor to moderate blistering on one of my feet every time I wear the 3's. The blistering happens on the bottom of my big toe and on the bottom of my foot near the toe joints. This never happened with the 2's and I still wear my 2's when I want to have a give my feet a break. I have been playing around with the tightness of the laces to see if I can improve the issue, but I have found that going for runs longer than 10 miles in the heat can cause the blistering. I'm guessing it's the fit of the 3's, but I haven't had to work so hard to avoid blisters.  I really wanted to love these shoes because they have a smooth ride and feel comfortable when I run in them. I will continue to wear them, but don't feel confident using them for a half or full marathon distance.",
110215,5,06/10/2016,"300 miles and still going Have been running in Ghosts the last few years and wanted something lighter but, still need some cushion.  The Launch 3 has been great.  Right out of the box I ran 16 miles in them with no problems.  Wore them on all my long runs while training for a marathon.  I read reviews about the narrow toe box.  My foot is narrow so, they fit me well.  Just make sure you try them on first...like you should for any other shoe before you buy them.",
110215,4,06/10/2016,"Comfortable shoe I originally ordered the same size that I wear the pure flow 4.  I had to send them back and get a half size larger.  this is due to a little narrower feel, but mainly the more rigid toe strap on the Launch 3.",
110215,5,06/09/2016,Overall Very Satisfied Ill preface this review with these are the first pair of brooks running shoes I purchased and I am almost guaranteed to be a repeat customer form now on. Right from the start you can tell Brooks has confidence in their products based on the return policy. Shipping was also super quick which was great. I run around 3-4 times a week and am building up my base from around 12 miles a week to around 25 to run a half in the fall and these shoes have been perfect for me for the past month. I would highly recommend them.,
110215,5,06/07/2016,"Even better than Launch 2 I have had the Launch 3 for about a month now after having ran in the Launch 2 for a year or so. The 3's are even lighter and a little more sleek than previous year, with incredible breathability. Very comfortable, not trading the support for looks/weight. I promptly ran 6 miles after getting them, which is just a testament to their effective design, ready to use right out of the box. Only cons I can think of are that running in the rain would get a bit soggy, but duh, and if you need lots of support you might want a more meaty shoe. Love these buggers.",
110215,5,06/02/2016,"Great shoe period I love this shoe, I recently had a knee injury and I switched from the St5 Racer(a great shoe as well) for more cushion and I am nothing but pleased with this choice.",
110215,3,06/01/2016,"My Favorite is just Good Still a great shoe. Fits well, has great traction, and helps me through each run. I think I was expecting a little bit more forefoot cushioning.",
110215,4,05/25/2016,Fit great from the second i laced them up ,
110215,4,05/20/2016,"So far, so good! I run cross country; around 4 miles per day. I bought these specific Brooks as a replacement to a couple pairs I returned due the tread falling apart. The Launch 3's are holding up great so far. Super comfortable.",
110215,5,05/20/2016,"comfortable and true to size For the last several years I've run in shoes from the Brooks PureConnect and the Racer series and wanted to get a shoe that has slightly more cushioning. The Launch 3 was exactly that - it is very comfortable though not too much heavier or bulkier than the PuerConnect. I'm still getting used to running in a shoe with thicker sole as I don't feel I have the same traction/grip with the running surface as before. I'm 6'3, 190 lbs 37 year-old that logs 20-25 miles a week and typically at 7:30-8:00 min/mile pace.",
110215,5,05/19/2016,great running shoes! ordered online because I was previously running with Brooks. They are very comfortable and great cushion with my last race! I wish I ordered a half size smaller but otherwise great.,
110215,5,05/11/2016,First neutral running shoe...best comfort Use for functional training and sprints. Neutral sole feels natural to the foot. Best shoe I've had in years. Definitely will purchase another pair.,
110215,4,05/08/2016,"First Time Brooks buy Great running shoe and first time using Brooks shoes. First pair I bought was rubbing the back of my heal causing blisters. I brought the shoes back into Brooks, and they were great exchanging a new pair to make sure it wasn't just a the one pair. After the exchange I haven't had any issues with the shoes and they fit comfortably. The only major complaint beyond the fit of the shoe are the color combinations, which are rather boring, but that won't stop me from trying another pair of Brooks running shoes in the future. Really love the Brooks Flagship Seattle Store, great employees and awesome 90 day return policy. I'll probably try some different models in the future to see if i'll stick with the Launch series or not.",
110215,5,05/07/2016,Great shoes! ,
110215,5,05/05/2016,"Nice fit and weight for race day! Bought them to compliment my Ghost 8's on long runs and tempo days in prep for race season. A little snug in the toes upfront but 50 miles in, they feel great.",
110215,5,05/02/2016,"Highly recommend I recently switched over to these from the Ravenna 7's. I tend to under pronate so needed something with more flexibility through the arch and cushion on the outside. Just ran a half in these, and no pain whatsoever. Agreed with other reviews that a little tight in the toebox, which is why I ended up with a 1/2 size larger than normal. Overall, very impressed with these shoes after being somewhat frustrated with my Ravenna's.",
110215,3,05/02/2016,Not the Best I bought these shoes with hope of running a lot in them because they had some good reviews. but once I started to run in them I noticed some bad things. it fits good but my pinky toe rubs and it hurts it while I run. also I feel like there wasn't much support for the balls of me feet when I do sprints or run fast. it is a shoe meant for heal to toe runners I think. I would return them within the 90 days and get a new pair like the glycerin 12 but I am deployed so I don't really have that option right now. not the worst shoe I have ran in but I didn't like them.,
110215,5,04/27/2016,Light and comfortable I was wearing the ghost and thought this might be a little light but overall great cushioning especially for a mid strike runner. Quick shoe.,

I alternate between the Brooks Ghost for runs longer than 16 miles, and the Launch for shorter runs and speed work. I find the Launch to be durable enough for Half Marathons, responsive enough for Tempo Runs, and fast/light for speed repeats. A solid shoe, good update from the Launch 2.",
110215,5,04/26/2016,I'm completely satisfied with the Launch 3. Great Shoe.:-) These shoes are great for running events. I broke my old 2 mile PR last week in these shoes and I'm going to make this shoe my choice for each race I participate in. These shoes certainly works well with my style of running. I couldn't be happier. Thanks Brooks for producing the Launch 3.:-),
110215,5,04/22/2016,Very light shoes Those shoes are awesome. Way better than the over-cushionned bricks I used to run with. I just think it might lack of cushion for anything longer than a half marathon.,
110215,4,04/20/2016,"Great shoe with some minor miscues I only run at the gym on a treadmill and this shoe works great for that. I would recommend first wearing them in a bit (using them for a week or two) and then purchasing an extra insole to make them extra comfortable. I always do this with all my brooks running shoes. All-in-all it's a great shoe, but it seems to wear out quickly. Some of the stitching is starting to come off and I've only had the shoe for a month or so. I can't really tell if it's because of how I used it or because it's just a bad batch (the stitching is only coming off on one shoe). Also, I used to have a problem with some of the plastic scratching my pinky toes and causing an abrasion on the toes. I haven't had this problem with this shoe which is great! I would definitely recommend.",
110215,5,04/20/2016,"Perfect -- Brooks does it again! Wore Ghost 7 for the longest time, till they were completely worn out. Launch 3 has a better feel to them compared to the Ghosts. More supportive, better toe fit, better cushioning, feels responsive, great looking! Weight is ideal. Really happy with them. Gonna reorder!",
110215,3,04/19/2016,6mm offset please! 6mm offset please! This would also save a bit of weight. Wouldn't mind a wider toebox as well.,
110215,3,04/19/2016,"one or two changes for the perfect shoe This shoe is too narrow and a tad too cushioned/heavy.I like the outsole how it is. It seems to me if Brooks took the overall stack height down a bit, but mostly the heel (maybe to a 6mm drop), this would be both lighter and more responsive. As previous reviewers have said shoe is also quite narrow, just open the upper over the medial flare.Please listen like you did before Brooks!",
110215,5,04/19/2016,"My favorite for training and racing I had been running in the Ravenna for a while since I ever so slightly over pronate. The Ravenna is a great shoe. But I wanted to try a neutral Brooks shoe and when the Launch 2 came in a Boston Edition I was a sucker for the look. After a week of break-in, the Launch 2 felt like it was made for my feet and has been great for recovery runs, speed work, long runs, and races from a 10K to a full marathon. It's been a workhorse and I grabbed a backup pair on sale. Now that it's time for a third pair I grabbed the Launch 3 Tokyo Dragon and everything I said about the Launch 2 applies to the Launch 3. If there are changes, I can't really feel them. I just hope Brooks doesn't deviate from the formula with the Launch 4. The Launch 2 and 3 feel awesome, aren't too expensive, and provide good mileage for me.",
110215,4,04/11/2016,"Great shoe, comfortable Very comfortable.  Took them out of the box and ran 8 miles and then 16 mile with no blisters or pains.  The toe box does seem to come to too much of a point and I have a narrow foot.  Sizing on your website says it has the same sizing as Ghost 8.  I believe the pointier toe makes it fit about 1/2 size smaller.  Other possible con is that the area under the toe where I toe-off seems to already be wearing quickly at only 85 miles",

110215,5,04/07/2016,"BEST RUNNING/WALKING/JOGGING SHOES EVER! I purchased the Launch 3 Running Shoe for my husband who was disappointed in the last 2 pair of running shoes (not Brooks) that I had purchased for him. The last 2 pair felt promising for about the first 2  months but after a few 6+ mile jog/runs, they turned out to not hold up to their hype. I visited the Brooks website and read description after description of running shoes until I found one that seemed to fit the bill... the Launch 3. My husband swears that these are the best shoes that he has ever worn... period. Not only does he wear the Launch 3 for his jog/runs (4+ times a week/6+ miles each) but also when we're just out and about or when he's traveling and has to trek through the airport. If you're looking for a running shoe that cradles your feet in comfort as well as holds up to pounding the pavement, then you should try the Launch 3. My husband thanks me for finding these running shoes every time that he puts them on.",
110215,5,04/07/2016,Great Shoe I always buy Brooks for running.  I run cross country in the fall and track in the spring.  Brooks fit my feet the best and provide the competitive edge I need.,
110215,5,04/01/2016,"Awesome Great shoe. I've been a Ghost fan but had to upgrade to plusher Glycerine while nursing post marathon tendon - also a great shoe but heavier on shorter runs. Not wanting a second shoe so close, I went to Launch for something light and responsive and it delivers. Shoe feels feather light but is still supportive. Have not gone over 7 in them, but would be comfortable doing so.",
110215,4,03/30/2016,"Switched from pure flow Reviews on the pure flow were not good this year.  Had a friend that bought the pure flow and sent them back.  He bought the launch 3 and described them as ""running in slippers"" they were so comfortable.  Took me a couple times to get used to them, but like them now.  Rigid but not stiff, soft but you don't feel every pebble.",
110215,4,03/30/2016,Love Them! I have been wearing Ravenna's for the past three years and I wasn't thrilled with the latest model (6's) so I tried the Launch. I've put about 20-30 miles on them so far and they are great! Definitely not as much support as the Ravenna but it has not been an issue for me.,
110215,4,03/29/2016,My second pair. First pair got a lot of indoor track training thiswinter.  Heels wore thru black soles pretty quickly (< 500 mi.),
110215,4,03/29/2016,Good update Good shoe for short (5K) and long (1/2 marathon) distances and multi sport (duathlon and triathlon). My only complaint is they could be ventilated a little better.,
110215,4,03/24/2016,"sweet ride I'm 64 and the cushioning is great and it's still light and responsive. I love it. Most shoes get improved until they harm them but these are great right now for me. Lots of support, light and make you feel fast, even at 64.",
110215,5,03/24/2016,Great comfort and style This shoe is awesome. Great fit and very comfortable. Perfect value for your money.,
110215,5,03/21/2016,"Exactly as expected I go for 3-5mi road runs at least 3 times a week.  I have a pair of the Launch 2 I am still a huge fan of.  For a little while I had been thinking I needed another pair, so I don't wear a hole in the bottom of my older pair.  I got a notification about the limited release kaleidoscope and decided to pull the trigger.  I love them just as much as the previous version.One thing I've noticed is that the upper material, likely specific to the kaleidoscope versions, seems a little bit less ""breathable"" probably due to the print that needed to be applied.  I use quotes around breathable because I don't think that's the appropriate word, it's still a very lightweight material just seems more rigid than the mesh upper on the Launch 2.",

110215,5,03/17/2016,"Launch 3 fits and feels even better than the perfect L2! I run printing equipment. I don't run for the sake of running (besides a Hash once in awhile), I prefer cycling. So my review is based on walking an average of 8-10 miles a day, inside on concrete floors 12 hours a day, 7 days a week during my company's peak periods. Traction, support, breathability, light weight, and cushioning are of utmost importance while I'm working. Lifting heavy boxes of stock in 85 degree heat, constantly walking around to keep the machines ""singing"" for a month at time, 3-4 times a year, I've come to learn a lot about good shoes and bad shoes. I've tried a couple dozen different brands and types of shoes over the decades, and The Launch by Brooks is The One, period. I wish they lasted for 5 years, but then again they most likely would not be the same shoe (i.e.: The GTS is a more durable, yet not as comfortable shoe) My Launch 2's are a year old, and do not show the same signs of wear (broken sections in the mesh uppers, worn down souls) as my previous models of Brooks. The 2's still feel great on my feet, and I will continue to wear them, alternating with my 3's. I bought the Launch 3's just today, so I can't really review the 3's, but they felt great when I slipped them on, and the soul looks identical to the 2's, so I'm positive they will give this tired old man a lift tomorrow morning at work! Me, my feet, and my back want to thank the Brooks employees for really caring for the customers needs. Your shoes and really all of your products have made my life a much more comfortable one.",
110215,5,03/16/2016,Fun shoe Love the limited edition shoes and wait eagerly for more in the Launch series,
110215,4,03/15/2016,Good Shoe ,
110215,5,03/14/2016,"Light and speedy Ordered these on a lark via the Brooks email list; loved the design (Tokyo color scheme) and needed a new pair of lightweight racers. These are great for my uses: road and track running, road racing. I wouldn't take them on a trail, even a packed gravel or bike path. Too lightweight. Also, beware of puddles; they soak through quickly.",

I have never found (and am confident that I never will) a shoe that works for every aspect of training/living. This shoe, when used properly, ranks in my top 3 all-time. What is its proper use?The Launch is NOT an everyday trainer.The Launch is NOT an aggressive 5k/10k racing flat.The Launch is a lightweight training shoe designed for uptempo kinds of efforts, such as tempo/threshold runs or perhaps long races (half marathon or marathon).It is also not designed for casual heel-striking jaunts about the concrete jungle.I thoroughly believe that the Launch should be a part of every runner's collection (and the Launch 3 is better still than the previous iterations!). Use it properly, and it will take great care of you.",
110215,5,02/28/2016,"Brooks' Launch 3 I'm 5'10"" & 160lbs and in the gym 3X/week doing strength training and cardio during the winter months. As a person with low arches, I always thought I needed stability in a running shoe, which is not necessarily true! So, a couple of years ago I switched to a neutral running shoe.I came across the Brooks Launch 3, quite by accident, while doing an online search for a lightweight, cushioning shoe. Wow, Brooks really ""knocked it out of the park"" with this shoe. I didn't realize they made a truly lightweight cushioned shoe. To date, not having run outdoors, I can't attest to the shoes durability on the road, trail or wet weather, but in the gym its been excellent. I've put about 50-75 miles on the shoe, to date. It's one sweet lightweight, cushioned running shoe with plenty of room in the toe box with lightly cushioned or thin running socks.   If purchasing this shoe, as with most running shoes, you'll need to size-up 1/2 size for a proper fit. Enjoy the ride!",
110215,4,02/26/2016,"Fantastic fit and Ride, but heel durability terrible Awesome Shoe for speed days. Tempo, Hills, Etc. Perfect fit.I LOVE the simple lacing.The midsole is not too soft or too firm. Brooks nails that sweet spot. Fairly responsive. Love this shoe, however...For the next generation of Launch I would like to see it lose a little weight. Perhaps making the upper more of an ""open"" mesh. The ""only"" negative I have, and it's kind of a big one is the durability in the heel. As a heel striker I am seeing significant wear just after about 10 miles. The rubber in the heel is too thin and I would love to see Brooks come up with a more durable rubber compound in the heel. Plus the rubber is segmented back there. I would make the heel wear area solid. I will continue to wear the Launch because it feels great while running.Keep up the great work, Brooks!",
110215,5,02/23/2016,"Fun Shoe Like these shoes a lot. Ran in the Launch 2 for about a year and decided to upgrade. Wish the toe box was a bit wider like the Ghosts, but that may just be my feet. They are definitively streamlined and have a nice light feel.",

110215,5,01/28/2016,"Love these! My husband needs a sneaker with a high and roomy toe box that also laces shut nice and snug. These are perfect! They fit great and have great bounce and are very comfortable. Great sneaker for miles on the trails. They look great, too!",
110215,5,01/20/2016,Love These Shoes! My ideal running shoe is one that I don't have to think or worry about while I am running. This shoe made me completely forget about it during my 1st run & I finished tired but elated. So far have only gone 6 miles at any one time but plan to wear them in a half-marathon in a few weeks.,
110215,4,01/16/2016,"Lots of things to like, couple possible concerns As a avid user of the original Launch, I hoarded several pairs when they discontinued them.  Alas, while I had a pair of Launch 2's, I never had the chance to wear them before they were no more and exchanged them for these on what was apparently Day 1 (January 1).  After about 60 miles in them, they're quite nice.  I've had a little problem with some rubbing on the outside top of the foot and the heel, but I can't guarantee it's the shoe.  All said, it's a slightly softer ride, still very lightweight, and close enough to the original to still be my shoe.  Will need to pay close attention to the fabric/rubbing issue to see if this is a manufacturing issue.",
110217,5,12/22/2017,Great running shoe I just got into running and my goal is to PR in 5K events. These shoes feel great with good support and a lot of cushion that hugs my heel! I've put less than 25 miles on them so far. So far so good!!,

I am very happy I did.  I find the Ravenna to be much lighter and comfortable.  The only difference I've noticed is that I only get around 350 miles/pair versus the 400 miles/pair that I got out of the Adrenaline.  Unrelated - I was in Seattle and had the opportunity to run through Ravenna Park.  I thought it would be cool to wear my Ravenna shoes in Ravenna Park.  I'm glad I did it, but the park was underwhelming.",
110217,5,11/22/2017,Very comfortable for Achilles The extra padding in the back of the shoe is great for people like me with injuries at the Achilles insertion point (back of the heel). Very comfortable and glad I found them online as I couldn't in dozens of stores.,

I absolutely loved the 6's, but the 7's seem to run large and my feet slap down a little when running even though I ordered the same size. I suppose that's the price you pay for having large feet and fewer size options. Other than size, they seemed to be very similar to my 6's. They were a little chunky in the heel but very well constructed and will stand up to high mileage training quite well. I ended up returning these (for free-Thanks Brooks!) and buying a pair of the Ravenna 8's at my local running store so I could try them on. #ReviewSweeps",

I was surprised to find MORE support here than the adrenaline series, which is great if you need it! Less cushion than adrenalines as expected, and definitely more spring with each toe-off. I returned because these run a bit narrow, and caused blistering on both feet after 3 miles consistently on 4 runs, and the support provided was too much.

110217,3,07/07/2017,"They're good shoes. but..... My sophomore year of cross country I got a pair of Ravenna 6s in transition from Asics gel-cumulus.  I had a breakout season with these shoes. I cut my 5k times from high 21s down to mid 18s in a single season.  After years of knee problems, I finally had a season with only shin splints.  The, for track I got a pair of the 7s.  I wore a 9.5 in the 6s, but 9.5 seemed much longer in the 7s.  The shoes almost feel clunky.  The toe box feels wide and the impact area where i strike (the ball of my foot) is hard to land on.  They are too long and narrow.  I have had some minor ankle problems with these shoes, and shin splints, and I can honestly say I want the 6s back.  This may be too late, but for the next model, use the midsole and platform of the 6s and update the upper.  I think the upper mesh can be improved greatly, and keeping the platform and midsole of the 6 makes my run feel more natural.",
110217,5,07/06/2017,Best Buy Ever My husband always ends up going back to the Ravennas.He said that they have the best support on ALL surfaces.,
110217,5,07/05/2017,Very Comfortable ,
110217,5,06/28/2017,"On my third pair and looking at ordering a couple more!!!! I started with the Ravenna V and they fit ok.  Once I had worn them out, they had already switched to the Ravenna VII model.  I bought one pair and they were even more comfortable than the Vs.  So I ordered a second pair.I'm looking at buying a couple more pairs before they change models to the number 8...  These shoes are better than any Asics I have worn, including the Asics Nimbus.  It feels like I could run forever!!!",
110217,5,06/26/2017,"Love em! I am an endurance runner so I run 25 miles or so per week all year except when I am training for a marathon then I will go up to double that so I really need a shoe that will support my foot and be comfortable, I think this is it. I have tried many other brands and they all change to a less supportive shoe over time so I wind up trying a bunch of different shoes. No one ever told me about the Ravenna but I saw it on your website when I did a compare so I decided to give it a run. I was totally surprised at how good this shoe is.",
110217,5,06/23/2017,Ravennas are my Favorite Running Shoe I love these shoes. I've been running in Ravennas for about 4 years now and I won't wear any other running shoe. They're great stability shoes.,
110217,5,06/18/2017,Fantastic shoe Very comfortable and supportive shoe. I am not a runner but have enjoyed theses shoes and they make me feel like running and enjoy it.,

110217,5,06/17/2017,"Need a wider toe box? This shoe is for you! I have flat feet & over pronation is an issue. These shoes, without inserts, provide all the support I need. And they have a wider toe box than the Ravenna V's. I no longer have any foot, ankle, knee or lower back pain.",

110217,4,06/09/2017,"I have only been buying the Ravenna series for a few years. I use these for work in a hospital. Nonstop walking 40hrs a week. The last 2 pairs have torn pretty quickly, I have high hopes for this pair. Looks like there's been some added support in those areas of the toe area to prevent tearing.",
110217,2,06/08/2017,"Returns Have loved the Adrenaline GTS 15/16 for three seasons, but could not find them in my size so thought of trying the Ravenna 7s and they were HUGE comparably- a generous thumb beyond the big toe. Back to looking for GTS 16 or 17 now, I suppose!",
110217,5,05/11/2017,I like it ,
110217,2,05/09/2017,Not what I was hoping for Wider fore foot and loose in the heel make it uncomfortable fit for running. Good traction but support is leaving something to be desired.,

Not really a runner, nor do I enjoy running, but that being said I think this is a comfortable shoe that feels good to run in for me, the amateur runner. Have only really run once a week for about a couple months on an outdoor track (no trails or road). I also now use as my indoor gym shoe. I like them.",

110217,4,03/30/2017,"Another solide shoe in the Ravenna Family Tree Great shoe!  They started out a bit stiff, but they are breaking in ok.  For some reason they feel heavy, but that is 100% subjective.  But the objective weight is fine....might be wearer issue!",
110217,3,03/27/2017,Not what I was looking for. I usually buy the Adrenaline's but liked the color and price so thought I would try these.  I usually wear a 13 with my other Brooks but had to get a 12 in these.  Just don't feel the same support as a do for the Adrenaline's.,

Your wide width are like NARROW.  I have been a  9 1/2  medium  my whole adult life and neither your normal or wide width fit.   You won't be in business much longer if you can't get the sizes right.  For on-line orders the rule is  ""2 strikes and you're out""Sorry.",

110217,5,03/14/2017,I liked it so much I bought a second pair. ,
110217,5,03/07/2017,Yes I would purchase again ,

110217,1,02/01/2017,"awful cushioning not sure why you would change something that works like the Ravenna 6 , these Ravenna 7 are awful, horrible cushioning, had awful pain in my legs.......overall very poor shoe, dont change something that works...",
110217,5,02/01/2017,"Very comfortable with excellent support. These shoes are a huge improvement over the nike free runs I used to run with. These provide very solid arch support and cushioning for your run. After running in these for almost a year, I never feel any foot pain and they are still very much intact. Some people say they are too narrow, but I disagree. They fit just right for me, but it might be because I got a half size bigger. Getting a half size bigger in running shoes is good anyway, because your feet need to move around a little bit.",
110217,5,01/10/2017,"Great Product I'm a 3-season high school runner that runs between about 20 miles a week, depending on the workout.  I got these shoes at the start of the cross country season, and they worked out great!  It has great support for running on every surface and in all weather.  Though they are a bit heavy, I'm fine with it, since I use this as a training shoe and use lighter flats in races.  The size fits well and I've run 350 miles in them and are still holding up strong.  A great move up from the Ravenna 6's.",
110217,1,11/26/2016,Not as good as the 5's The Ravenna's have gotten progressively narrower since the 5s.   Can't wear these anymore. Will probably transition to New balance 860's.  Wish I had read the reviews beforehand.,
110217,5,11/14/2016,"the Best. I have used Brooks since my days in the Navy.  Thats about 16 years. I don't use any other brand, absolutely love the Ravenna.  Incredible response, great running outside on the roads, cushioned very well I'm 6'4 237lbs so its great for tall men.  I always just buy the next available Ravenna.....always an excellent ride.",
110217,2,10/18/2016,"Uncomfortably tight - had to return for another style I've used the R.6 for hundreds of miles and worn them until they are falling apart. I've tried to find another R6 but had to purchase the R7 as the R6's are no longer available. They're to tight around the top of my foot and the right shoe hurts the top of my foot so bad that after a 9 mile run, I could barely walk for 2 days. I've tried loosening the shoe strings but it doesn't help. I'm returning them and hoping that the next generation will be like the R6. Lesson learned......when you find something that works, buy 3 pair!!!",
110217,2,10/11/2016,"A great shoe that is now too narrow and tight for my feet I had the Brooks Ravenna 5 which was one of the best and most comfortable shoes I ever had. The great arch support helped with my flat feet and plantar fasciitis. I bought the Ravenna 7 based on the great experience I had with the 5. Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the reviews that the shoes are too narrow and tight near the front making them uncomfortable to wear. I was forced to return them as they felt uncomfortable even after breaking them in.  I hope that Brooks fixes this in the next iteration of this shoe.",
110217,4,10/03/2016,"tight fit for size wear these mostly for walking and cross training.  wear well once broke in and stretch out a bit, as they are uncomfortably tight when new especially over the toes and top of foot.  Have to wear very loosely tied for the first few weeks of use, then they become a comfortable shoe.  I wish they would fit a bit better out of the box.",

110217,3,09/12/2016,Not so great Left shoe either not same fit or stubbornly does not want to break-in. Very uncomfortable and I may just get rid of this set. I probably have owned 20 or more pairs of your shoes and this is the first that has been unsatisfactory.,
110217,4,08/26/2016,"Don't let the ""too narrow"" comments scare you I've owned the past 2 versions (5 & 6) and now 7.  I really liked version 5, but for me the 6 felt too bulky and padded around the ankles.  I took a chance on Version 7 and was pleasantly surprised with how nice the shoe feels.  The bulky-ness is gone in 7 and the shoe has a nice supple feel and decent response.  I do feel a slight narrow-ness in the toe box compared to the past 2 versions, but for me it's subtle and it hasn't bothered me in the slightest.  I use this shoe as an everyday trainer, but would not recommend it for races.",
110217,4,08/24/2016,great shoe but too narrow ,
110217,1,08/04/2016,"Too tight After purchasing the Ravenna 4, 5 and 6s, I went right to the 7s without hesitation. Immediately upon trying them out for a run, I realized that I would have to tie these shoes differently - loosely. Too tight, and I have pain on the outside of my feet and ankles within a 1/2 mile of running. I really hope the Ravenna 8s revert back to previous style. This was a great shoe. More colors options would be nice too.",
110217,4,07/12/2016,Shoe a little too narrow The only drawback of this shoe is that it is too narrow (based on the standard width shoe).  It would be perfect if it was just a little wider.,
110217,5,07/08/2016,"Feels Better than Last Years Ravenna 6 I put around 25-30 miles per week in.  Long run usually around 12-15 miles each week.  I use the older Ravenna 6 for my short and medium runs, then I use the newer Ravenna 7 for the long runs.  I read that they have the same technology in both shoes, however for some reason I feel that the 7's are more comfy for the long runs.  Maybe it's just me, who knows.  But I am happy to have found a good mix of alternating a couple pairs of Brooks.  On another quick note, I originally purchased the Ghost 8's.  There was a small area of stitching on the instep that was really grinding my foot, causing a lot of discomfort and minor injury.  I called Brooks and they TOTALLY took care of the problem right away.  I simply returned the Ghost 8's and turned around and bought the Ravenna's that I am more familiar with.  Brooks customer service is absolutely fantastic and they stand behind every single inch of every shoe.So grateful for a great company that has a great culture and great product.",
110217,2,07/04/2016,"Narrower fit then previous versions I have been using Ravenna for last 4 years, and Ravenna 5 and 6 worked well for me, didn't like the fit of Ravenna 7, its feels stiff, narrow and little longer in size compared to the previous versions, hope Books brings back the fit from versions 5 and 6...",

110217,1,04/08/2016,"Why change something when it was so good? I have had Ravenna 4, 5 and 6 and with each transition this model only got better.  I naturally moved to the 7 when it was released.  Two 11km runs and I had to see my chiro after each. These runners were so different I felt like I had gone from the most cushioned runner to a barefoot one - it was that bad.  I was fortunate enough to be able to return them and had to transition to Hoka One One as no other Brooks model suited my foot.  I feel gutted.  I am running my first marathon soon and have to start training over to get used to this whole new shoe.  Why did you change this so much - I was a Brooks die hard but you lost me now.  It is a sad sad day.",
110217,3,04/07/2016,"Time to reflect 1) The first 60 miles in this shoe was not good. The top lacing pattern is changed slightly from the 6 and it caused a hard crease which bruised the top of my foot. So I put them away for a bit...until my bruise went away.2) Others have mentioned how narrow they are, but I have a narrow foot and that's one of the strong points of Ravennas, I actually have some adjustability.3) Since my foot has healed up, I played with the laces a bit and have put about 50 - 60 miles in these with no more top foot pain. While I like the overall fit (except for the front laces), it feels like this Ravenna is almost TOO soft/cushiony. I thought the 6 was spot on.4) It's almost as if, I'm ""breaking in"" these 7's and that's something I've not had to do before with Ravenna's. 5) I'll probably muddle thru the Spring with these and perhaps pick up a pair of Launch 3's later this Summer, then hold out hope for the Ravenna 8's.6) I would recommend these to someone coming over from, say Adrenaline's, but experienced Ravenna wearers should be ready to do some tweaking to get these right.",
110217,5,03/12/2016,"Perfect shoe for me I got fitted for these by my local running shop after sustaining a torn flexor and stress fracture over consecutive years in my old brand, which I loved. I continue to buy them now because they feel and perform better than anything else I've ever run in. I only do about 15 miles a week with a 10K thrown about once a quarter but I do love these shoes. I say I would recommend these to a friend, but only if the friend were just like me, there might be a model more suited for them, would definitely recommend the brand.",

The Ravenna 6 had issues with the toe box stitching and while this is corrected in the 7, the fit is much more narrow and stiff.

Worked with knowledgeable staff to find various shoes that might be right for me - 6'4"", 220 lbs., slight pronation.  I considered many different brands.  It came down to the Ravenna 7 and another shoe.  Ran in both on the treadmill.  I liked both, and decided on the Ravenna 7.  I am glad I did.  Comfortable right out of the box.

110225,4,08/28/2017,"Solid shoe, minor irritation. Recommended with reservations. I bought this shoe after my old shoes gave out while I'm prepping for a half marathon. Even though it's not really important I really like the look of this shoe, functionally this shoe offers great support and I like the way it supports my feet as I run. Now for the downside, the tongue. For some reason this shoe uses a completely different material for the tongue then the rest of the shoe. It is very stiff and fairly thick and because of this it has a large seam area where it is connected to the shoe right on top of the foot, this leads to rubbing and possibly chaffing. The tongue also has no loop for the laces to go through so it tends to wander which increases discomfort at the seam area. The tongue material underside also seems to stick to socks as opposed to sliding smoothly leading to more rubbing, this effect seems to decrease the time I spend in the shoes.I am going to put I would recommend this shoe but it is with reservations.",
110225,3,07/20/2017,"Nice shoe... but. I like the appearance of the shoe, but be careful, the shoe run about 1/4 - 1/2 size small. They seem narrow too. I wear a 9 in the Transcend with no problem, but not so in this shoe.",

110225,3,03/03/2017,Liked earlier versions better. The toe box is a little tight.  Also - the shoe tongue below the bottom lace eyelets is stiff.  I loved the old Green Silence wrap over tongue design - could you incorporate into the Pure Series?  There is also not as much cushion at the back of the shoe where it touches your Achilles.,
110225,4,03/02/2017,"Prefer the two piece tongue design I don't care for the update that has an independent tongue. Otherwise, this is a great shoe. It has a bit of support in a minimalist, light weight shoe. Then I add my custom orthotics to it.",
110225,2,01/26/2017,major disappointment I have worn every version since its inception. Love the Purecadence! Now this. the heel retention just digs into my Achilles.  the base of the tongue left sores and tore skin because it pinches and digs into the top of your foot at the toes.  Every other version out of the box were wonderful.  could go sockless. So now I get to return these and try another brand.,
110225,1,01/15/2017,"What have you done with my PureCadence 4? I always read user reviews but tend never to write them...but after my latest incidence with the purecadence 5, I had to say something.  For my last marathon training cycle I alternated between the PureFlow 4 for my track workouts and racing, and the Purecadence 4 for a bit more support on my long runs.  They were PERFECT.  Bought 3 pairs of each.  Read the bad reviews for the updated versions on both and, reluctantly, switched my track/race shoe to a different brand.  Not wanting to give up on my love for Brooks, I went ahead and bought a pair of the purecadence 5.  I cannot believe how different this shoe is.  I broke the shoe in over a couple of weeks but it never got better. The upper is so stiff. The tongue of the shoe was grinding my anterior tibialis tendon  giving me tendinitis there.  I have MAD blood blisters on the medial side of my 1st metatarsal and also across the top of my feet.  As if tendinitis in one spot isn't bad enough, the narrow fit also caused peroneal  tendinitis on the lateral aspect of my foot.  Took 5 days off from running and ditched the pureCadence and feeling much better.....but i'm left wondering ....Will i ever #RunHappy with Brooks again?",
110225,1,11/06/2016,"rUN Happy...  :( Ordered the PureProject Cadence 5's in enough time to incorporate them into my build-up for the Dublin Marathon. I am an avid Brooks fan and the Cadence 4's are fantastic. I was excited to try the 5's, and equally disappointed by mile 3...Most notably the seam where the tongue connects to the toe vamp curls into the top of the foot and causes the tongue to slide to the outer side. I thought I might just need to warm them up or break them in. However, I actually had to go back to my Cadence 4's for the race and run through the bruising caused by the poor construction of this shoe.",
110225,2,10/19/2016,"Serious design flaw in tongue The tongue was off center and stiff.  It caused rubbing and pain at ankle.  In order to wear the shoe, I cut off the end of the tongue and taped it.  I don't understand the stupidity of the design.  I would not buy this shoe again.",
110225,5,10/12/2016,Love my new PureCadence 5's I have slightly wide feet that are usually difficult to fit unless the shoe comes in widths.  I was skeptical when the Brooks website recommended this specific shoe that did not come in widths and it was also my first try at ordering shoes online.  I was and am amazed by the great fit and improvement in my gait.  I hate to take them off.,
110225,5,10/11/2016,"Great comfort and cushion This shoe is great. I love the comfort and stability. It is light and it has great traction. The left tongue has given me some problems. For some reason, it rubs my ankle and it has caused a blister. When I received the shoe, show sole was a little bit tough. But, it gets smooth during my training",
110225,3,10/03/2016,"Bit of a downgrade from PureCadence 4 Great for a marathon. However, by the time you get some runs in them, then run the race, the life of these shoes are just about done. I loved the 4's, but these are a little bit of a step back. Don't feel as much cushion. I've also gotten blisters on the top of my feet, which I see is pretty common.",
110225,4,10/01/2016,"Great Quality Running Shoe I'm training for my second marathon and have trusted these shoes for the few years that I've been seriously running distance. My comments are that they start to wear out at around 400-500 miles, which is pretty typical, so I just buy another pair. Another aspect of the new design on the Pure Cadence 5 is the tongue design. I like that the tongue is smooth on top to work well with the new laces, for ease of lacing and unlacing quickly. I notice that with low profile running socks the edge of the new tongue irritates the top of my foot. In previous designs there was more cushion around the inside of the tongue, but in the Pure Cadence 5 it feels a bit more rigid and forced me to wear higher socks.",
110225,1,09/30/2016,"Miss the old style I really, really liked the old style which fit my feet like great socks.  If Brooks could combine the old structure of the shoe with newer design/colors I would happily buy them again.  As they are now, I had to return them due to poor fit.  Sorry, I like your company, but need better shoe.  Sometimes change for the sake of change is s step backwards.",
110225,3,09/09/2016,"Hoping for a change if they make a #6 I've been using the Pure Cadence line since it's inception and have been very happy with the shoe up until this point.  Top issues:  1) Fit - my feet are tough and are not quick to blister, but I've been getting hot spots and blisters in places I never have before on my feet.  2) There's more rubbery material on this shoe - I don't think it breaths as well.  3) seems heavier, but have not weighed it or looked at stats.  Just feels heavier to me.  Hope for a change in the next version or I'll have to move on.",
110225,4,09/08/2016,"Close to perfect I've recently started running more than just required for PT tests, and so far I really like these shoes. They're very comfortable and light weight.Only downside, and this might have more to do with me not running a lot, is that it pinches the little toes a little and has given me some minor blisters. Easily dealt with temporarily with bandaids and I imagine my toes will adjust eventually.Note: I have to concentrate to notice the pinching, probably wouldn't have noticed at all if I hadn't gotten the blisters.",
110225,2,09/07/2016,"Bring back Version 2 I've been an avid runner and racer for over 25 years. I currently run 25 to 50 miles a week depending on upcoming races. During that time, I've run in over a dozen different running shoes from most of the big shoe companies.  For about 3 years, the PureCadence has been my goto shoe. Unfortunately, over time, the PureCadence line has progressively become more like an average traditional running shoe.  While it's still relatively light, it no longer has a connected road feel without interference from overly-constructed heel padding. Also gone is the supple upper and flexible quiet sole.  Version 5 is too narrow in the too box and has far to much flare on the heel pad.  I gave them a try but ultimately returned them for some Cadence 4s.  I've worn out the 4s and had to switch to another brand.  Please bring back version 2 of the PureCadence!",
110225,3,08/25/2016,"Not great Owned every generation in the cadence line, since first gen each consecutive version has gotten worse, notably after gen3Used to be my favorite line, will not buy again unless some of the old features are brought back",
110225,5,08/14/2016,my son loves them these shoes were for my son. he runs cross country for his college. Brooks shoes is all he runs in.,
110225,4,08/09/2016,"Much better than expected Since version 1, the PureCadence has been my go-to daily trainer for marathon and half marathon training. I put ~20-30 miles/week in these shoes, generally for my easy miles and long runs, and have run in every version. v1 was my favorite, with v2 a close second (never liked the burrito tongue). I hated v3 because of the reverse burrito tongue and a stiff upper that pinched down on my foot. v4 was ok, but really ugly! When v5 came out and I saw all of the negative reviews, I decided to look around for a substitute. I like a shoe that is light weight (preferably under 9 oz), has a low heel-toe drop (4-6 mm), is flexible, is durable enough to last 350 miles, and looks good. Not a lot out there on the market, so I decided to give these a try despite the poor reviews. Maybe because of my low expectations coming into this, I was pleasantly surprised by these!Positives:- Very comfortable. To me, these are very similar to v1 in feel. I run in a lot of firm shoes for racing, and these are downright cushy.- Love the look and color schemes of the upper. I think each new version of these has gotten uglier until this one.- I hated the burrito tongues, and despite the negative reviews on the tongue on this version, I have had no issues. It is thin, but it stays in place and does the job.Negatives:- Too heavy. I will remind Brooks' designers that these were supposed to be a lightweight, ""natural"" shoe. All other versions came in under 9 oz (size 9), although the weight has edged up in each version. This version, at 9.7 oz, is a huge jump. On top of that, the Brooks website says that these are smaller than previous versions, so you should size up 1/2 size. This is a blatant move to disguise the fact that they are even heavier than 9.7 oz in a comparable size. I can definitely feel the weight (in my size 11.5, up from 11) and won't be purchasing the next version if these don't come back down.If you have run in previous versions, I would recommend trying these, despite the negative reviews out there. I did, and I am quite happy.",
110225,3,07/29/2016,"Decent Shoe I bought this pair back at the beginning of June.  I ran with the Purecadence 3 and 4, and I really liked those shoes.  Before I bought the 5s, I read through the reviews on here.  I've now logged about 130 miles on the 5s, and here are my comments. Also, I run about 20-35 miles per week:  -I agree that the soles seem to be more cheaply made than the 4s or even the 3s.  There's not as much cushioning, but I still feel like I get enough support from the shoe.-I experienced the same thing that others reported in terms of the tongue of the shoe scratching or poking their foot.  But I found that went away after I had broken them in a little bit.-Like others here, I also blistered on my heel after the first few runs.  However, I found that after about 30-40 miles, the shoes stopped rubbing on my heel.  So I think they just required so more breaking in.In summary, I agree that the 5s are not as good as the previous shoes, but they're not bad either.  I still like the low profile and the light weight, but I might switch to the Pureflow for my next shoe.",
110225,5,07/23/2016,Great shoe! This is my fifth pair of the Purecadence. I'm a big guy with a big foot and this shoe is perfect for me.,
110225,5,07/21/2016,FINALLY! I struggled for a ridiculously long time trying conquer what I call; The Battle of Feet vs Ankles. Stability shoes hurt my feet but leave my ankles feeling great - neutral shoes hurt my ankles but are wonderful for me feet. I stumbled upon The Run (Brooks' online community of avid runners) and spoke to some helpful contributors. They aimed me to these shoes and I'm so happy to say that they brought peace to my battle! They are the perfect balance.,
110225,4,07/11/2016,"Love 'em Had an old pair that I loved!  The new ones are super, but miss the tongue attachment on one side that my old pair had.",
110225,1,07/10/2016,"PureCadence 5 PureDisappointment I've been running in the PureCadence line since the first version. Versions 1 - 3 showed continuous improvements. Version 4 introduced the tongue which was a departure from the single piece wrap around. The change wasn't too bad as the iconic nav band remained. My guess it was done to save money or to make the shoe more appealing to a wider audience. Version 5 is the worst. The nav band has now been removed. The upper structure does not support your foot and it is very uncomfortable. Again, there is no innovation. I feel that the changes to the 5 were made to keep costs low and profits high and also try to appeal to a wider audience. I have purchased version 4 again but would rather buy version 3 if I could find it. I have purchased 7-8 PC shoes but will no longer do so. I still enjoy the PureGrit and other Brooks shoes but it is hard to be loyal to Brooks when my favorite shoe has been ruined. I have since moved on to Nike's Flyknit Lunar 3 to replace the runs were I would usually run in the PureCadence.",
110225,1,06/27/2016,"Just Horrible Im my opinion Brooks have got the Cadence 5 all wrong. I have hardly worn anything else over the past couple of years (cadence 3 and 4) no matter what distance (10k to Ultra) they have always proven versatile enough to stop me looking elsewhere. Then comes the cadence 5, firstly I know appearance isn't everything but the shoe just looks awful. Not wanting the look to put me off I tried it anyway and sadly this shoe feels and looks like something from the Brooks cushioned range (maybe the adrenaline series). The shoe doesn't give you the same feedback as the old cadence, it feels uncomfortably heavy and clunky with far too much cushioning. It's a confusing shoe that seems to have lost all the DNA of the previous cadence. Surely the whole point of the connect range is to appeal to the runner that likes a bit less cushion and more feed back? Maybe Brooks have realised they dropped the ball with this latest edition as they are still selling the cadence 4. I hope so, please Brooks return the cadence 6 to its former glory..!!",
110225,1,06/10/2016,Disappointed I've run in earlier versions of the Pure Cadence and liked them so much I ordered the PC 5 sight unseen. This pair of 8-1/2's were too long and flexing between my toes and mid-foot.  I returned from one long run with red marks and minor abrasion on the skin.  Thicker socks did no good.  I'm training for a marathon and could not see myself running 26.2 in these shoes.  I wanted to stay with the PC and returned to the store and ordered size 8.  I've always run in size 8-1/2's including earlier versions of the PC.  The 8's were too tight.  I ended up switching brands because the Brooks PC 5 were too uncomfortable.,
110225,4,06/10/2016,"Good shoes , need a few improvements. The colors are great. please get back to the blues! But always keep a black color also.",
110225,1,05/30/2016,"A poor upgrade to Precedence 4 Brooks took a great shoe and made it below average. Precedence 4 was a great shoe, the 5 feels like a very cheap stiff shoe almost like a standard tennis shoe. Just not worth the money",
110225,1,05/28/2016,"Soo Sad I loved my Pure Cadence 1 and Pure Cadence 2.  I don't run a whole lot, usually a 1-4 mile run once a week, so my last pairs of shoes lasted me quite a while.  I usually replace them when they start to hurt my feet from wearing out.  I pronate a bit, so when the ball of my foot behind my big toe starts getting sore, I know its time to switch.  These new Pure Cadence 5s pinch in exactly that spot.  Too bad, they were otherwise a nice pair of shoes.",
110225,1,05/19/2016,"Very Disappointed I have run in all 5 iterations of this shoe and the first four versions, particularly the 3rd and 4th, have been my favorites for running, having completed 5 marathons in them. Unfortunately, I think brooks lost its way with this one, this shoe is way too stiff on top and bottom and is quite uncomfortable. The uppers are way too stiff, particularly the area where the tongue is stitched into the vamp/toe of the shoe. there is no give for my (not overly) narrow feet, and the area puckers down when i tighten it, rubbing against the tip of my feet and causing blisters.  The soles are also too stiff, taking away the responsiveness of the shoe and making it lose some of that feel you get from the ideal heel.  Brooks has taken out much of the character that makes the pure series unique and turned the shoe into a generic, blocky, motion control shoe that at least has a low drop.  Hope they fix this with the next version.",
110225,1,05/18/2016,Was my favorite...not now The new updates have killed this shoe.   The toebox is very stiff. So much so that the top of my foot gets raw during long runs.  i have to wear bandaids on the top of foot now.  The shoe tongue is also too stiff and digs into my ankle.,
110225,5,04/25/2016,Second pair of cabence ,
110225,1,04/18/2016,PureCadence 5 Redesign Not Acceptable The Pure Cadence 5 has gone too plastic. Very uncomfortable tongue. Seems to have lost some of it's cushion or flexibility with the new sole. Very hot with the nearly all plastic side panels. Actually got blisters on both feet in my first 3 mile run out of the box. Never seen this before and I went through about 12 pairs of earlier versions of the Cadence Shoe. Didn't get any better after the first 3. Very disappointing.,
110225,1,04/17/2016,"Disappointing Upgrade from the PureCadence 3 From a runner's perspective, v5 is a major step down from the PureCadence 3.  Brooks took a unique shoe and dumbed it down to make it more generic.  The arch band is gone, the asymetric foot wrapping lacing is gone, the one piece toe box/tongue is gone, and the heel drop has increased.  What a disappointment, I thought I had found my shoe for the next several years.  This might be a decent shoe for some runners, but it is definitely NOT a continuation of the PureCadence 2 and 3 line.",
110225,1,04/17/2016,"These shoes should not be called PureCadence The changes to these shoes are so significant that they should no longer be called PureCadence. It might be acceptable if these changes were actually improvements. The shoes have worn raw multiple spots on the tops of my feet and cut the back of my ankle. There is also the annoyance of the shoes staining my socks blue from the inside of the shoe's tongue. The first pair I received had multiple defects: the tread on one shoe was not glued properly and could be peeled back easily, the structure in the ankle area was protruding – the cause of the cut on my ankle. The second pair I received are slightly better, but are still causing the same problems. The quality is quite dismal compared to previous PureCadences, with the stitching inside appearing haphazard. After 10 years with Brooks, I'll be looking elsewhere.",
110225,3,04/04/2016,"Brooks took a perfect shoe and made it average I am post-collegiate endurance runner with a neutral gait through I prefer to use shoes with a small amount of pronation control. I have used the Pure Cadence elusively for three years now. They fit my small, narrow, high arched feet perfectly. I never had problems with blisters or metatarsal stress reactions while using the Pure's like I had throughout competitive high school and collegiate training with other shoes. However, with the Pure Cadence 5, I have developed new blood blisters during each run greater than 6 miles. I am told that the shoe's last was changed in the recent update. The perfect fit that I spoke of earlier no longer applies and I must move on to another shoe. The shoe still has many strengths that will benefit runners with different feet, but I write this review to warn other fans of the shoe not to trust that it will continue to work it's magic for them.",
110225,3,04/03/2016,"Not for me... Liked the shoes for the most part, but the area from the tip of the shoes to where the laces start pinches the top of my foot. I also tried a size up to see if that was better and then I got blisters in areas I normally do not. This pinching issue was very uncomfortable and ultimately made the shoes a ""no go"" for me.",
110225,1,04/01/2016,"Bad Revamp Brooks really screwed up with their revamp of the PureCadence Gen 5.  I've been running in Pure Cadences since 2013 when I became a runner.  The PureCadences always had a nub around the midfoot outsole, which really helped in promoting midfoot striking and preventing pronation.  They did away with this in the gen 5s and instead the shoe looks more like one of their clunky motion control offerings.  I've taken this shoe out for approximately 50 miles and have started getting blisters on toes that have never had any issues in the Gen 1-4 PureCadences.  There is also no motion control support so I've started developing shin splints.  Bottom line: If you're a regular PureCadence runner, grab some Gen 4s and wait for Brooks to fix the design (Hopefully!) in the Gen 6s.  These shouldn't even be called PureCadences.",
110225,5,03/28/2016,"The 5 is better than the 4 and more like the 3! Everyday use. I have four pairs different colors. The 5 is the best yet. I always get any shoe which is mostly blue in the color. Currently have the lime green-- lots of comments on those. The black , blue and white is good. The 4's had the blue with yellow laces which I liked and the 3's had the white and yellow accents which was good. Would like to see those again.",
110225,5,03/23/2016,"Great shoe The tongue on the pure cadence 1, 2, and 3 was much better and the elastic band around the middle of the shoe will be missed on the pure cadence 5.",
110225,4,03/23/2016,"Had some toe irritation with the PureCadence 5 I feel that the toe-box on the Pure Cadence 5 is less roomy than previous versions. I initially developed a small cut on the top my next to smallest toe on my left foot after the first 3-4 miles. I switched to toe socks & still get a slight irritation on the same toe, otherwise I really like the feel & responsiveness of the 5's. I'm willing to take a chance with them when I run Boston in three weeks.",
110225,3,03/22/2016,"Mixed as I said above, the tongue is made of a material that tends to slide to the side almost immediately upon walking just a few steps....my previous pair of of Cadence  shoes had a different more fabric-like material that was much more comfortable.",
110225,3,03/20/2016,"Stable and Comfortable, But a Caveat I've loved the Pure Project Cadence series since Brooks started the line. There's alot to like about the shoe, including it's comfort and traction. Challenge for me is about 2 weeks in, I'm experienced foot stiffness and soreness following 4-5 mile runs, which is new for me with this series. Sole doesn't seem to have the curvature or earlier models. Again, big fan of the series, but may need to go back to the previous version.",
110225,2,03/15/2016,"Not Loving the Update The new seamless upper is great. Comfortable and provides a nice aesthetic. However, the shape just missed the point.Last...for the life of me I don't understand why they don't allow the laces a connection to the tongue. This has been a major problem with the last few versions of the shoe and could be EASILY fixed by adding a connection (something similar to on the Adrenaline).Unfortunately I will be without my go to race shoe this year. Fingers crossed for a better redesign (or maybe return) for the 6.",
110225,5,02/29/2016,"Going from Adrenaline to this and still the support is great I use these as my daily shoes for work, in the gym and for 5k runs two or three times a week. And these are easily one of the best shoes I have bought so far. I felt Adrenalines have too much support and because of the 12mm drop, I was heal striking a lot on them. But on these, my stride has naturally become better.They also have a springy feeling which I dig.Overall, great shoes. Extremely satisfied.",
110225,5,02/10/2016,Nice Upgrade to a Great Shoe I enjoyed running in the PureCadence 4 and had been waiting for the new version to come out.  It did not disappoint.  It feels even more comfortable and fits like a glove.  It really helps keep me landing on the middle of my foot instead of my heal.  I am flat footed and the PureCandence line has enough support to keep even the long runs pain free!,

110227,5,10/26/2017,"I love my Brooks ""Beast 16"" shoes! I like the quality and feel of my Brooks ""Beast 16"" running shoes. They fit perfectly, and I wear them every day! I have been wearing Brooks Beast shoes since 2011. I used to have problems with foot pain prior to purchasing my first pair. I had severe overpronation problems that caused severe pain in my foot when wearing other running shoes. Since I started wearing the Brooks Beast shoes, I have not had this problem.  My ""Beast 16"" running shoes provide awesome arch support, great comfort, and they look great on my feet.",
110227,5,10/26/2017,"Great Shoe for Heavier Runners I'm 50, and I've been a recreational runner for 35 years. I've tried a lot of shoes. A lot. Switching to Brooks 10 years ago was the best decision I made. The quality is always flawless, and the support (especially with the Beast) is excellent. For a runner on the heavier side (I'm 210 lbs.), this is the pair to have!",
110227,5,10/26/2017,"Clouds of Support Absolutely the best running shoes I've ever owned! Feels like running with pillows on my feet, I wear a 4E width and these were spot on GREAT SHOE.",

110227,4,10/21/2017,"Need a loyalty program I have purchased 3-4 pairs of Brooks Beast for the last 15 years.  Finally they have come out with great colors for those of us that can't wear other Brooks shoes.  My only suggestion is please come out with a loyalty program, buy 5 pairs get one half off, or something.  When I started buying them, they were $80, now they are double.  That is tough when you have to buy 3 or 4 pair a year.",
110227,5,10/19/2017,"Great Shoe I like this shoe alot! The only thing I would changed is the white stripe on the outside sole, so it wouldn't be so obvious that it a tennis shoe.",
110227,5,10/19/2017,Best shoes I've ever worn... I had back surgery a few years before I retired from the Marine Corps which pretty much ended my running.  I struggled for years to find a show that gave me the comfort that the Beast 16 does.  I am able to enjoy pain free walking now.  Thanks #ReviewSweeps,
110227,5,10/16/2017,Only pair of running shoes I'll own! Great shoes! I only run in the treadmill and these work great for that! Only improvement I'd like to see is more choices in colors! Otherwise they shouldn't change a thing!,
110227,3,10/15/2017,Noticed change....having trouble with shoe I have bought several pairs of beast shoes. All being amazing to wear. This pair I noticed a change having trouble keeping them on due to comfort.The beast 16 feels so different than past pair. It also looks and feels narrower in the toe.I have read many comments stating the same issue.With that said why ?Why change something that was not broke? Thank you for your time John,
110227,5,10/14/2017,#ReviewSweeps ,
110227,5,10/14/2017,I would buy again ,
110227,3,10/13/2017,Listen to sizing The size suggestion that they say it runs a half size small is true. For some reason my big toes are sore after every run. Could be because the half size up is too big. Doesn't fit like the earlier models. I have always wore a 10 and now I'm in a 10.5. With pronation I don't have a choice. I just hope the toe issues get solved.,
110227,5,10/12/2017,Excellent product I have had at least 20 pairs of this shoe and for me they are the best in the market,
110227,2,10/10/2017,Totally different feel The feel on these is radically different than the past 2 models.  I wore these for the support and because I have flat feet.  Very disappointed.,
110227,3,10/09/2017,Nice shoe but insoles fell apart I've been wearing Beast's for years and the '16 version has held up well except for the insoles. They both came apart in each shoe 1-2 months after buying them.,
110227,4,10/09/2017,"A podiatrist's review of his 20th pair of the Beast Probably the best motion control shoe on the market.  A serious flaw:  The heel wears very quickly.  I am lucky to get 200 miles, so during marathon season they do not last long.  If you are a forefoot runner, you will get much more, but in that case you likely do not need to be in this shoe.  Brooks, please work on the outsole.",
110227,5,10/08/2017,"Yes!!!! I would buy again I've stayed away from Brooks shoe, can't really say why, I stuck with nike thats all I ran in. I increase my mileage because of training for marathons. This year 2017 I have had lot of injuries mostly having to do with my feet, I couldn't find a nike shoe that would work for me. I finally look in to brooks and looked up what shoe would work for me, one of them ended being the brooks beast 16 after looking at the specs, I bought the beast. I don't know why I didn't sooner, I received them on a Friday and I ran a Half Marathon on the next day Saturday, most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, I got size 15 2e they fit great, I'm a heavier flat footed runner.  I'm extremely satisfied with the shoe, as of now I will NEVER run a race in a nike shoe, only brooks for me.",
110227,4,10/07/2017,"Not as comfortable as the Beast 14 (tight) I have tremendously fallen arches. Found that the Beast 14 were very comfortable. I have 3 pairs. The only shoe I can wear. Being the ""14"" wasn't available anymore, bought the ""16"". Not as happy as with the ""14"", but wearable.",
110227,5,10/06/2017,"A shoe wirth buying again These shoes were bought for work. Bad knees, bad back and bunions.  They give the support needed.",
110227,5,10/02/2017,"Blown away by the support for bunions and flat feet. I workout constantly, not endurance running however this shoe helps on leg days and for the 9-5 job I work. I have had bunions since I can remember and my feet are almost flat, so finding a shoe with correcting gait biomechanics feels impossible. Even new balance came close but nothing like this shoe, I finally felt what it feels like to have an arch!!!!!           I would recommend this shoe to anyone that needs stability in their feet/ankles/knees. As for wear and tear I bought them yesterday so I'm not quite sure about how long they last but they are by far the most comfortable shoe I've ever put on. Normally my feet hurt every day but they did not yesterday, and I hit my legs and worked a 9-5!!!!",
110227,4,10/01/2017,Best shoe I have ever owned I was refered to the beast by some helpful workers at a local shoe store to help with my foot pain. The beast offers wonderful arch support for my flat feet and helps with my pronation better than most other shoes I've tried. Works great for when I need to spend hours on my feet at work or just going for a walm.,
110227,5,09/22/2017,"A timeless shoe for sure. Provides unmatched support for someone with flat feet or any type of foot issues, yet is comfortable, flexible and not overly heavy.  The shoes breathes quite well.",

110227,2,09/14/2017,Am returning for half size shorter. ,
110227,2,09/11/2017,Very disappointed that this shoe doesn't come narrower I wore a 12 D in the Brooks Beast 14.  The recommendation for the Beast 16 was to order a half size larger so I ordered a size 12.5 D.  The length is fine but they are too wide and don't provide enough support on the sides.  My feet seem to float around in them and they do not come in a narrower width.  Very disappointed.  Won't be buying any more of the Brooks Beast 16.,
110227,1,09/10/2017,"Horrid Most expensive pair of sneakers I have ever owned and purchased them to help with a poor instep. Within 2 months, the stitching started to come apart and now I have a hole in the toes on both feet. My $50 pair of n-balance are still going strong after 2 years!",
110227,5,09/04/2017,Great comfort ,
110227,1,08/30/2017,LOST LOVE FOR BROOKS I have been buying Brooks Beast for the last few years and have loved the shoe. This year I ordered a pair from my local shoe store as always and starting having foot problems. I could not figure out what was wrong until I went to Brooks site. Seems someone wearing the desk over there has changed the shoe mold. The disclaimer says the shoe runs a half size smaller. Why would you do this and not call it a 15 1/2? Now do you think they make a 16 1/2 nope or a 17 nope they just cut that market segment out so now I go to buy the adrenaline similar shoe all sold out of 16 wide. I am going back to a competitor this was a very low blow to a person that enjoyed and really promoted your shoes.,
110227,5,08/16/2017,Love this shoe buy it every year!!! I love the beast my brother Dad feel the same. Need to offer discounts for seniors. 😀,
110227,5,08/07/2017,I would buy again  price ,
110227,5,08/07/2017,"Still love the shoe When the  latest model of the Beast came out I listened to some bad reviews and after many years  of wearing the shoe went back to a NB shoe. The NB shoe did not work for me and created a new issue. I purchase my running shoes a half to full size big and due to a bad arch wear orthotics. I need full motion control shoes to run and the Beast has helped me for years. The new shoe fits a tad more snug  then before while providing good motion control, comfort and a kind of cushy ride, size runs perfectly for me. I have about 75 miles on them so I cannot comment on wear yet. I change shoes about  every three months (250-275) so wear is kind of relative. In terms of motion control, I think this  is about the best  shoe  out  there.",
110227,5,08/06/2017,I would buy again Love the shoe. Only shoe that works for as far as comfort for working out and working .I'm on my feet a lot .I just wish you guys didn't go up on the price so often the shoes going to be $200 one day I think that's a little ridiculous. I used to pay $89 for those shoes of long time ago but I think 160-plus is just so unfair I think you need a repeat customer discount.,
110227,4,08/04/2017,"I would buy this product again. Compared to the Beast 14, the shoe feels wider mostly due to a re-design of how the tongue is attached (only at the toe).  With this design change, the tongue now ""bunches up"" a little in the center after lacing.",
110227,5,08/03/2017,"Perfect for wide feet I am a mailman with a walking route. I had a stress fracture from years on my feet last year and after a cast for six weeks my Podiatrist suggested Brooks shoes . At first I got Glycerins ,they are great and well-cushioned . But Glycerins only come in medium width and even though I would get a half-size bigger to negate the narrowness it still felt tight. Once I ordered the Beast my foot felt better and unrestricted. Cushioning is great and my feet feel great. For wide feet ,it's The Beast.",
110227,1,08/02/2017,"Very Dissappointing As a 10 year plus Beast wearer the 16's are a colossal disappointment. These actually HURT my feet--a rare occurrence with any running shoe. They are narrower than previous Beasts (""sleeker"" in Brooks parlance) and the toe box seems stunted. Note to Brooks: Your ""base"" for this shoe is us flat-footed pronators (and some heavier runners too). By tweaking the last you may attract a few neutral gait runners, but you're losing your original target flock.  Sadly, I'm now forced to consider other brands.",
110227,5,07/27/2017,Brooks is the best ,
110227,2,07/24/2017,Beast 16 I had 2 pair of the beast 14s awsome shoes best i have ever had. So i pcked up the beast 16s not the worst shoe i have had but didn't hold a candle to the Beast 14s. The 16s  were a huge disappointment... if your looking for a new shoe look else were. I hope they go back to the support and comfort of the 14s. If not i will be on the hunt again for another shoe....,
110227,4,07/24/2017,"Thi is my 4th pair of Brooks Beast. I noticed another "" Beast"" shoe in your shoe lineup. Are these just older model Beast shoes?",
110227,5,07/21/2017,Love this shoe. I'm 6'2 250lbs and wear orthotics. I went through 7 pairs of shoes before finding this gem. Great fit and support. Quality shoe all around. And so comfortable.,
110227,5,07/19/2017,Brooks Beast 16 I buy this shoe for a friend.  He has a bad foot and this shoe seems to fit best and keep him from rolling his foot.  He has been wearing Brooks Beast for years!,
110227,1,07/09/2017,"The fit is dramatically different from prior models! I have owned at least 20 pairs of Beast and I eagerly purchased the 16.  The fit seems VERY different, and while the length is true-to-size, the arch of my my foot swims in the shoe laterally giving me a ton of foot pain.  This is heartbreaking given that this shoe was THE SOLUTION for me for so many years in terms of the combination of stability and cushion.   VERY bummed that I have to wait until 2018 to HOPEFULLY get a fix.",
110227,5,06/29/2017,"First time Brooks buyer- not the last time though I am a RN who is trying (rather desperately) to get in better shape. I have never spent as much on athletic shoes before. The Beast is exceptional, as someone who is on my feet literally the majority of my 12 hour shift, the Beast remains comfortable and padding is more than adequate (read: impact related back and knee aches reduced). Exercise-wise the shoes are stable and comfortable in any role. The only possible Neg I can think of is the seam (or pressure point) that runs along the outside of the ball of my foot (my feet are very wide 6E in most shoes < ie new balance>, but a 4E will suffice in most cases) and I wear compression socks (thin). the sizing application is accurate, but the shoe does run small comparatively.",
110227,5,06/27/2017,"2nd pair of beasts, I love them. I needed a supportive, wide shoe to help overcome prolonged foot problems, including 2 surgeries.  The beast 4e was the perfect solution..",
110227,4,06/26/2017,"Great shoe! I changed from the Ghost to the Beast, I went up half a size 12.5 ghost to 13 Beast.  Overall very happy, the first couple runs I had to stop to tighten up the laces several times.  Not that they were getting loose, but just that I needed to really crank them tight to prevent a pinch point over my big toe.  After about 20-30 miles on them, it just seems normal now, I just have to make sure to lace them tight to start.  Other than the above, I love the feel, way more shoe, but very supportive and I feel like I could run all day in them.",
110227,5,06/17/2017,Fantastic Beasts!! I work on concrete and a brutal schedule. These are by far the most supportive and comfortable shoes I have worn.,
110227,5,06/15/2017,The Beast is the shoe for me. My doctor wanted me to use a motion control shoe and this was the best I could find. I wear them virtually all the time.,
110227,5,06/02/2017,Second Pair - Great Support My second pair of Brooks Breast Shoes.  The first ones are now used for golf and the second pair is for walking and running.  These are very supportive shoes with a padded arch and sole that make a difference in your gait and step if you require substantial support.  I wish these were available in the GTX waterproof version because these are not good in the rain and I walk/run rain or shine.   The best pair of support shoes I own - Brooks Beast.,
110227,5,05/30/2017,I been wearing the Beast for 10 years and will continue to. I walk 6 miles every day and I wouldn't walk in any other shoe....the Beast works (I have pronation problems) and is very comfortable and it's a plus that the fit is so similar to my previous pair that my new ones take no break in period.,
110227,5,05/17/2017,like how the she feels like how it fits and keeps my feet dry--will wear it for a while to see if I may need to but a 2ed set or not half a size bigger but that was my fault because I only got a half a size up when it said it may fit tight,
110227,2,05/16/2017,Beast 16 The Beast 14 was the best shoe I found for my Plantar Fasciitis. The new 16 bothers it for some reason.,
110227,2,05/15/2017,"Less durable, cheap sole The latest edition of Brooks' Beast is markedly less durable than previous editions.  These shoes have been, for years, my go-to because they are incredibly stable - I typically get 500 miles of use before the soles wear thin.  But not the Beast 16 - I am barely 300 miles into the current pair, and the soles at the outer heels are already worn through.  Incredibly disappointing!  I have been dedicated to Brooks for years - a frequent route takes me past Brooks' headquarters here in Seattle - but this shift to weaker materials is going to force me to a different shoe manufacturer.",
110227,2,05/14/2017,The current Beast '16 disappoints The 2014 and 2015 Beast were far better than this current model. I may switch from Brooks.,
110227,4,05/09/2017,Nice sneaker- 14 better ,
110227,3,05/09/2017,"No I would not. The Brooks 14 was a better fit for me, the Brooks 16 is made a little shorter length wise.  So they don't fit me now.",
110227,5,05/06/2017,"Good shoe overall I am a bigger guy starting to get back in shape, the Beast was recommended from a number of sources, glad I tried it. Very well cushioned for shock absorption important for me for exercise and in my job as a RN",
110227,2,05/05/2017,"It wasn't broke, but they tried to fix it I recently purchased my 3rd or 4th pair of Brooks Beast shoes over the last several years and, unfortunately, I have to say I'm disappointed by the changes made to the Beast by Brooks Running. I eagerly laced these up and went running the morning after receiving them... and came back with blisters due to the smaller sizing and narrower toebox. I can't understand why Brooks would change such a fantastic product, the only sneaker for which I would happily shell out the asking price.",
110227,4,05/03/2017,The Beast 16 is not the same as the previous years model This is the forth year I've ordered the Beast. I walk 3.5 miles a day and generally they last about 12 months. I find the 2016 model not as good and comfortable as previous years models.,
110227,4,05/02/2017,"I am about to buy this product again. It is a great shoes for me. However the heel wears off too quickly for my use.  That makes it a very expensive running shoes.  Just six weeks, and the heel is starting to wear off!",
110227,1,04/29/2017,"no Ugly, use to buy  a Beast 10 wide bought for 10 years, sent this pair back, find something good always have to change  it. I think you will get a lot of these coming back waiting for refund in my checking account.",
110227,4,04/28/2017,"Great shoe line but the new tongue wanders off to the side. My biggest problem is that the tongue isn't secured on the sides like the 14 Beasts, causing it to drift off to the side after a few minutes of wear. Very frustrating.",

I like this Beast much more than the previous model, but this new Beast doesn't have as good of motion control as previous Beasts and is much more narrow.  Too deal with this, I purchased the 4E extra wide version, and it fits like the old regular Beasts.  I put in my custom orthotics to help with pronation and the shoes are awesome.  I am going to purchase a second pair since I've had a hard time finding a running shoe that works so well for me.",

They never seem to fully wear out, but I love the feeling of a new pair of shoes.  And Brooks seems to make them better with each update.  I plan to stick with the Brooks Beast shoes as long as they continue to have the high quality and comfort I've come to expect.",

After 4 days of wearing the shoes, I'm having massive lower back pain. The height of the heel from the ground seems taller than in beast 2014 yet, the shoe feels way less cushioned. IDK if its the lack of the gel  in the heel or what.  Went back to my old shoes last 2 days and back starting to hurt less. Never had this problem going from '10 to '12 and 12' to '14.

110227,1,03/26/2017,Used to LOVE these shoes...things have changed! I have purchased many pairs of Brooks Beasts over the years...the last pair I had were sent back for defects after a few weeks and the replacement pair wore out too quickly. I love these shoes so much I recently bought a new pair (even knowing the longevity issues) Beast 16. The web site warned to get a half size bigger but there were no half sizes above 13. The shoes arrived and after one week I decided to send them back...they are too narrow...I ordered 2E as I had for years but these are too tight. I'm guessing they brought on another mfr or moved mfg to another county as these shoes have dropped in quality over the last two years.,

110227,4,03/22/2017,"As Expected - The Best Shoe on the market I have used this brand for over 14 years - From when I was over 400+ lbs down to my current weight.  They not only have served me well but they are the one consistent piece of equipment that I can count on day in and day out. I typically keep 2 pair around and alternate them.  The work for me on the treadmill for my 2 hour runs on Wednesdays, on the road, doing circuit training, on the trail, climbing up Camelback when I visit Arizona and my Spin classes when I don't want to use my Clip Ins.  I wear a 16 2E and these provide great cushioning and support. Especially when I happen to misstep on curbs etc.  They are like top of the line tires on a car.  Irreplaceable.

The 11 1/2 was recommended by the Brooks staff, and was too big.  Had to return for a size 11.  Glad to now have the size 11 shoes, but the '16 Beast is not the '14.  Not thrilled with the fit, and they feel very stiff, and surprisingly less supportive.  Knees, shins are sore.  Will give them another week or two.",
110227,3,03/13/2017,"First time concern with product I have been using the Beast for a while now (purchased several pair over the years)with great experiences.  I relied on the fit and usability.  Prior to ordering the current pair I read a recommendation to buy a 1/2 larger size because the shoes ran small.  The length seems to fit ok, but the width is terrible.  the top bunches up near the toe causing the shoe to pinch my feet.  I am really contemplating whether I should buy this model/brand in the future.",
110227,2,03/11/2017,"quality deterioting I have worn Brooks Beast since the early 90's and never had any complaints and would always recommend them. However, I noticed a change in the quality in the 14's and now see that the quality has deteriorated even more in the 16's. They look and feel like a much less expensive shoe. I will keep these and continue to wear them, but they will probably the last pair of Brooks shoes I buy.",
110227,2,03/09/2017,"Toe box too small The sole doesn't have the angle to compensate for flat feet/bowed legs like the 14's did and it runs slightly narrower. The styling is nice but there need to be more color options for this model. My biggest grievance is that the toe box comes to a point much too quickly and forces my big toe inward. If you want bunions, this is your show, if not, but something else, or a size/ size and a half bigger.",

I was excited to see the new Brooks 16's when they came out with a new design.  I purchase 4 pair a year since that is the only shoe I wear.  I am VERY flat footed but run alot and am very active.  The shoes have always been great.  That's why I was so surprised when I purchased the 16's and they never seemed to break in like the all my other pairs.  They are very uncomfortable and the back heal slips alot on my left foot.  I was always able to open up a new box and run some miles in them with no discomfort whatsoever but not with these.  I am very leery of purchasing another pair because of my experience.  If I do decide to purchase a pair I am HOPING my present pair was a fluke.  I don't want to have to start looking and experimenting with other shoes with motion control.,
110227,3,01/18/2017,"only shoe my son can wear but doesn't last long My son has very flat feet and this is the only shoe he can wear. He has three pairs right now, in various stages of repair. The first thing to go is always that reinforcement on the toe which starts to come lose. Then the sole starts to go. Then we need new ones. He goes though about three pairs a year. At this price, that's unfortunate. I own many shoes such as Ecco which I've had sometimes for decades. Not this shoe. Its glued together and the sole wears out and its done.",
110227,5,12/14/2016,"good shoe, need more colors for such a good shoe work about 8 to 9 hrs a day, dr recomemeded them with the orthopedic inserts i got. i have extreme pronation and these actually help with control. the paid i use to get in my foot is slowly going away.i really like the shoes and am getting use to the inserts. this is the second pair of beasts i have owned and both pair are super! its a very good quality shoe and cheaper than nike, which messed up my foot in the first place. its worth the investment if you concerned about your feet and being comfortable! i will continue to buy this type until they dont sell them anymore! just wish they had more colors or maybe even a shoe custom app where you can make your own shoe!",
110227,3,12/05/2016,Toe Mesh = Bad Design I have had several pairs of Beasts over the years and the toe design changed for the worse.  The mesh area increased and now my big toe pops out of the mesh on one shoe after a short while. I called Brooks about it and the advice was to put duct tape inside the toe area under the mesh.  Better idea would be to go back to more solid material in the toe area!,
110227,1,11/26/2016,Very disappointed I have purchased Brooks Beast for many years.The '16 is made with much less quality.Poor fit and comfort.,

I finally made the switch and got used to the styling, but the latest change has left me wondering what I'm going to do, I really don't like the change. I'd appreciate a less flashy styling.",

110227,5,10/11/2016,Love the shoes!!! Love these shoes . I have had trouble with plantar fasciitis and heel Spurs . My foot doctor recommended that I try them. Have been wearing them ever since. Would recommend to anyone that has work on concrete. Your not nearly as fatigued or have hurting feet after a long day. I would recommend the company to make Brooks high top shoes and slip resistant shoes.,
110227,3,10/11/2016,"Shoe size is smaller (i.e., shorter) than previous Beasts The 2016 Beast is definitely shorter than the other 6 or 8 pairs of the Beast I have owned.  I have had a problem with every pair of the Beast I have owned in that the toe stitching comes undone with wear in the big toe area.  I use the Beast for walking and working out at the gym and they do not get abusive use, yet on every pair the stitching on top of the big toe area starts to wear immediately and eventually the stitching comes undone.  I wish Brooks would address this design flaw in the Beast.",

110227,1,10/05/2016,"Design Issues There is a design change from the Beast 14. The fabric on the lower part of the tongue bunches up when the lower laces are tightened. This bunched fabric pushes on the top part of the foot and irritates that area of the foot. I order the same size as my Beast 14 - 2E width and my foot slipped out of the shoe. I returned and ordered a D width and the same problem with the tongue occurs. Also, the toe area does not have the room that the Beast 14 had. The height is lower so your toes rub on the top mesh part of the shoe. The front of the shoe is not as rounded so less room for toes.",
110227,4,10/04/2016,"same good quality so far, but change in fit as I mentioned, the shoe makes my heels hurt. It is not just this shoe. I bought it because I thought it would be different from the last beast 14 I bought that did the same thing... All beast shoes I have bought previous to these last two, I have had no problems at all. I have been wearing them for probably 15 years. So did you change something? I will continue to wear them anyway because it is the only shoes I can wear. I would hightly recommend a rewards program for faithful people like me who have spent 1000's of dollars on shoes from brooks. Keep track of us! no pun intended.",
110227,5,09/28/2016,Still a great shoe Corrected the way I walk. Was told four years ago I needed knee replacement. Started wearing this shoe and a joint supplement and was pain free in a short time and still am if I change shoes every three months.,

110227,3,09/27/2016,Thought they would be better I got these shoes to help my feet and knees which take a pounding at work.  I'm disappointed the cushioning isn't better. Also the heel impact cushioning needs to be better especially at this price.,
110227,5,09/24/2016,Great shoe for me since 1978 ,
110227,5,09/24/2016,Beast '16 I am 6' 5'' 230lbs male with a major injury to my right ankle. I have been wearing the Beast for years now. It is the only shoe that consistantly provides a comfortable and stable foundation for walking.,
110227,1,09/16/2016,If you liked the 14's this shoe isn't for you I've worn these for years actually got me out of an Arizona boot.  Now I order the 16's thinking they would be awesome...I haven't had a new style of shoe in a decade and low and behold they ruined a great shoe.  I have an ankle that needs to be fused eventually but the beast kept me going now I'm afraid they have taken away the one shoe that worked for me.  I've heard others not thrilled with the changes I hope Brooks listens to those of us that need the extra support and cushion.,
110227,4,09/09/2016,"Good Shoe I have 3 pairs of the Beast 14's and love that shoe, so I was excited when the 16's came out. It is a good shoe, however, they are not as cushioned as the 14's. They seem to be a bit stiffer. Other than that this is a good shoe.",
110227,4,09/01/2016,Best shoe I have ever bought. I use this shoe for everyday wear.  It has such a great support feel although it makes me feel a bit taller.  Was unhappy when I found out Flemings  charged me $20 more than the retail price.,

Unfortunately Nike doesn't make motion control and stability shoes any more.So I started agressively searching for next batch of motion control and stability shoe I would purchase.I've recently tried: New Balance 990 v4, Brooks Beast 14 & 16, Asic Keyano's 23, Saucony Hurricane 2...So far Beast 14 seems to be best for following reasons:StabilityComfortCushioningMotion ControlRoom in Toe BoxHeel Counter is HighExtremely Comfortable & Snug fitI had to get 1/2 size larger...I highly recommend the Brooks Beast 14.The Beast 16 seems to be shorter in length, lil cramp in toe box, heel counter is lower and heel area not as snug or deep as Beast 14.I had to try full size larger in Beast 16 and it still wasn't as comfortable as Beast 14...  Width ok, toes push against top of shoe which feels bit short even it's full size longer ( 13 instead of 12 ).12.5 D Beast 14 are great13.0 D Beast 16 feel too smallI'll give updated report after actually trying them outside.I'd highly recommend Beast 16 if they feel comfortable to the user...I want the Beast 16s to workout as I'd rather have latest of greatest technology on my feet...Hopefully after wearing them for awhile they'll be ok...If only I can get heel to feel more snug.  Counter is shorter than Beast 14. Maybe smugness in heel can be achieved with different shoe lacing patterns.  I'll give that'll try later...Wish shoe manufactures could upgrade shoes but maintain fit and comfort while enhancing shoe.",
110229,4,11/21/2017,"Will cover any distance I have run all 25 of my marathons in Brooks shoes--most of which in the ST5's.  So, I was obviously initially disappointed when Brooks elected to discontinue the ST5's and switch to Asteria. However, the Asteria's have NOT disappointed at all!  In fact, a step up in terms of the overall 'feel' of the shoe.  Snug on your foot, lightweight, flexible, but still enough protection and padding to cover the marathon distance.  Furthermore, I occasionally had troubles keeping the shoe laces tied on the ST5's--especially as they wore 200+ miles. Yet, with the Asteria's, it's never been an issue. This shoe will cover any distance, as I typically switch between three pairs for speed-work, mid-week workouts and then long Saturday runs.  Run anywhere from 30-45 miles a week.  Log approximately 250-275 miles on each pair.",
110229,5,10/08/2017,"Lightweight + a touch of support = exceptional Yet another example of Brooks catching up with leading alternatives for racing flats with a touch more in the shoe. They are light and surprisingly responsive, and they don't break down quickly. If more marathons are in my future, they will definitely be in this shoe. The same is true for most other road races that I run and definitely for workouts on the road.",

I would qualify this shoe as almost neutral, the support that  provides is not existent and forget to use them for long distances. Since Brooks decided to discontinue the Racer ST I've looking in stores if they have any Racer ST left, I would have to change brands after using Brooks for almost 5 years because their new models don't offer a truly moderate overpronation support.Yes it is a very lightweight shoe but does not provide the support that someone with over pronation needs.",

I have been looking for a lighter, but sturdy and quick shoe that doesn't leave me feeling banged up after hard efforts. The Asteria felt wonderful during both my break in run and my  10 mile race this past weekend. I'm looking forward to my upcoming Half Marathon to really let these shoes shine!",

The GT-5 racers were my favorite shoe, and the Asteria has aptly replaced them. Amazing comfort right out of the box. Very light, yet feel decent cushion and support. Have raced a ten-miler in them and they performed very well on gravel surface. Planning on running a Marathon in them.  Only have 38 miles on them, so can't comment on durability, but i'm guessing 250 miles.  Only cons: hate the ""Night brite"" color!",
110229,5,08/30/2016,"Without a doubt the best running shoe I've ever owned. I was a little worried when Brooks replaced my beloved Racers with the Asteria, I've got a wide foot and I'm not a fan of pink so I went with the men's version of the shoe. They fit just as well as the unisex Racers and I like the two-toned black and florescent yellow coloring even better. I pair them with custom insoles and wear one pair for when I run on the paved street or on the treadmill and another pair in my active day-job as a food photographer. They are by far the best running shoes I have ever owned.",
110229,5,08/24/2016,Awesome lightweight trainer or racer One of the best lightweight running shoes on the market!  Stable and lightweight with just the right amount of heel to toe drop.  Not too soft or too stiff.....just right.  I added  inserts to increase the stability and I use these  shoes for virtually ALL of my long runs now.  Only con is they don't grab smooth/wet pavement very well.....but few shoes do. I would recommend this shoe to ALL but the heaviest runners.,
110231,5,12/26/2017,I have worn only Brooks for years and will continue to buy. I walk for 45 minutes per day and do exercise class three times a week and am thankful that Brooks shoes are so comfortable.,

The shoe, along with a special orthopedic insole And physical therapy took care of the inflammation. I found that if I kept wearing the dyad series the planter fasciitis did not recur. I am disappointed that in the past two- three years, The toebox seems to be getting more narrow and more importantly the insole cushioning is decreasing.  I would still recommend this to a friend but with reservations.",

My used Dyad 8's feel more cushioned than these. If I were to relate it to another shoe, they feel about as cushioned as an Asics 2000GT, which are about $50 less.

To my surprise it only took a few times wearing them to break them in but afterwards on my runs I really enjoyed  to exercise while wearing my brooks. I had made the switch from the glycerin 13 to NB FOAM and figured out I wasn't happy with my performance which lead me back to a different model in the dyad.

But this new version has significant changes. Under the guise of a ""new streamlined silhouette"" they made the toe box substantially more narrow. Toes are squeezed together resulting in terrible foot pain and fatigue. Tried a second pair just to make sure: same mess. Ordered the wide (2E) version. Of course that was TOO wide.

110231,3,06/08/2017,"Comfortable but lacking I was fitted for these from the Saucony Ride series after they changed the toe box. They said it would offer more support for my foot then what the Ride was offering( also have wide feet). Shoes are very comfortable and I think would be best suited for a gym and light walking shoe. The blown rubber sole has worn very quickly to the point where some of the tread is already worn flat. Kind of a let down considering I got these shoes in the end of April. I cover about 35 miles a week between walking with my wife and running. Ive never had a shoe wear this fast. Where I honestly think this shoe would shine is in the gym. So I would NOT recommend this shoe to someone who likes getting mileage in.  Now if you are hitting the gym classes, this shoe would be awesome for you in my opinion. I gave this shoe 3 stars because it has the potential to be an awesome shoe, just need a tougher compound on the sole. I will most likely not buy another pair for myself.",

I have been having bad ball-of-the-foot/metatarsal numbness and pain because of some overly supportive, everyday New Balance walking shoes that I was wearing that keep my low back happy - but not my poor feet.  I wear 11.5 4E wide shoes, have a wide forefoot, narrow heel, and medium to low arches.  This Dyad shoe is very comfortable!  I have noticed that my feet are not so sore, achy, partially numb and painful at the end of the day when wearing these wonderful shoes.  The heel strike does not bother my low back and the cushioning is good for the forefoot in the roomy toe box - finally the right shoes for everyday use!  Very, very happy with these shoes.  I still wear my Brooks Beast 14 with a sof sole insert for exercise and fitness walking, but I wear these wonderful Dyad shoes daily for regular walking.  Very comfortable. Don't stop making them!",

110231,5,03/14/2017,"Last sneaker I'm buying I have custom-made orthotics that fix length discrepancies and supination, and have never had a shoe that is both good for running and capable of fitting the orthotics well. This is the first shoe to let me do both. It is also durable enough to withstand heavy gym workouts.",
110231,4,03/13/2017,Great Running Shoe Great running shoe. I did need to order the EE. Seem to run a little narrow compared to my Dyad 8. Very comfortable and light weight.,
110231,1,03/01/2017,"Huge disappointment As a dyad user for many years, the changes made to the dyad 9 come as a huge disappointment. Not near so soft on the bottom of the feet and the arch support is too high for my flat feet. They basically made the insert thinner and so the shoe now feels hard to my feet and the arch plain hurts!  I tried all the other Brooks models and unfortunately will have to find a different shoe company. Not sure why they changed what was working ( not on this site but I have seen similar complaints on other sites).......",
110231,5,12/13/2016,Deep for Orthotics If you wear orthotics these are the shoe for you.  I have a very large wedge correction under my heel and big toe and these are the only shoes that fit properly with them.  Buy neutral and let the orthotic do the work.The only negative about this shoe is Brooks refuses to make them attractive.  This is year end and year out the ugliest shoe Brooks makes.,
110231,5,10/13/2016,want to wear to bed:) ,
110231,5,10/05/2016,"Outstanding New Shoe!! I love this new updated Dyad! I have worn many pair of the Dyad 8 over the last few years and am thrilled with the new Dyad 9. They've made the sole even wider, which is helpful for those of us who are prone to turning ankles. When I have the opportunity to take my shoes off I often forget to! I find these even more comfortable than Dyad 8, which was already a great shoe. Will be ordering more pairs soon! :)",
110231,5,09/29/2016,"Great improvement from the Dyad 8 ! An avid Brooks Dyad runner since the Dyad 5, the Dyad 9 is a vast improvement over it's predecessors! Brooks made it a bit lighter and improved the forefoot flexibility. I wear orthotics for running and racing and would like to see Brooks lighten the weight a bit more and lower the heel to toe offset to around 7 or 8mm for a more efficient run. For those with an overall neutral gait or slight pronation issues that wear orthotics and want to continue to RUN HAPPY, the Dyad 9 rules!",
110234,3,11/06/2017,Try before buy. ,
110234,4,10/25/2017,"Very light, minimal shoe This is a great racing flat. It just feels fast. My one comfort issue is the back part was chafing my Achilles tendon. That could also be an issue with my sock or my foot specifically though. Otherwise, I have really enjoyed this shoe, though it is not the type to do a lot of miles in. Great for speed work.",
110234,5,10/23/2017,"Highest Recommendation! My marathon PR was 3:35.19, and had held for two years; then I got the Hyperions!  I train daily with Glycerine 15s so I wanted a race-day shoe with a similar drop.  I wore these on two break-in runs (8 & 13 miles respectively) prior to racing in them.  Not only did I beat my PR, I CRUSHED IT!  I finished in 3:24.27; almost 11 minutes ahead of my long-standing PR!!  My turnover rate was up 8 strides per minute compared to previous races and the shoes felt great on my feet.  I was concerned that they would feel too firm compared to my Glycerines.  While they are more firm, I barely noticed.  The ride was smooth and the cushioning was totally sufficient, even at mile 26.  These aren't everyday shoes, and I expect they won't last much past 200 miles.  That said, with 50 miles in, the tread still looks like new.  If you're looking for a PR and want a comfortable, fast, ultra-light shoe, you definitely won't regret lacing up the Hyperion!!",
110234,5,10/02/2017,"These shoes work very well for me These shoes are definitely better for short, explosive workouts rather than long runs. They are light, so it makes my feet feel like they are nothing compared to my other shoes. I'm a fan for sure.",
110234,5,09/15/2017,Excellent running shoe for both novice and advanced runner Excellent cushion for a light weight shoe that allows for extended running where competitors fall short,
110234,3,09/14/2017,"I would not buy this product again Very light weight but narrow fit. Does not provide lateral stability like a Glycerin for example.  Shoe liner will move slightly until you've worn them a few times, then it will mold to the bottom of the shoe. The tongue of the shoe, if not adjusted properly exposes stitching on top of shoe that will scratch the top of you feet.",
110234,5,08/30/2017,Super light Very durable for such a light shoe. Excellent construction. Not goot for even slight pronation. Brooks quality at its best.,
110234,5,07/20/2017,Lightweight and sleek My first pair of running flats and I love them! I improved my first 5K using these new shoes by 1 1/2 minutes from my last 5K that was only a week prior. They are so lightweight yet still have a solid feel...and they look awesome!,
110234,5,07/19/2017,"Light, fast, and comfortable. ",
110234,5,07/04/2017,What an awesome shoe! Always loved Brooks shoes! Have ran in the pure connect for a few years now and have been trying to find something new. Hard to look for another shoe given the wide variety these days. Thanks to therunningclinic.com I was able to find something comparable in the Hyperion. I usually run in a minimalist index of 60%-70% (see website mentioned for details). The Hyperion is super close to that and is incredibly light! Looking forward to more great shoes from Brooks!,
110234,5,06/27/2017,"Great Racing and Uptempo Training Shoe The cushioning was very impressive, considering how light the shoe is. Of all the lighter performance shoes I've used, Hyperion had the best cushion/responsive ratio. Exceedingly better than any of the Pureflows I had.The energy return was the game changer. I consistently get very good stride turnover in the shoes with little effort. I have consistently ran any pace more efficiently and with a lower heart rate than I would at the same pace in my other training/racing shoes.My only negative is that heel strikers may not like it for daily training, bc it was hard to land on the midsole at a slow pace. It's definitely built for faster running.",
110234,5,06/26/2017,"Marathon PR with My New Brooks Hyperions I was a little uncertain about the lack of cushioning for a race as a long as a marathon, but these shoes proved to be up for the match with no question. They are so light it really feels like you have socks on, socks that are rocket powered. I shaved 4 minutes off of my marathon PR and I think these shoes definitely added to my overall success.",
110234,5,06/21/2017,Great Shoes! I have been running in Ghosts for awhile and wanted to try something lighter from my first half.  I was extremely satisfied with them after I crossed the finish line.  I was worried my feet would be aching because they are so much lighter than the Ghosts but that was not the case at all.  If I didn't live in Wisconsin I would run in these year round but I think in January my toes might freeze off. LOL.  If a couple of other colors could be added that would be awesome!,
110234,5,06/18/2017,Best shoes I have had ,

110234,5,03/21/2017,"Excellent Racers I have been training and racing in these flats for 6 months and think the world of them. They are light and responsive feeling but supportive enough where my feet feel great after a road half marathon (farthest I have raced in them). They also look stellar, currently wearing the sunset red color.",
110234,5,10/14/2016,Excellent but needs a wide size ,
110234,5,10/11/2016,"Very happy Feels very light, felt faster when I switched to these from my previous shoes (which were light, but not that light). Just completed the Chicago marathon with what would be an over 20min cushion to qualify for Boston, so I am very happy with them",
110234,1,10/03/2016,"Hole in my Hyperion! Got a huge gaping hole right above my toe right after my first run. The shoe did not feel tight, so I am not sure why a hole popped up.",
110234,5,09/09/2016,"Awesome Racing Shoe Compared to the T7, this is tight fitting, responsive and has great traction on the road.  I have run in the T7 for the last 3 years and am beyond happy with this new show",
110234,5,09/06/2016,Fantastic shoes! I love these shoes. I didn't know how I would like them at first as the previous line of shoes I ran in were discontinued. These are the closest I can find with a nice low drop,
110234,5,08/19/2016,"Amazing road racing flat I have logged about 100 miles on my first pair of Hyperions and absolutely love them so far. They are seriously light- so much so, that I can't even tell I'm wearing them during my runs. The seamless upper really helps to provide comfort and reduce weight of the shoe. Plus, the 'propulsion pods' on the soles really provide great responsiveness and energy return during fast runs. I have primarily worn them for speed work and some 10 mile training runs at easy effort. I hope to wear them for a full marathon this fall. All that being said, the Hyperion might not be for everyone. If you typically wear stability shoes or prefer a lot of cushion for longer (10+ mile) distances or training, other shoes may be a better fit for you. But if you're comfortable wearing flats for race distances up to the half marathon or marathon and you're looking for an awesome racing flat, then I couldn't recommend the hyperions enough.",
110234,1,07/28/2016,"Blisters I'm 6'4"" 190 lbs and used the Hyperion (14) with thin, flexible sports orthotics for a 5k. Felt great at first (light/fast), but got nasty blisters on top of my feet / beginning of lacing where the shoe bends. Tried again a week later with less tight lacing, same result. Returned them and kept running in my old Ravenna 6s. Could be that the orthotics aggravated the issue, but they work fine in my other shoes. Nevertheless, thanks to Brooks for their generous and convenient return policy!",
110234,5,06/02/2016,"Premier Racing Flat I had the chance to test this shoe in the 2016 Olympic Marathon Trials in LA. Because I only had the shoe for a week prior, I was nervous about using it for the full marathon. Glad I did, though! The shoe is light and quick, everything you want in a road racing shoe, but the wrap and seems are unnoticeable, as well, making it perfect for the long stuff. I have worn every racing shoe that Brooks has produced in the last 20 years, and none compare. For years, I lamented the gap between other shoe companies and Brooks in this category. Not any more!If you are serious about running fast and racing well, this is the right shoe for it.",
110235,4,12/18/2017,Great shoe just not for me The shoe is great but the problem is the back of the heel is very rigid. I found out after wearing them that I have Haglunds deformity and very hard heel surfaces cause this. My problem is just my left heel and I can't wear the shoes. Makes me sick because I just bought them. I am a nurse And i  am on my feet for 12 hrs at a time and I didn't have a problem until I did a 7 day work week. My other Brooks shoes have not caused this.,
110235,5,12/06/2017,Buy 'em! ,
110235,3,11/30/2017,"Solid shoe, but not what I was looking for I like the look, tread, slightly hardened toes box, and general feel of the shoe. I expected it to be a tighter fit on my foot, as previous brooks and other trail running shoes have been. I have long, more narrow feet, and I was hoping the fit would be more like my Pure Connect from a few years ago. I have had those shoes since 2012 and love them! They were like custom fit gloves for my feet! Anyway...I was also hoping for a little more arch support from the Mazama. I feel like my foot slides around a bit and that the shoe is fairly flat with very little arch support. This is a good, solid shoe, but it just doesn't fit my feet quite right. I'd happily recommend this shoe, but would explain the statements above.",
110235,5,11/14/2017,"Trail Racer Deluxe I love the predictable ""out of the box"" comfort and stability of the Brooks line of shoes. I have run with and for Brooks since 1990, and thus found it quite strange that  my 1st pair of Mazamas  caused a blood blister on both of my little toes during my first trail race in them; and the tread in the forefoot came off the bottom of one of the shoes.I waited about a year and ordered another pair of Mazamas,  they faired much better than the 1st pair during my first 15k  trail run in them. There was some redness but no blisters,  and the tread on both shoes looks to be in good order. These shoes are fast, responsive, and a true trail racer. They are  best for lighter, efficient runners.If you want to run fast on the trails, these are definitely your shoes.",
110235,5,11/13/2017,Perfect This is a great shoe if you are like me and do not like a lot of the over cushioning. Not only on the bottom but around the ankle and heel as well.  Shoe responds well when you contact the ground and stays comfortable on long runs.  Rides just fine on pavement as well.  My only fear is they are getting rid of it because it is on sale and I see no new version.  Time to purchase a couple extra pairs.,
110235,5,09/21/2017,"I love this shoe! I use this shoe for on and off road, short or long distances.   Train back to back long runs in same pair.  Longest run 100K trail race.  Total comfort!",
110235,5,09/13/2017,Amazing racing shoe for XC This is the shoe I use for racing on the days of our cross country meet. It grips and feels great,
110235,4,06/30/2017,"Great Shoe! I love this shoe for smooth trail running. Light, fast and comfortable.  It does run 1/2 size too big.  I wish I would have known this.  This shoe is a light weight trail racer.  I do own a pair of Cascadia and they are beefy and bomb-proof.  These are light and nimble, so I wear them accordingly.  The only real complaint I have on this shoe is they are pretty slippery when wet.  I'll wear my Cascadia if I know I'll be running rocky trails with some water.",
110235,4,05/11/2017,"Conflicted I love this shoe, but I really hate what I saw when getting these out of the box.  A very noticeable 1/8"" glue bead where the sole meets the heal.  Brooks always feels and looks nice, this was a shock given I've been an avid customer for years.  The thing I hate isn't the bead, it's that they won't send me a new pair to swap these out.  I have to return and get a refund while ordering a brand new pair.  Please note, I've not taken these even out on a run yet, they are brand new.  Better quality control and a broader return policy would do wonders.",
110235,5,05/09/2017,"Great Trail Shoe for Fast Short Runs! The Mazama feels fast and responsive. I wouldn't suggest this shoe to runners looking for a super soft ride for long distances, the Cascadia and Caldera fit those roles. This shoe is a great pick if you are speed training on trail, or plan on using them for 5k-20k trail races. I was impressed by the firm but adequate cushioning. This feels like a Launch with aggressive tread. Buy this shoe and have some fast fun, muddy runs!",
110235,1,04/17/2017,Poor quality but comfortable I bought these shoes for hiking. After less than a hundred miles the shoes compleatly fell apart. The tread fell off and the heals wore out. I used them for basic hiking and the trail conditions were not rough. I returned them thinking I got a faulty pair. The second pair is already falling apart. They were advertised as all condition shoes so I thought they would be durable. I would not buy these shoes for outdoor use. They were very comfortable though!,
110235,5,03/30/2017,Perfect Trail Runners These are much lighter than my previous trail runners and the fit is excellent. I like the superhero colors much better than the yellow/black combo.,
110235,5,02/24/2017,"Best of Both Worlds! These trail running shoes are best of both worlds! I run on the pavement and on the trails. The Mazamas provide a feel like the Launch but... what is even better... it is a trail running shoes! I recommend these shoes if you like doing both because they are very functional to do both.For example, I run in Seattle... when I go for the distance, I like to incorporate both trails and pavement running... the mazamas performs!Thank you Brooks for developing for the people who wear both hats!Cheers.",
110235,4,01/23/2017,"Crazy Toe Bumper This shoe fits 1/2 size larger (longer) than other brooks shoes; buy 1/2 size down. The fit is very snug around the mid foot that you won't slide forward even if you have a lot of room. The heel cup makes for a secure fit.  The toe box is not wide, but the fit is straight so it won't bother you even if you like wider toe boxes. The heel cushioning is a too firm. If you heel strike, I would not recommend this shoe. The forefoot cushioning is much softer and the insole is thick. This low drop design if very comfortable. It is a good shoe for forefoot strikers.  The propulsion plate makes the ride very snappy and also protects from all rocks. That and the upper make the shoe very protective despite its lightweight and fast feel.The outsole gives great traction. The lug design and the sticky rubber both make for a slip resistant ride. It is also very durable if used on trails; roads wear it down quickly. I did not get blisters while wearing this shoe even for a marathon. Despite the rugged upper, there is soft on the inside. The tongue and inner bootie are a comfortable stretchy material. The toe bumper is the best feature. It is a sturdy solid rubber piece that comes over the toes. No rock will ever hurt you. if you sprint straight into a wall, your feet will not feel it. Overall, this is a lightweight trail shoe that feels fast and protective at the same time. Disclosure: I was given a pair of Puregrits as a gift and I traded them for these Mazamas.",
110235,5,11/07/2016,"Trail Running Nirvana! The Mazama is the perfect trail shoe for fast confident runs. I have about 200 miles on them and love several things: first it is great up the trail and down! The forefoot is snug enough to allow for great downhill stride and the plate is well positioned for protection on rocky trails while providing a welcome spring to your stride.Uphill, there is still enough room in the toe box to spread out my toes as things heat up. The traction was great on the sandy, rocky, slippery trails we have here like Mt. Wilson allowing confident turns and downhill foot placement. The big bonus; it feels really good on concrete or asphalt as well! Great shoe that inspires confidence on the trail.",
110235,4,10/29/2016,"Trail Shoe I have been looking for I am a 6'2"" 205 lb runner. Have been looking for a good trail running shoe for a while. Most trail shoes are a little heavier than I like. The trails I run are commonly extremely technical and rocky, so I also have a problem with my ankle wanting to bend over during a run. This is the first trail shoe where my ankles felt very stable. I was a bit concerned when I worked out with them at the gym (to get a little bit of time in them) that they would rub my ankles, but after an 8.5 mile 'break in' session, I found this is not an issue. Only issue is the rubbing of the callous on the outside of my bit toe, but since I have had it since I was 15 and I am 55 now, it wasn't a big deal.",
110236,5,12/17/2017,Great shoe! Upgraded to  these from my Ghosts and definitely notice more a more comfortable ride.,
110236,3,12/16/2017,Size issues I had have a couple of  Ghost model tennis shoes. All were number 9. I returned two Glyceryn model because is too small. The sizes 9 and even 9.5 were small for me. This is weird since Ghost model will fit. The Brooks should advise their customers about differences in size across different models. I am more then 3 weeks without a proper tennis shoes because I am Brooks fan.,

110236,5,12/16/2017,Great cushioning Moved to Glycerin after being very disappointed in the new  Ghosts I just purchased which lost the previous level of great cushioning.,
110236,3,12/16/2017,"A good running shoe, but definitely sized incorrectly I have men's Glycerin 12 shoes in size 11 and 11.5 because I want a shoe slightly too large to give more room and comfort.  The 11.5 is more comfortable for me.  Therefore, I ordered two size 11.5 Glycerin 14's, which turned out to be EXACTLY the same size as 11 in the Glycerin 12 and clearly smaller than the 11.5 Glycerin 12.  My actual shoe size is men's 10.5, so Brooks is now a full size smaller than actual size.  The Glycerin 14's in size 11.5 are slightly too tight while Glycerin 12's in size 11.5 are perfect.  If Brooks can't even keep there own brand sized consistently (even if incorrect), they have a serious quality control problem.  Somebody at Brooks needs to start listening.",
110236,5,12/16/2017,I would buy this again and again ,
110236,2,12/14/2017,Unfortunately will have to return the shoes This shoes are last year's model and unfortunately they felt like they had sat on a shelf for a couple of years.  One shoe lace end was split and frayed and the toes were crushed and brittle on both shoes.  I will be returning them soon.  I still love my Glycerine 15s and would highly recommend them.,
110236,5,12/14/2017,"Great support I'm middle age and fairly new to running (started again about a year ago). I was running with Asics GEL Nimbus, and I'm fairly happy with them, but the Glycerin 14s give a little better support and better landing for my style (slight under pronation). They seem a little shorter than the Nimbus and tighter in the uppers, but in a good way.  I only have 10 miles on them, but so far so good.",
110236,5,12/08/2017,"My new running shoe I'm an experienced long distance runner and these are great running shoes if you need light weight cushioning. I used to run in Asics Gel Nimbus, but they kept changing every year, and this was the next shoe that worked for me after a long search. If Brooks keeps making this shoe I'll buy it forever. I have normal arches, over-pronate slightly and need the cushioning on long runs because I'm over 6 feet tall and weigh 200lbs. They run slightly smaller than other shoes. I wear normal shoe size 12 and like to go up half size in my running shoes, but these I needed to go up a full size to a 13 and they were perfect. In just a few weeks, I've broken my 5k and 10k personal bests  and going for half marathon in a month. Highly recommend!",

I went to the retailer to buy the Glycerin 15 when I thought the 14s had outlived their mileage. The retailer didn't do a really good job of getting me into the right shoe, so I went on your website and bought a second pair of identical Glycerin 14s, color and all. I'm slowly readjusting to the change since my last pair had more wear on them than I should have allowed, but I ran my 20 mile long run last weekend and had a great run. I love these shoes!",

I've had 4 pair of Glycerine shoes and all of them wear out in 2-3 months. This is my only shoe so I wear it daily. After about 3 months I can feel the side of my foot hurting as the foam on the bottom is shot. I really wish they would last longer for the price. I may have to try a different style or brand to see if they last longer.,

110236,5,10/18/2017,"Great shoe, I only buy Brooks I mainly run on a treadmill and been very pleased with all of my Brooks the last number of years.",
110236,5,10/17/2017,"I would buy this product again. A great shoe, wonderful fit. Did a 20 mile training run last Saturday, and they performed great. I have found my new favorite shoe.",
110236,5,10/17/2017,"I have two pairs. I liked them so much, I bought a second pair. Just finished my first marathon with them with no foot pain.",
110236,2,10/17/2017,It is just okay - could be sturdier ,
110236,5,10/17/2017,"The Glycerin 14 is a comfortable shoe. I have what is now a mild case of fasciitis. This shoe fits my feet well, is comfortable and helps my feet feel good.",
110236,5,10/17/2017,"I will never buy anything but Brooks again. No joke. I have used a pair of brooks before, I wore them for a backpacking trip up the east coast and walked miles and miles and miles for 2 months and they survived like a champ and I wore them for 2 years. And I got that pair from goodwill! I am cheap. But recently my feet have started to hurt from wearing junky shoes that I bought from a department store for like $20. So I decided to buy a pair of these brooks glycerine. I have a neutral foot (so the shoe store ppl tell me.) no joke, I now wear these shoes constantly. Walking around the house, all day until I go to bed, wherever I go, whenever I can. My feet hurt when I DONT wear them. I spent $104 or so after tax for these on this website and shipping was free. It was well worth swallowing that pill and I honestly will never buy anything else for a casual shoe. I WISH brooks made dress shoes, I have to wear those for work and I wish I could wear brooks 24/7. Please make a dressy shoe if you read this! I'm a skeptical person, I did my research first and looked through every pair, I don't immediately believe good reviews, especially if it sounds like a carbon copy or it was written by a computer. Take the plunge, you will not be disappointed. And they offered a 90 day return policy. Some kind of test run. Amazing 8/5 stars. #ReviewSweeps",
110236,4,10/16/2017,Good product. ,
110236,5,10/16/2017,Great running shoes! Second pair I ordered. Loved them so much the first time that I bought them again.,
110236,5,10/16/2017,"Even better than I had wished for Broke it in easy with one 4 mile run then another 6 mile run. ""On the third day..."" broke it open with a 18.5 mile run; felt even better than I had hoped.",
110236,3,10/16/2017,Comfy doesn't mean good. I run 15-20 miles weekly. This shoe creates a callous and on long runs a blister at inside base of my big toe joint.  Ran a half marathon yesterday and though I never had a foot blister in any prior marathon or 1/2M this time I had the same blister on both feet. I also feel that though the shoe feels comfy it has too little arch support for serious runners.,
110236,4,10/16/2017,"Very comfortable #ReviewSweepsI have had a few pairs of glycerines and I love them. These are a little more narrow than the pairs I have had prior, but nevertheless they are awesome as well. I put them on and ran 9 miles out of the box, it is amazing how good they felt on run one. Only thing I noticed is they seem to be a half size smaller than the other glycerines, cause my toes are cramped.",
110236,5,10/14/2017,"I would buy this product again.  great shoe. I use this product to walk 3 miles every day.  It is a great shoe.  After wearing the shoe for a while, I bought a second pair to have when the first one wore out.  I would highly recommend this shoe. #ReviewSweeps",
110236,5,10/14/2017,Plush and comfy. I am just getting back into running. He shoe is excellent on the short runs I take and confortable for one whose knees get sore easily.,
110236,5,10/14/2017,Planning on buying more ,
110236,5,10/13/2017,"Would get again Was replacing old Glycerines and first got Ghost 10 which were very comfortable but not as much as old Glycerines.  Got these Glycerine 14s and they feel much more comfortable to excercise walk and run in.  Feel more ""padded"" and protects my heel better.",
110236,5,10/13/2017,Best Shoe! I love this shoe!  I started wearing the Glycerin with the 9 model and have been wearing the Glycerin ever since.  Have trained for 3 marathons using the Glycerin.,
110236,4,10/13/2017,I would buy it 1/2 of size bigger Size.... because it runs about 1/2 size smaller it does not feel as comfortable as my ghosts or adrenaline....,
110236,5,10/12/2017,This product is Superb love the shoes and cust. Service ! I am a nurse I wear them everyday ! They support my feet as I am on them 8 and sometimes 13 hrs a day ! I don't have any pressure areas while walking and my calfs don't hurt . My instep with my orthotics fits well and my heel fits deep enough in the shoe do it does not slip out! I will buy more also great assistance at Brooks !,
110236,5,10/12/2017,Nice shoes ,
110236,5,10/12/2017,"I'm back... Wore Glycerins about 3 years ago, had 3 pair.  They were ok but all had same quality issue,  the outside toe box wore out a hole after only a few miles (< 100 miles).Went back and forth with other models, Pureflow/Ghosts were go to.  Started running linger distance so needed more cushion and went to Hoka.Great shoe, very comfortable.  I saw the Glycerin 14 on sale at brooks.com so thought I'd give them another chance.Fantastic!  I'm back.  This G 14 has all the comfort and efficiency I've always depended on for Brooks.  This shoe fits my foot perfect and enhances my gait.WooHoo!",
110236,5,10/10/2017,I am a fan of the Glycerin 14 This is my second Glycerin. I had it's predecessor and was very pleased. With the 14 it feels a little lighter and snug around the ankles but not to tight which is great. I even think the shoelaces are lighter. I put about 500 miles on my previous Glycerin which is more than is recommended held up well against the wear and tear. I love the design and color of the one I got. I always recommend Brooks to anyone looking to upgrade their running shoes. The biggest hurdle is the price. I had to accept to get shoes I need to spend the money and you definitely get what you pay for. If you pay 50 bucks for running shoes expect a light shoe but only last 150 miles. Your chins will be killing you as well! Make the investment in shoes especially These shoes! #ReviewSweeps,
110236,5,10/10/2017,"I'm a fan of the Glycerin The Glycerin was my second Brooks shoe that I've owned, and since I've been running in the Glycerin it will be hard for me to go with another shoe. I put 500 miles on the Glycerin 13, so getting these I expected the same. Instead I got a lighter feel and more snug on the ankles. Not much has changed which was good. I think the shoelaces are different. Regardless I always recommend Brooks to anyone that just started running but more importantly go to a local store to get fitted. I've already put about 20 miles on this shoe and i love the upgrades to the shoe and the feel hasn't changed much. #ReviewSweeps",
110236,5,10/10/2017,Love it! ,
110236,4,10/10/2017,"Snug as as a rug The shoe is an excellent choice for me. I usually wear a 10, purchased 10 1/2 and it still seems snug! But is comfortable, which is what I wanted...",
110236,5,10/10/2017,I love this shoe The shoe is responsive and worked great with no rubbing or blisters right out of box without a break in period.,
110236,5,10/10/2017,Great shoes! This shoe fits me like a glove. With the gel insoles they are perfect.  #Reviewsweeps,
110236,2,10/09/2017,"Not what I hoped for After reading the reviews and attracted by the sale price I decided to take a chance hoping they would fit/feel similar to my recently purchased Ghost 10's.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for me as the fit is too tight and my feet hurt after wearing them.  WIll be returning them.  Probably get another pair of Ghost 10's if I can find them on sale.",
110236,5,10/08/2017,"Brooks runs away with my trophy I use these shoes everywhere mountain biking, walking, in the gym. They are by far my favorite shoes that feel like they mold to my feet. I've wore several upper end shoes but nothing compares to my brooks!",
110236,5,10/07/2017,"The Only Shoe I Ever Buy, 4 Years And Counting! This is seriously the only shoe I ever buy/wear. I have a history of plantar fasciitis and also sciatica and these shoes eliminate my discomfort. I am a nurse so I'm on my feet for 12 hours a day and they help me be able to do my job. Highly recommend this shoe!",

110236,4,10/06/2017,"good shoe, good service This is the first time in a long time where I've had to return shoes because they fit small. I like the shoe, found replacements in the next size up, so that's a good thing, just very unusual experience with a shoe being small. I say this based on wearing Adrenaline and Raveena for the last 5+ years without this problem. Need to also add, great customer service and return policy.",

110236,5,09/27/2017,"Definitely my favorite of the Brooks that I've tried. Fits great, feels great, runs great. I've tried the ghosts, the glycerins, the pure flows and a number of other brands. Brooks is the best I've tried, and these are my favorite Brooks",
110236,4,09/26/2017,"I like the glycerim but will look for the next one I use to have other Glycerin versions and needed to replace a pair of running shoes,  was not impressed with this model but will look into the 15 and see how they work for me.I felt that my previous Glycerin had more toe room and felt more cushioned than this model.",
110236,5,09/26/2017,I would I first used walking round Disney World last winter.  After hours on my feet I realize thses should be my running shoes.  I beleive the fit and custioning has prevented injury.,
110236,5,09/26/2017,"Great comfortable shoe - not cheap I've had problems with hairline fractures in my feet.  I play baseball, tennis, basketball and neighborhood street football.  Although these shoes aren't built for lateral movement I am tied to the comfort and they work well with my orthotics.  My only gripe is that they wear out quickly with the kind of activity I do (I'm lucky to get 3 months out of them and they are super expensive).  If Brooks has another shoe that has this kind of cushioning in a cross trainer or tennis shoe I'd love to hear about it.  I don't even wear my basketball shoes anymore.",
110236,5,09/25/2017,Love them ,

110236,5,09/22/2017,Fantastic Kicks! Great shoes! Comfortable and bouncy. Has allowed me to increase my weekly mileage and run duration 20-25% in the past 3 months with ease. I like the shoes so much I bought a second pair as back up.,
110236,5,09/21/2017,"Comfortable shoes Very cushioned ride, formed to my feet after only a couple runs. I would say these are easily in the top 3 of my favorite running shoes I've owned.",

I ran two miles four days a week from 1979 to 1992; when my back and hips began to hurt, I starting walking two miles four days a week to 2005; from 2005 to now, I have walked two miles every day.  I've had a LOT of different shoes, mainly Saucony--the Triumph.",

110236,5,09/12/2017,"Perfect for Long Slow Distance for the overweight runner Check the sizes on these,  our feet change and models change. Saying that I've run several marathons and trust the Brooks Glycerin model to keep my feet pain free and strong. I get 200 miles out of them which is not a lot but it's worth it. I'm 6'1 240 lbs and it's hard to find the right footwear! So, if it works, stick with it till it doesn't work anymore.",
110236,5,09/10/2017,"Excellent running shoe I'm 6'2"" 195lbs long distance runner with a weak left ankle. This is a great running shoe that provides the perfect amount of cushion upon each step. It's very supportive around the foot that gives great stability; nice cushion base that prevents a rough run on the joints (ankles/knees); very high quality product (well made). I have had other major brands (would have stuck with mazuno but they seemed to cheap out their product in recent years) and this is an extremely solid shoe! This is my second pair of glycerin 14's this year because I have already put approximately  300-400 miles on my first pair and even my first pair still has some life left in them regarding cushion and support. Would highly recommend this shoe!",
110236,4,09/07/2017,"A good shoe for me but one shoe has a flaw I have worn the glycerine 12, 13, and this is my second pair of 14s. I tried another brand in between 13 and 14 and I was getting tingling in the toes after ten miles. Feet feel good after long runs in these. I'm 195 with a bit of lumbering stride and I like the cushioning. The only issue I've had is that one of the shoes appears to have less cushioning in the forefoot than the other. I thought it might be my feet, but I don't feel it in the other pair of 14s. If I had accurate calipers I would measure. Its enough of a difference that it throws off my stride a bit. Not sure how they do quality control.",
110236,4,09/07/2017,I would buy this product again I have two pairs of glycerin 14s now. These ones seem different. I like them less than the grey/silver with lime/yellow. they feel tighter and there is an odd irregularity over the heel. I still like them tho. Glycerin 11s and 13s are my favorite so far. I have a pair of 15's too. I think they are better than the 14's overall.,
110236,5,09/05/2017,"Great cushioned shoe for the fat guy on a long run It's hard to find the right shoe for a 250lb 6""1 marathoner however this is it. Very strange how the model shrunk or my feet got bigger   Don't known whitch one happened   But glad I'm in the 12s now. Last year the 11 was ok. Go figure",
110236,3,09/03/2017,"Hope they last better than 13s The Glycerin 14s feel excellent, just like all my previous Glycerins.  My 13s lasted only about three months.  More important than the three months, they probably only had about 20 miles on them (and that is generous mileage number).  I was recovering from a surgery, so I was not running, just doing PT, and walking on a treadmill.  Fortunately, the 14s lasted longer than 20 miles.....  I have been wearing the Glycerins for years (first pair was Glycerin 8s), and it seems like every new versions dies quicker than the last.   When I had the issue with the 13s, I called customer service, she was very nice, but they were not able to do anything, and it seemed like they have received this call numerous times.  She stated she would send the feedback to the R & D Dept.  I hope she sent the information to R & D, and I hope they read this review.  I used to walk into my local running store, quickly verify the Glycerins still fit great, and that was that.  As a result of their short lifespans, I am going to try on Saucony and Asics before I buy the 15s.  And if they feel good, my string of buying Glycerins will come to an end.",
110236,5,09/01/2017,"Glycerin's, like me, are forgiving, yet supportive. This is my 4th generation of Glycerin shoes, going back to the 11's. I think these are the best overall model to date. I like how light and flexible  the upper is compared to older versions. Excellent tread durability.",

Subjunctive mode; 6th grade English.I am older and have had a number of Brooks shoes.  I wear them for comfort and not for working out.  I had terrible luck and would not recommend your old Model 11 Glycerin  shoes.  This model had a totally inferior upper body mesh type material that stretched, quickly frizzed up, holes appeared and immediately wore out with out being subjected to any work out ware. I almost left Brooks because of this model.  More current models 13 & 14 have a different upper body material and are reinforced much better.  As a result, they hold their shape and do not quickly disintegrate. I very much appreciate the construction/design and qualities of the sole, insole, arch support and balance of the shoe.  Hence, a quality product.",
110236,5,08/31/2017,"My go to sneaker from now on!! All I can say is WOW!! I have always been a true Nike fan since 1988. But lately, Nike are not providing the support and comfort as they did. During a visit to the foot doctor, he suggested the Brooks Glycerin sneaker for an upcoming trip to Disney World. He told me that they would help with my knees and ankles especially walking all day through the parks. He was not kidding!! This is one of the best, most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn. The fit, feel and spring like action it gives with every step is far superior than any Nike or other running shoes I have ever tried on. Great shoe and I will never buy any other shoe besides Brooks Glycerin from now on  !",

110236,1,08/26/2017,"Wears out FAST!! I am on my second pair of the Glycerin 14. For the first pair, the bottom of the shoe was worn completely smooth on the heel and toe. Also showing signs of wear throughout the whole shoe. This was after only 110 miles! I filed a defective product claim. Didn't hear anything for a week so I decided to return them to the store. Since I had a race coming up I decided to go with the same shoe. I'm getting the same results. (I wasn't really expecting anything different) It's a very comfortable shoe. It just wears out way too fast. So that's my reason for 1 star. If I could, I would rate the Brooks Company zero stars. I filed the claim August 10th and have not heard from them yet. It's August 26th. This is my first pair of Brooks. (I used to run Asics) and may be my last.",

110236,5,08/22/2017,Love the Glycerin series I have been running in the Glycerins for a few years. My feet haven't hurt since changing to them. I have always wore a 9.5 until this year. The 12 & 13 were both the same. In the 14 series I had to buy a whole size larger. I think there is something different in the design but I love the comfort they give me on those long runs.,

I enjoy the exceptional cushion since my feet are extra sensitive and this shoe has a marvelous way of giving great comfort but maintaining a firm step whether flat road or trails.  I tried on several brands and models and discovered the Glycerin 14 solved all my needs and looks good, too.  Well thought out design.  My feet thank you!",

Management consultants got their hands on it because it was an award winner. They began an cutting corners and in 2 years destroyed the Glycerin line.",
110236,5,06/19/2017,"Excellent neutral shoe! I had to go up a half-size (normally 12.5 and went to 13).  I have narrow feet so the normal width was great for me.  I went away from Brooks for 1 year when the Ghosts felt too wide for my feet.  The Glycerins have more a snug, comfortable fit.  They also took away what other calf pain I received from 3 other neutral brands of shoes I tried.  I plan to stick with Glycerins in the future based on this great experience!",

110236,2,06/07/2017,"Perfection for a very short time...... Gee, I really wish that I could give a rating for 100 miles in a shoe.  If that were the case this would get a perfect score.  Really, really comfortable for longer runs with fantastic cushioning out of the gate.  Problem is it didn't take long to reach a noticeable drop in the cushioning. For me it was about one month in with an average of 26 miles per week.  Not sure if my pair was an anomaly but am disappointed with the breakdown in cushioning.  All other aspects are spot-on.  Great fit (make sure you go 1/2 size up) nice balance, smooths out uneven surfaces like broken tarmac - that is - for about a month.  I had run in purely Brooks Ghost before this (several pairs over the years).  Thought this would be the way to go as my knees started aging, but may need to look outside of Brooks.",

I was ready to send them back but decided to give them the 90 day evaluation.I'm glad I did.After lacing them up properly it fixed the sizing problem and they fit great. I took them for a three mile test spin on the treadmill because of bad weather and the shoes quickly adapted to my stride and delivered a well cushioned comfortable ride and just the right amount of arch support (I'm transitioning from the Adrenaline). In my opinion, the shoes DO require some breaking-in (initial stiffness), but man am I glad I bought these.

110236,4,01/22/2017,"Great shoe, but possibly suspect quality control I have been wearing Brooks for 15+ years and while I have tried a few of the Ravenna line, for the most part I have been an Adrenaline wearer.  I recently decided to try the Glycerin 14s since even though the Brooks shoe configure thing always says the Adrenaline is for me, I am an underpronator and wanted to try a cushion shoe.I wear a size 11 shoe, so I always get a 12 in my running shoes.  The Glycerin 14s that I ordered from Brooks fit perfectly and feel great on the road and on the treadmill.  Prior to receiving my order however, I saw some Glycerin 14s in the store and tried them on to find they were WAY too small.  Despite being tagged as a size 12, they were so tight they felt like a 10.5.  I have seen a lot of reviews of this shoe on Brooks' site saying ""too small"" so I have to question the overall quality control of the factory.  Given my experience and the number of reviews that report the tight cut, I wonder if they had some manufacturing issues and instead of trashing the ill-sized shoes, are just passing them off as normal.Bottom line: great shoe, but don't be shocked if the ones you receive aren't cut right.",

Up until the Glycerin 14s I would say this has been the best running shoe I have ever tried.  The Glycerin 14 fits almost like the Ghost.  The toe box is very narrow and is very uncomfortable.  I am very upset with the toe box change.  I've bought several Glycerin 13's to last me until the 15's come out.  Hopefully they will go back to the large toe box.,

I wear a custom insole and it works well in these.The only issue with the 14 is the sizes seems to have gotten smaller by half a size. I usually wear a 10, but went with a 10.5 instead.

I feel best running in neutral shoes like the Ghost 9 (amazing shoe!!!), but I felt the run in the new Glycerin 14 was too squishy for me.  Super comfortable for standing and walking all day at work but not responsive enough for me on a run.  If you are looking for hyper-cushioning, then it might be the shoe for you.

110236,5,06/28/2016,Best Glycerin yet! Was never a big fan of the color combos on the Glycerin 13.  That led to me wearing/buying multiple Glycerin 12's and using them over the last 2+ years.  The minute I saw these a snatched them up.  After wearing the first month I knew I needed a second pair.  I have been alternating shoes each run and they are holding up great... both still look new.  I'm not a long runner (20-25 miles a week) but my feet feel great after my 5 mile runs.  I feel like the Glycerin were made for my feet! Can do nothing but recommend you try a pair.,
110236,3,06/28/2016,"Wide, otherwise nice I purchased Glycerine 13s a few months ago, and decided to try the 14s recently. I have a narrow foot, so I was happy that the 13s fit so well. I figured the 14s would, as well. However, whereas the 13s fit right out of the box, the 14s were wider and my foot slides around a bit. I can still use the shoe without blisters, etc., but the added width makes them less comfortable, as I have to wrench down on the laces to tie the 14s.   The 14 is a nice shoe, otherwise. The foot-bed is comfortable, the construction seems sound, and the colors are sharp. I also notice that my knees hurt much less with the Glycerines (both the 13s and 14s) than with other runners, so the cushioning does its job.If the width was not such an issue for me, I'd probably give this shoe a 4 or 5 star rating. So, you might like it more than I do if your feet are not narrow.",

110236,1,06/13/2016,"Why change a great shoe? I have worn out 3 pair of Brooks Glycerin 12's and 2 pair of Glycerin 11's. When I started running several years ago my heels and Achilles ached the day after a long run. I thought it was age and weight. A saleswoman at a local running store put me in Brooks Glycerin and the pain stopped almost immediately. She even taught me a different way to lace the shoe to accommodate my high arch without causing my toes to become numb.  Every pair fit and felt great UNTIL the Glycerin 14's. I skipped over the 13's after reading reviews and bought a couple of pair online. The 14's felt ok but not like the others. I ran two times in them for 5 miles each time. The next morning my pain was back in my heels and Achilles. I went back to my old 12's with no pain. I am a big guy, 6' 4'' and up to 200 pounds. Glycerin used to be a big guy shoe but not for me anymore.",

110236,5,06/01/2016,"cushioned, resilient, durable, responsive, high mileage I fully disclose that a pair of Glycerin 14s were given to me for free with the expectation that I write an honest review of them. In addition, I was a wear tester for several pairs of Glycerin 14s. Thank you Brooks! I love these shoes and have accumulated over 500 miles on each of my test shoes. I find the Glycerin 14 to be an excellent, well cushioned, resilient, durable, responsive, high mileage training shoe that has good traction and excellent comfort. The stretch upper material is a major improvement from previous Glycerin models. The upper material reminds me of spandex or tights (for the legs) specific for your feet. I did not notice any binding, pitching, or folding of the upper material. It moves, gives, and contracts with your foot movement.The Glycerin 14 shoe is an improvement over the Glycerin 13's in my assessment of heel comfort, and flexibility.  The flexibility or stretch of the upper material I feel is a major improvement. The shoe has superior flexibility (Midsole and outsole) in the midfoot to heel region in the medial or lateral or heel to toe directions compared to the Glycerin 13, which was an improvement over the Glycerin 12's.  This gives the shoe a much better feel of power in every stride and traction when running on and off road. I like the new feel or ride of the Glycerin 14.  For me, the shoes make a sound when you run in them. I attribute this sound to the improved traction and flexibility.Comfort: I did not develop any foot pain, toe pain, blisters, soreness, pressure points and remained injury free during compiling 521 miles these shoes.Cushioning: The shoe had excellent cushioning as assessed by the lack of feeling rocks, roots, road and changes in surfaces during compiling 420 miles in these shoes. At higher mileage, the cushion began to decrease to about 60% out of the box feel at 521 miles.Resiliency/response: The resilience of the shoe was excellent out of the box and was still excellent (~95% out of box) after compiling 250 miles in these shoes. This is based on feel during running (bouncy) and drop test. If I drop the shoes from a height of ~3 feet with the forefoot region hitting onto a hard surface they bounce up approximately just over one and a half foot. After 420 miles the resilience began to decrease to approximately 80% of out of box at 521 miles.Durability: Forefoot durability was subjectively estimated to be 85% of outer sole thickness (toe off region) after compiling 200 miles in these shoes. The midfoot and heel were approximately 90-95% at 200 miles. At approximately 400 miles, the outersole wore through to the midsole at toe off or in the fore foot. The midfoot and heel outer sole were approximately 50% at maximum wear areas. At 521 miles, the forefoot wore through the midsole and the DNA (90%) at toe off. The lateral midfoot touch down area was approximately 90% worn and the lateral heal was approximately 40% worn. The upper material showed only minor wear at my little toe region. Glycerin 12 and earlier models for me have worn holes in the upper material at my little toe region beginning at approximately 400 miles.Bottom line, I would recommend this shoe as a high mileage training shoe. I hope this helps you with choosing your next pair of shoes.",

110236,5,05/31/2016,"excellent, cushioned, resilient, durable, responsive,miles I fully disclose that a pair of Glycerin 14s were given to me for free with the expectation that I write an honest review of them. In addition, I was a wear tester for several pairs of Glycerin 14s. Thank you Brooks! I love these shoes and have accumulated over 500 miles on each of my test shoes. I find the Glycerin 14 to be an excellent well cushioned, resilient, durable, responsive, high mileage training shoe that has good traction and excellent comfort. The stretch upper material is a major improvement from previous Glycerin models. The upper material reminds me of spandex or tights (for the legs) specific for your feet. I did not notice any binding, pitching, or folding of the upper material. It moves, gives, and contracts with your foot movement.The Glycerin 14 test shoe is an improvement over the Glycerin 13's in my assessment of heel comfort, and flexibility.  The flexibility or stretch of the upper material I feel is a major improvement. The shoe has superior flexibility (Midsole and outsole) in the midfoot to heel region in the medial or lateral or heel to toe directions compared to the Glycerin 13, which was an improvement over the Glycerin 12's.  This gives the shoe a much better feel of power in every stride and traction when running on and off road. I like the new feel or ride of the Glycerin 14.  For me, the shoes make a sound when you run in them. I attribute this sound to the improved traction and flexibility.Comfort: I did not develop any foot pain, toe pain, blisters, soreness, pressure points and remained injury free during compiling 521 miles these shoes.Cushioning: The shoe had excellent cushioning as assessed by the lack of feeling rocks, roots, road and changes in surfaces during compiling 420 miles in these shoes. At higher mileage, the cushion began to decrease to about 60% out of the box feel at 521 miles.Resiliency/response: The resilience of the shoe was excellent out of the box and was still excellent (~95% out of box) after compiling 250 miles in these shoes. This is based on feel during running (bouncy) and drop test. If I drop the shoes from a height of ~3 feet with the forefoot region hitting onto a hard surface they bounce up approximately just over one and a half foot. After 420 miles the resilience began to decrease to approximately 80% of out of box at 521 miles.Durability: Forefoot durability was subjectively estimated to be 85% of outer sole thickness (toe off region) after compiling 200 miles in these shoes. The midfoot and heel were approximately 90-95% at 200 miles. At approximately 400 miles, the outersole wore through to the midsole at toe off or in the fore foot. The midfoot and heel outer sole were approximately 50% at maximum wear areas. At 521 miles, the forefoot wore through the midsole and the DNA (90%) at toe off. The lateral midfoot touch down area was approximately 90% worn and the lateral heal was approximately 40% worn. The upper material showed only minor wear at my little toe region. Glycerin 12 and earlier models for me have worn holes in the upper material at my little toe region beginning at approximately 400 miles.Bottom line, I would recommend this shoe as a high mileage training shoe. I hope this helps you with choosing your next pair of shoes.Run Happy! Run for life!",
110236,5,05/28/2016,"Got to test these bad boys for free!! I got the new Glycerin 14s from brooksrunning.com to try for free for and honest review. I am a glycerin fan and have been ever since I put the 11s on my feet a couple of years ago.I am 6'2 230 lbs and the glycerins give me the support and comfort I need. What sets the new 14s apart from the rest of the models especially the 13s and I'm guessing at this,is the added support in the mid sole and also noticed this shoe is a little taller than the rest because of it. This change has made the new 14s a smoother ride and the comfort and stability is second to none. Brooks has also made some other changes that I noticed like the 3d stretch print which is as advertised for a more custom fit, I noticed this the first time I went for a jog my feet did not slide or move inside the shoe at all.Brooks hit a home run with this year's shoe and is definitely an upgrade.I recommend this shoe to anyone who needs a good comfortable cushioned shoe!!",
110239,5,12/20/2017,I would buy these again and again! I wear these trail running and they are by far my favorite shoes. They are very light and comfortable!,
110239,2,12/02/2017,Sorry- did not like these ,
110239,4,12/02/2017,"Don't regret the purchase, but not a perfect shoe This shoe was my first trail running shoe to ever purchase. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase, however, they were pretty slippery at first. Could hardly walk on rocks without slipping! But as I wear them more and more, this issue has resolved. Besides that, I've had a great time running in these.",
110239,5,11/20/2017,"Great shoe Great shoe. Light weight yet very stable. If I had to be picky, they have changed the upper for a better more resilient material but seems to be slightly more snug around the forefoot height/width wise. If I loosen laces all the way they just fit. Older models this wasn't an issue.",
110239,3,11/19/2017,"Not Nearly As Comfortable As My Other Brooks The shoe and especially the tongue are just weird. They're comfortable, but nowhere near as comfortable as my Ghost 9's or Glycerine.",

110239,5,10/16/2017,"My second time buying PureGrit for trail running. Love them! Have tried several trail running shoes by other makers but this is, by far, my favorite. I'm done searching for something that I like better. These are the truth!",
110239,4,09/30/2017,"Good trail shoe! Great shoe!  Comfortable enough for me to run an easy 10k in right out of the box.  I run on a hard packed gravel trails that can included dirt paths and wood bridges.  The outer sole is very grippy, but not super stiff and clunky.  Love the low drop from heel to toe.  The upper material seems to breathe well too.  I also use the Brooks Pure Cadence which fit similar, my only dislike is the toe box for me feel a tad narrow on the Pure Grit.",
110239,4,09/22/2017,Tongamoa I really recommend the shoes to anybody that workout or love going on long Hikes because they are very conferrable while you are doing those exercise also they great for going out shoes to like movies or with friends anywhere.,
110239,4,09/15/2017,Great buy ,
110239,3,08/28/2017,"Solid Trail Shoe, not my fave Plenty of grip and the rock plate adds protection on the tough trails. But the toe box feels a little big for my liking and I could do with just a bit more cushion. Overall, I don't feel very fast in them.",
110239,5,08/09/2017,I absolutely love this product. Have recommended to friends. ,

110239,5,06/26/2017,"Amazing traction Used these for a 20mi OCR, basically out of the box. They were fantastic. Amazing grip, light, and drained very well.",
110239,1,06/11/2017,I returned the PureGrit 5 shoes.  They were too narrow a fit ,
110239,1,05/05/2017,"Does not fit like my Puregrit 3 The shoe was uncomfortable and they caused me to alter my step enough to aggravate my slightly unstable right knee. I won a pair of Pure Grit 3s and they are very comfortable, the 5s laces stop very high on the shoe and cut into the top of my foot. I returned them after 2 attempts at wearing them for a light run.",
110239,5,04/09/2017,"My boyfriend loves these, birthday present success! ",
110239,4,03/01/2017,"At home in the mud I was sent the Pure Grit 5 by Brooks as a replacement of the Pure Grit 4's that fell apart on me after two months of wearing. I also used a pair of Pure Grit 3 for two years of trail running and they are still in relatively good shape. I must say that the 5 are true to the series. They give you good trail feel while still providing some cushion from the rock and roots, they are also still quite nimble for the technical stuff. I have put on about 75 trail running miles over 6 runs all of them muddy all of them wet and the PG5s have performed amazingly, they dry quickly, they grip while wet and they protect my feet. My only compliant is the common one about the tongue being weird, once you get it in the right spot it is fine but it is a bit weird. Also they are not quite as comfy as the PG4 but the PG5 is not falling apart so I would say it is a improvement.",
110239,5,12/20/2016,"great looks and comfort every one is complementing on it, looks so stylish and very comfy too. Love the new color too, I think I'll get my 2nd pair.",
110239,4,12/08/2016,"Good shoe with flaws Had same shoe, Puregrit 4, and upper outside toe area failed at about 150 miles.  The shoes store replaced them with the ""5"".  The change from the ""honeycomb"" upper to a solid overlay hopefully with solve that.  I like the tongue design of the old shoe better.  More substantial and cushioning.  The new design is paper thin and the two  lace loops on tongue are annoying.  One was fine.The shoe does feel good and works well on the trails.  I was looking for a more ""minimal"" support shoe with out going extreme minimalist which I tried and felt it was too far of a swing from the over supported running shoes we have been subject to for decades.",

110241,3,12/24/2017,"Not a Shoe for Wet Conditions I recently returned to Brooks after experiencing repetitive durability problems with another brand. This shoe has been great in dry conditions, but forget about using this shoe on wet asphalt. Running on wet asphalt in this shoe is like running on ice, and I'm not exaggerating, I've spent a lot of time running on ice. It is worth nothing that it handles fine on most concrete surfaces. I would give the shoe five stars, and would also recommend it to friends, if it wasn't so terrible on wet asphalt.",

Now, I ordered the Adrenaline model and though it is marked as a 13, the fit indicates that it is actually a 12 1/2. This indicates to me there is a lack of quality control. If this is the trend for the future, I would recommend that you start building a size 13 1/2 shoe.",

Thankfully, Brooks is honoring their return guarantee, and I'll be getting a wider pair.I recently bought/ran in a normal width pair for a 12-mile run.

110241,5,12/21/2017,Great product. Thanks ,
110241,1,12/20/2017,I am very disappointed The soles are already wearing out and I have had the shoes only a few weeks. I am very disappointed and may look into other brands after being a Brooks runner for over 35 years.,
110241,5,12/19/2017,Happy I could still get the 17's. I wish you would continue the 17's. 18's are not true to size. Toe box is different and irritates my toes. Hoping to get back to some running after an ankle problem. Adrenalines help.,
110241,3,12/18/2017,Returning ,
110241,4,12/17/2017,Very good wearing. Like very much ,
110241,5,12/16/2017,Very satisfied I've been running for the past 35 years and throughout this time I have tried many styles and brands of footwear. So far Brooks are among my favorites for overall comfort and ride. Brooks have become my go to brand for overall performance for street or trail. Thanks to the brooks design team for making a great shoe!,

110241,4,12/12/2017,"I got rhyth in these shoes I bought two pairs, one for work and one to walk.  For me they are great at work as I am on my feet 70% of the day.  They have good support good cushioning and great fit.",
110241,5,12/12/2017,Great shoe. Very stable I bought this shoe because I am going to start running again and I need something that will support my weight as I weigh 220 lbs.,
110241,3,12/11/2017,"Narrow and stiff I reviewed 5 stars before. They seemed supportive at first, but as the day went on, I noticed they felt too narrow through the midfoot. I hope the compress a bit, as it isn't very comfortable. I have a C width 12 foot, and sized up to a 12.5 as brooks runs small. Their Ravenna and this model are much more narrow through the midfoot. Brooks needs to keep their midfoots at D width, and have a lower stack height. They also could benefit from a medium-low footbed height in some models.",
110241,5,12/10/2017,Love them!!! ,

110241,5,12/01/2017,"Buy the shoe! re-posting since I purchase 2 pair. I discovered this shoe a couple of years ago. I was a die hard Reebok fan. In recent years, they've changed their shoes and my feet/body got older. I needed a really good shoe with excellent support. When I wear this shoe, it makes my ENTIRE body wake up and feel absolutely fabulous. I just re-purchased 2 pairs. Well worth the money spent. As long as they don't change this shoe, I will be a Brooks fan from here on!!!",

110241,5,11/29/2017,"Best shoe I've found - and I've tried alot Shoes are so finicky.   What is great to one person, is a nightmare to others.My case:   I've had a bad case of plantar fasciitis.  It took me four months to figure out that tight hips were pressing on the sciatica nerve which was causing heel pain.  No amount of heel stretching or icing or cortisone helped.   Stretching my hips and hamstrings worked wonders, after the PTs figured out what was going on.Brooks Adrenalines are the most comfortable shoes I have found.  Perfect for me.  They are snug in the heel, and wide in the toes for a great fit for people like me with a normal arch.  Most other shoes are tight in the toes, and loose in the heel.  I am a slight supinator, or someone who wears down the outside of the shoe first.  I don't know why, but these are just right (for me).",

110241,5,11/28/2017,"Great shoe I haven't been able to run in these very much as of yet, but it feels like a great shoe.  I've worn a few other brands, but I plan to stick with Brooks.",
110241,4,11/27/2017,"Love the shoe but it's dead in a month I really love running in this shoe the first couple weeks. It starts to break down really fast after that. By the forth week they are done; the tread is pretty much gone, the cushioning isn't there anymore. I'm lucky if I can make it four solid weeks. I run about a 60-70 a week which might be considered a little high but the shoe should last at least 300 miles. I wish I could get two months out of it. I'd never wear another shoe if so.",

110241,3,11/26/2017,"Durability I love the fit and comfort of the GTS-17, however  I have found that the soles show increased wear at about 250 miles compared to the previous models. I would be happy if they would last 350 miles since 98% of mileage is from running",

110241,5,11/22/2017,"Very well designed shoe Great supports and design. Keeps my feet planted and improved stability. I like how it's not a pointy shoe cramming tors together, had a more natural appearance (wide toe box) for how human feet actually look.",
110241,5,11/22/2017,Love the Adrenaline GTS 17's! This is my third pair of 17's this year. Brooks is always doing some tweaking from year to year; sometimes they do it right and sometimes they don't. They got it right with the 17's.(I've been in the Adrenaline line since the 00 model :-)  )Had to buy this Rock 'n Roll version. Love that Brooks does these funky things from time to time!,
110241,3,11/21/2017,Okay but previous models were better The shoes look great. But for the 2017 model they apparently increased the arch support which was almost too much (for me). I felt a sharp pain in my arch when running. That's the reason I didn't buy other models because they had too much support. The 2018 model feels better in the adrenaline as they lowered it.,
110241,1,11/20/2017,Shoe is falling apart The parts under the shoe are coming off. It's as if the glue does not hold well. I am not an avid runner and only use them maybe 2-3 times a week for general walking.,
110241,5,11/20/2017,Nothing but Brooks I switched to Brooks looking for a true fit and comfort many moons ago and this last one bought reminded me again why I keep on returning to the brand. I bought another brand a few days before my last purchase and I have already donated it to charity.,
110241,5,11/20/2017,Takes a bit to break in but once they are... Once broken in they are fantastic. Took about 85 miles though. Run a bit small but sized up a half size and they feel great,
110241,5,11/19/2017,Love ,
110241,5,11/19/2017,Excellent as usual. Just an outstanding shoe. It has a wonderful bounce that makes walking and light jogging pleasurable. I plan on purchasing another pair soon.,

110241,4,11/17/2017,"I have been a Loyal Brooks Customer for over 26 years. TY Brooks are my go to running shoe, if they did not fit, I would go to somewhere else, and I have been on the Brooks band wagon for over 26 years",
110241,5,11/17/2017,Great. Will Buy It Again! I've been in a Brook's for several years now.  It's my daily shoe.  My last two pair were Addiction 10 and 12.  Decided to try Adrenaline this time and they're great too!,
110241,5,11/16/2017,Great shoe! I really like the comfort and fit of the shoe. It is a little different than the 16 model. The 17 feels like it has more room in the toe box. I plan on buying another pair before they are gone.,
110241,4,11/16/2017,They are okay but quality has slipped The right shoe finish on the inside has glue in it making it feel short. We have tried to get it out. Also the inner sole leaves a lot to be desired forcing you to spend another $50 getting a decent on with Support. Overall it is a good tennis shoe but Brooks needs to improve quality. Just not as good as the exact same shoe I replaced. But better than Nike. Not as good as New Balance but much lighter. So I keep buying them. I need a narrow shoe and this is Brooks shoe that comes in a B width.,
110241,5,11/15/2017,"Welcome back old friend I used to run everyday for cross country and track in highschool.  At that time I was recommend an Adrenaline GTS 7 Shoe by my local shop (Runners Hi in Aiea,Hawaii). and all through out my high school running career I would use a Adrenaline GTS shoe. In college I didn't have the budget to buy these shoes and went for different branded shoes that were cheaper. The problem was that they never really fit me right. I did not feel the support or stability that I was familiar with. Last year I was using a different brand shoe and sprained my ankle. This is when I told myself I now have the funds and i should go back to what I knew as tried and true. This shoe has brought back memories of high school and is a welcomed long overdue reunion.",

110241,5,11/14/2017,Still a great shoe The Adrenaline GTS has been a stellar shoe for years. I find it better than the Asics Gel Kayano since that shoe became quite narrow in the toe box. This is my most highly recommended shoe in my podiatry office.,

110241,5,11/12/2017,Wow. Fantastic and comfortable Amazing. I was formerly a Beast 16 runner and switched over to these for a lighter shoe with less bulk. Support is excellent they feel light on the feet and very comfortable. I'm extremely happy.  I run on the road and treadmill 15 to 20 miles per week.  I will say that I have the Rock and Roll marathon print version which due to the  cloth feel even lighter than the normal variety.,

110241,5,11/06/2017,Best shoe ,
110241,4,11/06/2017,Shoes. This pair feels a wider than previous pairs. Tightening the laces results in the toe material bunching up so I have them a little looser than I normally do.,

110241,5,11/06/2017,"Bought more than 6 times Walking and my ""clean casual"" shoes. I guess I need some sealed shoes too.  Socks get dirty on trails.",

110241,4,11/05/2017,Nice balance of cushion and support I had to get a size bigger (they didn't offer a half size up from 14) unlike other Brooks models I've owned. This is a nice shoe with a good balance between cushion and support. Definitely reduces impact and fatigue.,
110241,5,11/05/2017,Fits very well Every time I slip brooks on I want to run. That's what makes these shoes different from all the others,

They sent a new set of insoles, this made a huge difference but they did not feel as good as the 16's  usually wear a 12-12.5 any other shoes  but had to get in a 13 in these. Toes still hit on runs. Sent back and now trying the Ghost 9. Fingers crossed",
110241,5,11/02/2017,"Stable, light, well-cushioned shoe Years ago, because I weigh over 200 lbs., a local running store steered me into the Brooks Beast, and it was my favorite for all those years.  Tried the Adrenaline GTS 17 and have a new favorite.  Much lighter, just as cushioned if not more so, and my foot motion is much freer while still very stable.  Only note is that it seems a bit more snug all the way around than the same size Beast.",
110241,5,11/02/2017,Quality ,
110241,5,11/02/2017,"Improved and lighter than years gone by... Shoe Upper is made from different materials than earlier models (may be due to the sublimated design with guitars and banjos). First pair of 17's I've had (I've had multiples of all the years prior). First initial wear rubbed lateral toes on left foot, however since then, show has been great.",
110241,3,11/02/2017,Requires getting used to perhaps I have had several pairs of Brooks Cloud shoes over the years and these feel less cushy and a bit smaller in size after running in them 3-4 times. I hope I will get used to them soon.,

110241,5,11/01/2017,Miracle shoe to me I have Peripheral neuropathy and Plantar Fasciitis so even wearing shoes are painful. My podiatrist recommended I try Brooks. There are no words to describe what a difference these have made in my daily life. I could barely walk after getting out of bed in the morning without excruciating pain. With my Brooks I put them on first thing and 75% of my pain is gone. I have to say I don't believe I would be functional at all without them. It is truly unbelievable!,
110241,5,11/01/2017,Great Walking Shoe Use shoe for work. 5 hours walking daily. So comfortable and feet feel great. Will buy again! #reviewsweeps,

110241,5,10/31/2017,"I got in shape thanks to these shoes I don't usually write reviews, but I legitimately love these shoes. I used to weigh 250 lbs and when I started exercising I could run half a mile at most before I began having stitches from poor running shoes, I bought these shoes and fell in love and was instantly able to run twice as far before I had any similar pain caused by my shoes. I buy a pair a year and intend to keep buying them, my only complaint would be that there's not enough designs in the wider size, but that's the only complaint. #ReviewSweeps",

I heard from friends that they had a good experience at a running store so I went and tried a few different shoes.  In my brief store experience the GTS 17s seemed the most comfortable.  I ran 10k when I got home, which was a little longer than I had planned, and NO pain. I am about 120 miles into this pair and I couldn't be happier with them.",
110241,5,10/30/2017,"Great Product! I only use these as my everyday walking around shoes, but they are very comfortable and would work great for running also.",
110241,4,10/30/2017,Very Good Running Shoe Great shoe that does not have to much of a song feel during runs. Shoe is very supportive and responsive.,
110241,5,10/30/2017,"Good-bye Ravenna! After three versions of the Ravenna and while I loved the support, I felt I needed a little more cushion during my walks and runs. I decided to give the Adrenaline GTS 17 a try and I have not been disappointed! Styling is great and definitely upgrade in regards to cushioned run. Support was better than expected as well after being used to Ravenna excellent support design.",
110241,4,10/30/2017,"Nice comfortable shoe. My old knees don't let me run any more, but I still buy Adrenalines as my favorite gym and walking shoe. I just always buy the previous year's model to save some money. Might have a more limited color choice, but I can almost always find something. Good reliable shoes that fit my feet the way I expect.",

110241,5,10/30/2017,Great Shoe This is my 5th pair of  adrenaline's. They are comfortable and durable and I have had no injuries since running in these shoes. It is a fair price for a great shoe. I will continue to run in the Adrenaline GT.,

110241,4,10/29/2017,This time it ran a little small I run in these and Ravennas except for trail runs. This pair seems to run a little small and wide than my last pair of 17's.,
110241,5,10/29/2017,I would buy these shoes again! I wear these shoes for work and walking!I'm on my feet all day and they are very comfortable.,

110241,4,10/28/2017,"Good support and cushioned ride The support is good (comparable to the Ravenna) but be ready to buy at least a half size up. Where the Ravenna fit me true to size (14 D), the Adrenaline GTS 17 was too small in the toe box in both width and length (big toe hitting the very end) with a good width throughout the rest of the foot. I went a size up (15) and they fit pretty well. They are pretty good road shoes and offer a decent amount of cushion without feeling squishy.",
110241,5,10/28/2017,Best shoes ever! ,
110241,5,10/28/2017,I am a repeat buyer of this product #ReviewSweeps I have owned many versions of the Adreneline GTS from the 5 through the 17. They have been consistently comfortable and predictable in their reliability. I am a lighter runner (145 lbs) and get between 400 and 500 miles out of each pair before they need replacement. This latest version seemed to fit a bit more snugly than previous versions; the width feels fine but the length seems shorter. I am a repeat buyer and highly recommend the shoe,
110241,5,10/28/2017,Great shoes. ,
110241,5,10/28/2017,Perfect fit ,

Brooks were recommended by the local running store and I have been running in them ever since.  Almost a dozen pairs of Brooks later—from Ghosts to Adrenaline— I have found my shoe of choice!  I do, however, order them a half-size bigger for the perfect fit.  Love my Brooks obsession!  I always have a brand new back-up pair in the box ready to go!!",
110241,5,10/28/2017,"I've been in this shoe for years. As a woman, the toe box is perfect for me vs. the women's version. I've been in this shoe for years and I wear it with a Super Feet insert.",
110241,5,10/28/2017,Love the feel! ,
110241,5,10/28/2017,I would recommend this shoe After much research I bought the GTS16 to combat my Planter Fasciitis. The shoe lived up to its recommendation. So it didn't take much thought for me to move to the GTS17 when it was time to retire my GTS16.,
110241,5,10/28/2017,"Adrenaline GRS 17's have been very reliable. I have bought several 17's for my son over the past year. He had problems with the 16's...not durable, different fit from 15's. But he immediately loved the 17 version. He runs a LOT so we rotate new trainers every few months. Hoping the 18's are every bit as great.",
110241,5,10/28/2017,Great shoe for pronation This is me 3rd pair. Bought these for everyday support. Plus I can run whenever and have on the best shoe.,
110241,4,10/27/2017,Feels Great! I will be purchasing another pair! I run about 3 to 5 times a week. The show feels comfortable and the cushion is great. For the sale price I should've brought 2 pairs. I saw somewhere the shoes felt a half size to Big not to me. The shoes felt true to size. All around Great Shoe. GTS = Go To Shoe that fits the This Shoe.,

I have narrow and falling arch feet, I was using UA running shoes for everyday wear and my back started killing me as we were walking a lot with the kids on vacation.  I had enough and purchased these. I noticed an immediate difference in support and comfort!!! I started wearing store bought orthotics in other shoes to make them feel like these, my back doesn't hurt anymore after 3 weeks!!! I should have purchased something like these years ago!!  Now I need to find a flatter/neutral version for my high intensity T25 workout, running shoes are not good for that.  Give them a try they are extremely comfortable and probably the best running shoes I have had in my life!!",
110241,5,10/24/2017,This is my running shoe This is the most consistent shoe I've ever encountered. It is durable and always comfortable. There is a reason it is one of the most popular shoes on the market. I highly recommend it.,

I just wished Brooks made bright colored shoes with lots of reflectors for dark runs.",
110241,4,10/23/2017,"Great shoe but needs a new look I've been wearing Adrenalines for more than a decade and these new ones are just as good as earlier models. But isn't it time for Brooks to update their look? Plenty of other Brooks shoes have a more up-to-date styling, but the Adrenaline is trapped in the 90s.",
110241,5,10/23/2017,"Well worth it! Plantar faciatis suffer here. These shoes are perfect for the support and comfort needed. Every since using Brooks my plantar faciatis has gone away.  You have a customer for life. Excellent product, support, and value!",

110241,4,10/17/2017,"Another Great Adrenaline Shoe This is my 3rd version of the Adrenaline GTS. Year after year, the sizing and feel remains consistent. The shoe is comfortable for running and provides cushion without feeling heavy which is a huge benefit! I recommend this shoe often to friends who come to me with interest in taking up running. My only note in the GTS 17 version is that the inside heal of the shoe causes my foot to slide slightly, perhaps the insert has a slight mis-fit in the shoe. Nevertheless, the shoe remains comfortable enough to run for both training and casual races so I wouldn't shy away from the shoe! #ReviewSweeps",

I tried the mizuno wave runner as recommended by the tech at my local running store. I gave them a good 2 months and by the end I had knee and shin pain. I tried to see if I could switch them out but alas it was too late. I came back to my Adrenalines and am very happy I did. They provide much better support and feel good when I run. Not to mention how Brooks gives you 90 days to try them, you can't go wrong. My punishment for going astray is the cost of those wave runners, ugh. I've learned my lesson.",
110241,2,10/15/2017,"Not good for long, sweaty or wet runs This is my third pair of the GTS series.  In this version, I had the shoe broken in and went on a 20 mile run in very humid/sweaty conditions.  The insoles completely slid and folded back on themselves (causing bad rubbing on my arch).  Thinking it was a defect, I went to my local running store and got them exchanged.  New pair had same issue, only this time during my goal race.  Need to change insole design.  GTS-15's did not have this problem.",

110241,5,10/10/2017,"Minor changes; still comfortable! I primarily use my Brooks shoes for walking (~100K steps/week), striding, and weightlifting.  I have (3) pairs of Brooks Adrenaline series shoes from three different years, and they all have minor differences in design.  Interestingly, the oldest are 'normal' width, while the 15s and 17s are '2E' width, and all three pairs fit about the same.  The most noticeable difference to me is the change in lacing structure between the 15s and the 16s/17s; I have to lace the new shoes a little bit differently to achieve the same 'feel' as the older shoes, but the footbed is otherwise comfortable and familiar.  Great shoes!",
110241,5,10/10/2017,This is my 5th pair of GTS. Will definitely buy another ,
110241,4,10/10/2017,Great support shoe! Love the shoe.  The only con I have is that the stitching around the toes doesn't seem to hold up as well.  This was on my first pair.  I haven't gotten that many miles on these to where I would see that yet.,
110241,5,10/10/2017,Best shoe ever! This shoe has been nothing short of perfect for me. I am so glad that Brooks offers a narrow shoe. Ordering was easy and delivery was timely. Brooks running shoes have made my running more comfortable and I look forward to lacing them up every day.,

The only wear is on the bottoms. No sole separation, fabric tears or problems of any kind except normal wear on the bottom. My next pair should last longer, now I am 16 pounds overweight!!

110241,4,10/02/2017,"I would buy it for running but not for work shoes Im a mail man walking like 12miles to 15 a day 6 to 7 days aweek, its been almost 2 months since i bought mine and it looks like it was like a year old shoes when u see it now., best shoes i got but too expensive to buy every 3months",
110241,5,10/01/2017,I keep buying Brooks's because of the comfort! ,
110241,2,09/29/2017,Not the usual The color I wanted wasn't available anymore so I went with theses and I really don't like them. The fit is not right either. I won't by shoes online anymore. I only did this time because I have had many pairs of shoes from brooks,
110241,4,09/24/2017,A good running shoe ,
110241,5,09/24/2017,Love These Shoes I have had 3 orthopedic surgeries on my feet. I looked a Long time for a shoe that gives me the comfort and support I need. Finally the Adrenaline does that.,
110241,5,09/24/2017,"Definitely would buy these shoes again. I have problem feet and need Extra Wide shoes.  These shoes fit well, are very comfortable, and offers great support.  I just wish Brooks offered more styles/colors in Extra Wide.",
110241,1,09/23/2017,"Not for me... This shoe is comfortable to walk and run in, at the start, but after a few miles my knees started to ache. It is a light show, however, it is listed described as being a cushioned show, though it was not enough for me (I suffer from some miniscus issues in my right knee that requires me to run in a very cushioned shoe). I've gone back to the Transcend 4. It's an amazing shoe that has padded my knee issue and keeps me running!",
110241,5,09/18/2017,"Third time's a charm, but we won't stop here This is my third pair of the GTS line of Brooks shoes. This pair doesn't feel as well-ventilated as my two previous pairs, but the support and overall performance of the shoes is exactly what I expected and exactly what I need.",
110241,4,09/17/2017,"First runs great, more supportive than my old Glycerin G13 I am developing a bunion but that is unrelated to this shoe.  I will have to wait to see if this shoe is right for me long term.  But in short term, bunion issues aside, I like the shoe a lot and it feels more supportive and stable than my old Glycerin G13 pair.",
110241,5,09/17/2017,Love this product ,
110241,5,09/16/2017,I Love the shoes ,
110241,5,09/14/2017,"I will wear Brooks Adrenalines as long as they are made Always, always, remember to buy Brooks shoes one size up from your normal shoe.  It used to be 1/2 size, but something has changed and now it is a full size.  And one would think things like a shoe size would be standard...",
110241,5,09/12/2017,No more knee pain I have flat feet and had to ice my knee after every run.  Since running with the  Adrenaline  GTS   17 with the Currexsole runpro (low profile) insoles  my knees are fine.,
110241,3,09/12/2017,Yes Are use this product for jogging. The reason why I would recommend these sneakers because of the price.  It's difficult for me to find 2E.,
110241,3,09/11/2017,Didn't work for me ,
110241,4,09/10/2017,Best Adrenaline in a while Comfortable build and super stable platform. One panel heel provides stability and comfort. Cushion is just right and not too soft.,
110241,4,09/07/2017,Shoes are wonderful.  They run a little small. I would buy one half size larger than your normal size.  Either that or my feet are starting to grow at this late stage in life.,
110241,5,09/03/2017,Best Stability Shoe! I run 4-5 milers on trails and some paved paths and after 40 miles I love how the shoe keeps me stable and biomechanically correct. At 10.8 ounces it has good response and comfort. Not clunky and not overly soft. Great shoe from Brooks.,
110241,5,09/01/2017,Been using these for daily activity since v 12 I walk 10K+ steps per day.  Love the black because I can wear them with dockers and work and they don't really look like running shoes.  I walk and work (reading email and such) about an hour per day.,
110241,5,09/01/2017,"Been buying the Adrenaline GTS series since 12! I have a pair I use for nothing but running and a pair I use for my daily activity.  Oh, and 3-4 pair with 400+ miles on them for use in the yard.",
110241,1,08/30/2017,maybe if perhaps larger size or wider toe box ,
110241,5,08/29/2017,"I've been buying these shoes for the past 7 years! Seven years ago I went into a running store to get fitted for a running shoe.  I walked out with a pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS.  They are my ""go-to"" shoe, so when one pair wears out, its back to the store to buy another pair.  Year after year, they make gradual improvements to the shoe, but never sway from the most dependable shoe that I have ever worn.  That is why, even though I have gotten a free pair of shoes now and then, I but these.",
110241,5,08/28/2017,"Brooks are the best.  I will buy them again, and again...... I used to run with Asics until.... I bought a pair of Brooks!   Go ahead,get a pair, your feet will thank you! Every pair of Brooks I have owned have far outlasted ANY other running shoes in the past. Glad to see some more color options coming our way.",
110241,5,08/26/2017,Second pair like this I work on a concrete floor all night long and these shoes help my back and legs and feet feel a whole lot better.,
110241,5,08/26/2017,Love them! Ordered half size bigger - excellent fit an feel ,
110241,5,08/20/2017,Awesome! I used to run in ASICS. Excellent shoes but I've found the Brooks to be lighter and last far longer before needing replaced. Since I'm a chubby runner the Brooks are a no-brainer.,
110241,5,08/19/2017,Maximum comfort ,
110241,5,08/18/2017,Yes I would buy these again They run a little bigger than my old Nike Air finger-traps but are pretty comfortable. I wish they didn't have a tongue and fit a little snugger around the ankle but overall pretty comfortable.,
110241,5,08/16/2017,This is a great shoe for distance running. This is a great shoe for those runners training for a marathon as the shoe does well with 30-40 miles per week.,
110241,4,08/15/2017,"Great blend of stability and cushion. I run high mileage, road and trail. Uppers hold up well. Maybe a little work of sole in rear foot area to improve wear. Actually trained on trails in Alps this summer in the Adrenaline.",
110241,3,08/10/2017,"Shoe Finder Recommendation I have high arches and run in the Ghost 9 and 10.  I used Brooks Shoe Finder and it recommended the Adrenaline GTS as I have had knee and leg injuries in the past.  Without choosing the injury, it does recommend the Ghost 10.  The Adrenaline is a 1/2 size to small and also gave me a blister on my big toe.I'm assuming it didn't work out for me as the Adrenaline is a Stability shoe vs the Ghost neutral shoe.",
110241,5,08/07/2017,I would buy again. ,
110241,3,08/04/2017,Okay ,
110241,5,08/01/2017,"1st ""real"" running shoe It is my first year running xc and these are the shoes my local shoe specialist recommended. I have close to 70miles on them and they feel great. Honestly, these shoes are worth every penny to me!",
110241,5,07/30/2017,Very good and comfortable shoe I use these shoes for running and working out. Very durable and worth the money.,
110241,2,07/29/2017,"I would not buy this again. They're comfortable, light, breathable, and VERY supportive for a running shoe. MY only complaint is the durability. I've had them almost a month, and the outsole is coming separated and unglued. The mesh is fraying near the toe. I have not been rough on these shoes at all, but they're falling apart on me. I might be able to get another month before I have to toss them.",
110241,5,07/28/2017,I will be buying another pair ,
110241,4,07/27/2017,"Can't find an alternative to those ... Those are not perfect shoes. They are not responsive, not really light and the 12 mm offset (and according to some websites it's almost 13mm) is far from what I'd want in my shoes. But .... I simply cannot find any real alternative to these shoes. No other company that I know of makes real stability shoes available in 2E width, with such a roomy toe-box. So, I simply buy those and will continue to till there will be some alternative.In comparison with 16 model these are a bit wider, and have better quality upper (a bit more ventilated too) and have a very similar ride - stiff and very stable.Personally I wish they would be a bit more bouncy, like the old 14 were.",
110241,5,07/26/2017,Love Brooks shoes! ,
110241,5,07/24/2017,"Will buy again and again This is already my second pair of the GTS 17's. I mainly use them for walking and just recently light jogging. There is plenty of support and cushion for how I've been using them. They aren't in a wide, which I usually get, but I find there is ample room in the toe box and my foot doesn't feel constricted. These shoes have held up very well, on and off pavement. Off pavement (gravel) I did tend to feel the rocks a bit more than a trail shoe, but that was to be expected. Very impressed with the support these shoes give and how well they have held up.",
110241,5,07/22/2017,Best running shoes ever ,
110241,5,07/20/2017,"My Go To Shoe! At work or when I run, these are the shoes for me. I love the fact there's been very little change in the design the last few years.  This is my 17th pair and I will continue to buy them as long as they are available.",
110241,4,07/20/2017,i would buy this again ,
110241,4,07/16/2017,"sleek design - just needs improved grip for the outsole Great aesthetics. Only qualm is the grip of the outsole, specifically in wet weather conditions. Slightly less grip than a NB pair of shoes, but aesthetically more pleasing.",
110241,5,07/15/2017,Extremely comfortable shoe I don't run but walk 3 to 4 miles a day.This is the best shoe I have ever owned..I knew it the moment I tried them on..,
110241,2,07/15/2017,"Not digging the shoe :( I have very finicky feet and have tried every, and I mean EVERY support running shoe on the market and have always come back to the Adrenaline's as my feet love them, until the 17s came out.   Not quite sure what exactly Brooks change from the 16s to the 17s but seems like they completely reinvented the wheel. These shoes give me blisters and hurt my arches so I've had to resort to wearing my old 16's which are falling apart.   I would buy some new 16s but can't find them anywhere.   When will the 18s be out? And would you please go back to the Andrenaline16 engineering in the heel and arch support, and just make some aesthetic changes, if you could.",
110241,5,07/11/2017,Best Running Shoe I have Ever Owned I suffer from shin splints and have tried other support shoes from competitors. Nothing compares to this shoe.,
110241,5,07/11/2017,"Great shoe! So light, it's almost like it's not there. Tongue is a tad wider than the Beast, which I like.",
110241,4,07/06/2017,"Same great shoe...only snugger. I've been wearing the Adrenaline GTS series for at least 4 years. I use this running shoe for its versatility. I'm not a runner, but the great cushioning helps my knees and hips when I walk, work or occasionally shoot hoops (not play basketball; just shoot hoops). The only drawback to the 2017 model is it seems a little snugger (in length) than previous versions, but not enough to return for a larger size. Unless my feet grew, which doesn't seem to be the case as my other footwear fit fine.",
110241,5,07/06/2017,Happy overall This shoe is really comfortable with a great deal of support.  The support is there without being overly corrective. Nice shoe.  The only thing I would change is the interior height of the shoe. I could use a little more room in the middle of the shoe.  I struggle with  toe pain and arch pain.  Brooks is the only shoe that works for me.,
110241,4,07/06/2017,"First time buying a REAL running shoe I've always enjoyed running but never invested in an actual running shoe until now, it has held up well to running upwards of 40 miles a week and has been perfect for training for my first marathon. Fairly light while giving plenty of support. Looks good, feels fast.",
110241,5,07/04/2017,"Unbelievablely comfortable! I took these on vacation with me because I knew I would be walking at least 5-10 miles a day on rough cobblestone roads.  They worked out better than I anticipated!  These are an excellent pair of shoes,",
110241,4,07/04/2017,Brooks is my go to shoe but another model The fit and look of this shoe is second to none however I will need to try another model the GTS apparently has too much support in the arch for me.  I have extremely flat feet and the support digs in painfully to the area I where my arch should be.,
110241,2,07/04/2017,I am getting frustrated it's not the same shoe since the 12 I have bee wearing brooks several years and with every pair I grow more frustrated with the inconsistency of fit and durability.,
110241,5,07/02/2017,"Best Running Shoes I have ever bought These shoes are super comfortable and stable.  I bought them using Brook' questionnaire to find the right shoes, and it was right on.  I had a pair of GTS 16s, which never felt right.  These GTS 17s are perfect for me.  I was looking for a pair of shoes that would allow me to walk throughout Disney World for 5 days, and these shoes will make my feet happy.",
110241,4,06/29/2017,Solid shoe Jogging 9-11 K / week. Previous shoes wore through toe too quickly. The material of this pair appears tougher.Very comfortable right out of box.Good tread and cushion.,
110241,2,06/28/2017,"Poor craftsmanship with right shoe I have a poorly fit right shoe that pinches the toes, I dont have an issue with the left shoe. This is the first pair of Brooks shoes that I have had an issue with.  Love my Transcend 3's, and loved the Brooks Beast.",
110241,5,06/28/2017,Great running shoes. I had a pair of Brooks 14s that lasted a very long time.  Brooks running shoes are one of the best out there. These shoes feel very comfortable and are great for long distance running. It absorbs the shock when you run. I highly recommend to check out this pair if you need a strong running shoe.,
110241,5,06/27/2017,Good fit and construction Overweight 70 something overpronation guy. Can't run but walk for health. Had bad problems with right foot for a year. Big pain and collapsed arch. This shoe accepted my orthotics well and pain is 90 % gone. It's excellent for both support and  cushion. Time will tell about lasting but my other brooks were very impressive. Will update after time passes.,
110241,2,06/22/2017,I enjoy the shoe I am a diabetic so it can be a challenge to select the best shoe.  This shoe was more resistance than anticipated and I didn't feel the insole had enough support.  The shoe is a great buy and I will be looking at others to buy,
110241,4,06/19/2017,"Comfortable for me With my feet issues, these are quite comfortable. I try to alternate on a three day rotation with other brooks shoes. I would buy this one again!",
110241,5,06/18/2017,"Sole Searching There are those that say, ""You never really know someone until you run a mile in their shoes."" However, what if you've never run a mile? Luckily with Brooks, running a mile is easier than ever. The cloud like cushion, the steel like support, and the workhorse durability mean that I can run a mile in MY OWN shoes, on my own path, and discover who I really am.",
110241,5,06/18/2017,Yes.  I would buy this product again.  I already have two pa ,
110241,5,06/16/2017,i would buy again ,
110241,1,06/15/2017,"Not the shoe for me The shoes are lightweight and seem durable. However, they are not comfortable to me. I have a knee that bothers me and these shoes seem to aggravate it even more when I run.",
110241,5,06/13/2017,"Excelent product, best running shoes I have ever used. ",
110241,3,06/13/2017,"Wears too quickly I used the shoes for walking everyday and for my workouts. This was suggested by my running store so that I might pronate less. I got my first pair and the tread started to wear and the shoe started to fall apart after 3 weeks. Then, I got a replacement pair, thinking ""maybe it was a bad shipment"". But lo and behold three weeks later, the shoes are starting to fall apart and the tread is starting to go.",
110241,1,06/13/2017,Mislead Read the reviews. All were very positive that these offered great support. So I spent the big money and had to buy new ortho insoles cause they weren't as great as the reviews led me to believe. They are a a looking shoe but I was counting on excellent support for over pronation and planter facitious.,
110241,4,06/12/2017,"Wearing GTS since 2008 Many of the color combinations were sold out, which is strange since you are the manufacturer.",
110241,5,06/11/2017,"Most comfortable sneaker ever. My caveat: I am not a runner. I usually buy New Balance and liked them and most recently Nike. I have no big complaints with those brands. But these Brooks GTS 17 Adrenaline are the most comfortable athletic shoe I have worn in years. The fit well, are light and feel like nothing when I'm in them. It makes me want to run, and I don't like running. I'm a wide and they are hard to find. I give them my highest recommendation.",
110241,4,06/01/2017,Comfortable shoe Need more support.  But it is a good shoe.  Much better than the ones I usually use.,
110241,5,05/30/2017,Would buy again! ,
110241,5,05/30/2017,"Great fit, great performance I injured my foot just before my new Adrenaline's were delivered and have only run about 20 miles so far but I can say they carry on the tradition of being a great shoe for me. I have a narrow foot (B width) and can sometimes wear a regular size but much prefer to have the correct size. Brooks is one of a very few companies to give that option and I really appreciate it. My last pair of 16's were D width and I can tell a big difference. It's interesting to note that if you compare the inserts from the two models they are exactly the same size but the difference in width comes from the body of the shoe with the ""D"" having more room inside. So far the 17's seem a little bit lighter and a little more cushioned but I will need more time to see how they feel after my foot completely heals and they break in all the way. Keep up the good work Brooks!",
110241,5,05/28/2017,"UMMMMMMMMMM YES First time wearing Brooks, was referred and will probably continue on with Brooks...forever.",
110241,4,05/28/2017,"Solid running shoe for wide feet. Great shoe, only have around 50 miles on them so far. I went with a wide fit and it felt a little narrow in the toe box (big toe) at first. However, after running in them for a few days I have had no problems with blisters, hot spots, or foot pain.Happy with the design and styling. I like how the laces attach to the tongue of the shoe. They are nice looking shoes with a good color selection.",
110241,5,05/27/2017,Absolutely the most comfortable pair of shoes in my closet! ,
110241,5,05/26/2017,Will buy again! I used to buy only Brooks but for some reason moved away from them.  This pair has sold me on them again and will definitely buy them again!,
110241,5,05/23/2017,Good Shoes I use them as my every day shoes. They are comfortable and good for my knees.,
110241,3,05/22/2017,Tread Wears Out Very Quickly These shoes are comfortable but the tread/soles wore out quickly in the two pairs I have owned. Both lasted less that 250 miles before I wore thru the rubber on the heels and started to hit the foam. Never had that happen with a shoe before. Kind of disappointed because I do like the shoes - but to wear out that quickly isn't really acceptable and gets expensive fast.,
110241,4,05/22/2017,Would  purchase again. ,
110241,5,05/20/2017,Best version yet! I have been wearing Brooks for several years and have tried several models. Always returning to adrenaline and this is my favorite sso far. Put them in and they were instantly comfortable like a slipper. feel good as a walker and a runner. getting another pair soon before they get changed again!! great shoe,
110241,4,05/20/2017,"Comfortable running shoe for flat/floppy feet Had bought New Balance 990 series running shoes for my last several pairs but decided to switch up to Brooks on recommendation from a friend. I just started running in these after not having run for about 10 months. They're comfortable and fit well. My main complaint is that they don't lock into my heel quite as well as the 990s did -- I use non-medical orthotic inserts due to foot problems and with those in there, my heel doesn't fit well and slips a bit when I'm running. Hopefully no blisters in my future.Also, I will note that it was hard to set these up with the last eyelet laced for the heel-lock without making these way too snug (like circulation-loss snug). Eventually figured it out, but that's another con in comparison to my old 990s.",
110241,5,05/19/2017,I love this shoe! I use it on my mid to long runs. It has been working out perfectly. They feel great and comfortable for my feet. I have been getting the Adrenaline GTS version for 2 years now. Definitely my go to shoe for my marathons!,
110241,5,05/18/2017,This is great ,
110241,4,05/18/2017,"Repeat buyer they are cushier this year but wear out faster I run marathons even though I'm a bigger guy.   I like  Adrenalines and have been running in them for a few years now.   They always fit well, are roomy and have a nice toe box.   I like shoes a little loose.    This version #17 wears out quicker, I mean the bottom black part comes off to reveal the white underneath.   I still run 'em into the ground before buying more.    I'm on my second pair this year and at 700 miles YTD so far so not too bad.   I bought another 3rd pair that I haven't worn yet.    I keep getting ""just one more run"" from the 2nd pair before I toss them.    I am pain free and injury free for years and typically run 2000 miles per year.",
110241,4,05/17/2017,Solid choice ,
110241,5,05/15/2017,GTS 17 ,
110241,5,05/14/2017,"Great shoe. Even better then the GTS 16 I use them in the gym. I use them for walking on the trail. I use them when I'm fishing.Very comfortable on the boat when you're on your feet 8 hrs. a day. They are great when I'm walking around the pond. These are better then the GTS 16's, and I thought those were an outstanding shoe. All in all, very happy.",
110241,5,05/12/2017,My Favorite Shoes I tried out the Adrenaline GTS 15 after my podiatrist told me that I should be using a shoe with mild pronation control. I really liked them for both pronation control and as a support shoe. I got this year's version back in November and it was all I ran in for months. I'm over 400 miles on them and about to purchase my second pair of these shoes. I've since added some orthotics per suggestion of my podiatrist.,
110241,4,05/10/2017,not sure yet. I teach kickboxing and need a great sneaker this one fits the bill. I have over 70 people in the class at one time and they always ask me what is the best sneaker for it.,
110241,4,05/05/2017,"I would buy this again, to have multiple custom colors. ",
110241,5,05/03/2017,Wide woman's foot with an orthodic.  Great Shoe! I have a wide foot and use an orthodic.  The men's wide is perfect. Except I wish the colors were better.  I love the adrenaline.,
110241,5,05/01/2017,"These are Very nice Comfortable shoes These are the first pair of Brooks I have ever owned , I was so pleased to find them in wide width and nice color....very Comfortable and cushion on my feet as I am a heavy guy and need the support for standing and walking a lot.",
110241,5,05/01/2017,"Excellent all around running show Three weeks into these shoes, and I am very satisfied with their performance.  I run on a mix of pavement and gravel roads, and in particular was looking for a lightweight, impact cushioning, all-around running shoe, which these are.",
110241,4,04/29/2017,great shoes I run on a treadmill and work 12 hours shifts in a hospital. My feet feel great after.,
110241,4,04/26/2017,Love this shoe! I love this shoe. It is probably the best shoe I've ever worn as a mid distance runner. The only downside is if you over pronate; like myself. If you over pronate the shoe starts to wear out on the edges and I've had mine since August and a piece of my shoe is tearing slightly every day. Other than this it is a great shoe and I recommend it to all mid distance athletes,
110241,5,04/24/2017,very comfortable I love Brooks shoes and their customer service. Recommend them to the reluctant runner--you don't have to be a super star to benefit from Brooks.,
110241,5,04/24/2017,Nike sucks ,
110241,5,04/22/2017,SUPER SHOE! This is a great shoe for doing a lot of standing or for doing walks or hikes.  It feels supportive but not restrictive.  I love the cushioning feel to the shoe as well.  It's a great shoe and I wish you offered more colors in the wide sizes.  LOVE THE SHOE!,
110241,5,04/21/2017,Couldn't be better ,
110241,1,04/19/2017,Can't go the distance on a marathon Broke these in perfectly for 65 miles prior to a marathon.  Previous training runs were with Kayano's with upwards of 350 miles on them and no issues on 20 mile training runs.  But my GTS 17's started giving out at about mile ten of my marathon.  Legs were totally dead by mile 13.,
110241,5,04/19/2017,"Better than Asics Kayano Love these shoes.  I've been running with Asics Kayano for a couple of years.  Lately, I've been squeezing in 5 miles per day.  Normally, at the 3 mile mark, I start to feel some discomfort.  When I switched to the GTS 17, once the shoe is broken in, I no longer feel the discomfort, not at 3 or 5 mile mark.  Net/net, cheaper and better.",

I work in a pain, spine, orotho clinic and recommend Brooks shoes to my patients - with an approximate 70+% positive feedback from those patients that make the switch. On a personal note - I switched to Brooks (and Superfeet insoles) in 2012, and have experienced a 90+% reduction in plantar fasciitis flare-ups and a significant reduction in low back pain. I'm neither paid nor endorsed by Brooks - simply sharing my experience in hopes that others can gain.",
110241,5,04/17/2017,This years model is really good I run about 10 to 15 miles a week and this shoe is great for that amount of running.,

110241,5,04/15/2017,Great shoes that do what they need to. I have been wearing Adrenalines for 4 years now. They are quality shoes that are comfortable to wear.  My only complaint is that they tend to run a little small in length. I'm a size 13 and did not want to size up but they do fit. I would recommend sizing 1/2 size up.,
110241,4,04/15/2017,"Second pair of GTS 17 I am currently training for my first marathon in June and currently use the Ascics GTS 2000-4, Nike Zoom Structure 20 and the GTS 17. The ASCICS is a really good shoe for support & Cushion but it has too much cushion and is not that responsive. The Nike is very responsive, provides the least cushion which makes my foot very sore during the long runs.The GTS 17 on the other hand has the perfect support, cushion and i feel very comfortable while running. It is very responsive too, i am so glad i am using it, a year or so ago, i tried wearing it but i felt very weird in the arch area and i thought it was not for me.Also, the GTS 17 has the softest footfalls compared to the ASCICS and the Nike. For some reason, i have observed that runners who wear dynamic support shoes have the loudest footfalls.",
110241,1,04/14/2017,"I'm in the process of returning these shoes I'm an NCAA ref, FIBA International and USA Basketball refereee. I switched to Brooks from asics and was so grateful I found the Brooks's Adrenaline. I usually order or buy from a store 3 or 4 pairs at a time for training and for my on court officiating shoe (all black for these ones). Everyone always asks me what I use on the court and I swear by these because other ref shoes can be uncomfortable. This time I ordered 3 pairs from Brooks online. I wore one of them to work during the day and they hurt me so bad. When I tried them on initially then felt fine. I have been studying so hard for an exam and just passed so now I can send back the shoes this weekend. I was going to call Brooks to see if someone could help me online so I know if this model was made smaller or different this year.",
110241,5,04/11/2017,The shoes wear great!!  Very pleased with the comfort. Haven't worn them long enough to find anything bad about them.  Don't expect to.  They were very comfortable right out of the box.,
110241,5,04/10/2017,I will be recommending brooks to all my friends! I bought these shoes to help me during military p.t. The first day I used them I immediately noticed the aches in my knees and ankles were gone. These shoes are a purchase I have no problem making again.,

First 5 mile run had a lot of discomfort in my hip. After a few more runs seemed better, but after a couple more weeks starting getting a lot of pain in one of my lower legs. So much so I finally went to the Dr. thinking I was maybe putting to many miles on my body (100-150) per month. After 3 weeks of rest came back only to have the same problem persist. Finally decided to make the change and try the Transcend 4's!! A blessing in disguise. Pain went away within a couple of days and back on track now..

I've been hunting for several years to find a replacement 4E wide, after another brand took a nosedive in design and build - and after otherwise continuing to try several other brands.  Thank God for Brooks and this GTS 17.  This shoe is extremely comfortable, light (but not too light), with a generous toe box (so my toes have room to naturally splay, instead of being crammed, scrunched and pinched - imagine that?!)!  Well done!!  Quick NOTE:  This shoe runs a 1/2 size small - order 1/2 size up and you should be good.",

I was very pleased to find the mens' Adrenaline a number of years ago because the men's show fits me in a normal ""D"" width.  This is the first version of mens' Adrenaline that has rubbed the outside (bunion) area of my forefoot.  The 15s and 16s were fine.  Something is wrong with either the stitching or material in that area.  Very annoying and I will not buy another pair of 17s.  The women's shoe, which I also purchased in a wide width, was fine.  The shoe is stiff, clunky and heavy feeling.  Hope the next version is closer to previous versions.",

The GTS 17 is the best running shoe I have ever owned. I wear size 10.5 in normal width. This shoe fits my foot perfectly and is really comfortable. I prefer a snug fit in my running shoes and this shoe hugs my foot. They feel extremely lightweight compared to my GTS 16 shoes. I absolutely love the Nightlife / Black / True Red color scheme! In winter, a lot of my runs are after dark. I believe these shoes make me more visible to motorists. I am begging Brooks to consider making a Nightlife color option a standard for the Adrenaline GTS. I think this color will be a big seller! Thank you, Brooks for making quality products and providing great customer support!",
110241,1,11/30/2016,"Another Adrenaline disappointment - 3rd in a row I'm not a runner, but I usually buy running shoes becuase they're light, flexible, and comfortable. Comfort is the problem, though, not just with Brooks but with most makers who insist on setting sewn-in straps or seams right over the inner- and outer-most knuckles. Also, I need an extra-wide shoe, and most shoe companies don't make them.I bought Adrenaline GTS for three years running -- GTS 12, 13, and 14 -- without a hitch. I loved those shoes and never had a problem with any of them. But the GTS 15 and 16 hurt shortly after I started wearing them due to the above-noted knuckle problem.I had hoped for better with the GTS 17, but it's no better. The 17 runs short (about 1/4"" shorter than the 14) but moving up a half-size didn't help. Within five minutes I could tell they would hurt just as the 15 and 16 did.This is very disappointing. I had the good fortune to come across a pair of new-old-stock GTS 14 in my size a short while ago, but they will wear out, and when they do, I'll be back on the hunt for comfortable shoes.P.S. I tried a pair of Brooks Beast a few months ago, and they were too narrow. They were the same size as my Adrenalines (11.5 4E) but they felt more like 2E.",
110241,1,11/19/2016,"Suprisingly Dissapointing I want to first start off by saying that I love Brooks the company and the people that work for it.  The online support, friendliness, and professionalism of everyone I have every dealt with has been extraordinary.  For the most part their shoes have been unbelievably well designed and produced.  I can also say that I have been running in the Adrenaline since it was originally introduced so I am very familiar with the transitions its gone through over time.  I am a long distance Triathlete and have been using this shoe as my training shoe for as long as I can remember.  On and off road it has been the only shoe comfortable enough to log big miles in. I have had plantar issues for years now and since this is a 12mm drop shoe it makes it very easy to manage.  Brooks is one of the last companies around to produce a top notch 12mm drop shoe.    Unfortunately this shoe has completely missed the mark for me personally.  The changes that this shoe has undergone for this new model will leave you very dissapointed if you are looking for the same feel that your Adrenaline 14, 15, or 16 gave you.  First off the shoes no longer runs true to the normal Brooks sizing.  I wear a 10.5 and this shoe runs bigger than previous 10.5s have. Not by a little either.  The toe box is ridiculously big. If you have run in any previous versions of this shoe you will immediately notice that the front half of your foot is absolutely swimming around in the front end of the shoe.  I use their ""Normal D"" width and it feels like an extra wide end.  You will feel like your running in a flipper. The very front of the shoe now has plastic wrapped around the front instead of mostly mesh.  Where this plastic meets more plastic (see second eye hole from the bottom) an excessive amount of glue was used.  This area will rub your small toe or outside of your foot to pieces.  It is incredibly annoying. Somehow this shoe has lost any heel to toe transition it once had.  I'm not a shoe expert and cant really speak as to whats going on there but it feels like your running with the brakes on a bit compared to previous versions of this shoe.I want to again re-iterate that these are just my opinions strictly based what I expected these shoes to be based on what they have been.  They could end up being absolutely fantastic for you!  They just feel very cheap and short cutted to me. I feel like this is the first time since 2009 that I may want to start trying other brands top of the line flagship shoes.Happy Running and be safe!",
110241,2,11/14/2016,"Insole caused a lot of discomfort. First off, I have worn many pairs of the Adrenaline GTS 14, the 15 and the 16.  I've been with Brooks Adrenaline since late 2013.  The 17's are the first pair I have worn that have not been comfortable.  Reading all these good reviews, it is obvious to me we all have different feet.  I have flat feet so I don't have that natural arch in my foot.  Maybe that's the problem.  All I know is Brooks must have made some modifications to the inner sole (instep) because when I ran the other day I was in serious discomfort.  After my run it felt like I had lost some skin from my foot.  I'm going back to the 16's while they are in stock and then I may need to move to another brand until the 18's come out and hopefully they will not be as uncomfortable.  Stop messing with a good thing Brooks.",
110241,5,11/08/2016,"Like Beast 16s & GTS 17 : GTS is Super Light I recently discovered Brooks Brand of Atheletic running shoes.Brooks is a great company with integrity, are consumer conscious and will go out of their way to ensure customer satisfaction. ( check out their website, if you haven't already done so )Nike once ruled that domain exclusively but that's since changed now that I've discovered the Brooks Beast 14s, 16s & Adrenaline GTS 17s which are perfect for me.Once I find an atheletic shoe that fits me perfectly and are stable and comfortable, I get several pairs and save them for future use just in case the manufacture changes style, quality, fit or comfort.I typically wear a size 12 D ( normal width ) in all my shoes ( atheletic, dress, sandals, flipflops, hiking boots, etc... ); however, Brooks' shoes tend to be smaller so I've had to get half to full size larger.I guess I got lucky in that Beast 16s & GTS 17s just came out right when I stumbled across Brooks brand.I have purchase following Brooks shoes in last two months:1x Adrenaline size 13 D Blue1x Adrenaline size 13 D Black2x Beast 16 size 13 D Black2x Beast 16 size 13 D Blue1x Beast 16 size 13 D Suede1x Beast 14 size 12.5 D Gold1x Beast 14 size 12.5 D BlackI plan to get two more "" Black "" GTS 17s during Black Friday as there should be some deep discounts...That should keep me until late 2017 or early 2018.GTS 17sAre super light compared to Beast 14s &16s.Have become my everyday shoe because they are very light, very comfortable, have good arch support & motion control and the black GTS 17s are all black and they look great with most of my attire whether its casual slacks, dockers, mesh pants or Under Armour compression leggings...Beast 16s are insanely more comfortable because of the additional motion control, cushioning and support but are heavier...I simply "" love "" how light the GTS 17s are.I'm also very pleased, even ecstatic that the GTS 17s come in all black which is rare for a running shoe that works for me.Beast 16s are good for any distances, extremely long or short...GTS 17s are good for shorter distances...Best of success in whatever you decide to get...",
110241,4,11/04/2016,"Half a size  too big Adrenaline 16 are the first running shoes I have ever purchased and was very happy with them. I just recently returned them because the stitching in the front was coming loose.  I decided to grab the latest model, the 17.  They seemed much lighter and have more flexibility (without breaking them in) compared to the 16.   Although, I was very impressed with the 17 the fitment was not the perfect fit for my feet. they are half a size too long and too wide (I purchased the same size as my 16).  Since the 16 fit me like a glove and had more support around the side of my feet I finally decided to just return the 17 and go back with the 16.  I may just stock up and buy a few pairs of the 16 and never have to worry about buying shoes for a few years.  If you have wide feet, Im confident you will be happy with the 17.",
110241,5,11/03/2016,I would buy this product again. The adrenaline line of shoes is the best shoe I've ever bought. I won't buy any other brand!,

110242,5,12/02/2017,Fits like a glove. So comfortable and light. ,
110242,4,11/29/2017,"Almost perfect! Pros: Real ""D"" size fit, unlike other shoes that are way too narrow.  Great cushioning! In the store they felt like they would be too cushy, but on the trail they are just right.  Rock plate is not necessary with the amount of shock absorption.  Heel to toe roll is good compared to other trail shoes.  Traction is good is all directions. Great arch support.     Cons: My only negative is that the heel cup area is a bit too loose.  Slight heel slip up and down.  Also, the shoe may side slip in the heel area on a off camber/off center rock hit in the heel area.  For this reason, I don't use these shoes on very rocky terrain.  Great shoe in all other landscapes.",
110242,5,11/17/2017,"This is my 5th pair These shoes are fantastic for dry weather trail running. They are a great transition shoe so if you run on some road or gravel to get to the trails, they perform very well. I use these mainly on dry, rocky technical trails and they do very well even without a rock plate. Although they will suffice for sloppy, muddy, wet trail conditions, a more aggressive outsole would be awesome (I'm thinking Hoka Speedgoat 2). The upper has been very durable. I have seen the outsole and midsole wear out before the uppar on my previous 3 pairs. This is my 5th pair of Caldera's so you can say that I am one happy customer. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the rain has come to my part of the world (Chico, CA) and due to the outsole I can no longer jam down hairpin switchbacks at full speed feeling absolutely confident in the traction. I will buy more of this shoe.",
110242,3,11/07/2017,"switching to the women's model fixes instability Many men who otherwise like this shoe have complained of instability on technical descents.  I think that's because this shoe has a very wide forefoot, which reduces control.  Even though my foot is on the wide side, I experienced the same thing.  My tip, for those having this issue, is to see if you can find a women's model in the same length.  I switched from a men's 7 to a women's 8.5 (same length, but narrower), and the instability went away.  Normally I can't wear women's models because they're too wide, but these are so wide the women's actually works for me (size-wise).Having said all that, the shoe didn't work for me for other reasons: (1) The drop feels like it's more than the listed 4 mm.  As a result, on descents, I felt like I was too much up on my toes (I prefer a zero drop, but have been OK with the drop on other shoes listed as 4 mm, e.g., the Nike Terra Kiger).  (2) I'm a mid-to-forefoot striker, and land towards the front of the shoe.  Given this, I find there's too much taper in the front of the Caldera.  As a consequence, I'm landing on a too-thin section of the midsole, leaving me with insufficient protection from rocks and shock.",
110242,5,11/04/2017,"Just Right Just received my Caldera and did my usual 4.5 mile 1,800 ft. Loop. Normally running in Ghosts so glad the last feels much the same as the Ghost and the Adrenaline for that matter, but with a more supportive arch and just enough added cushioning so I'm not feeling every sharp stone on the trail. I tried the Cascadia but fit was always a problem, mainly the narrow toe box. The Caldera are great so far and suits my needs for a trail runner perfectly. The toe box matches my foot really well. A new version is being released soon so hope they don't change the last on this one.",

Brooks are the only shoes that take away that beating, and they last for at least 6 months.

110242,5,10/04/2017,Love this shoe! I have flat feet and a reconstructed foot post calcaneal osteotomy and double tendon transfer(6 years ago).  My foot splays flat and most shoes are narrower which gives me blisters.  I was using Altra shoes but this Caldera fits like a glove and has stability with a wider toe box readily accommodating my orthotics.  I can run for hours in this shoe without having to think about them being on my feet. Well done Brooks.,
110242,4,09/22/2017,"This is a really good shoe. First of all I really like this shoe.  Brooks opened up their new section of trail runner with the Caldera.  It is not a clunky Cascadia, nor is it the newly ruined minimal PureGrit. It is a mid-height stack lower rise longer distance everyday run shoe. I waited FOREVER for it to be released. I actually kinda of love it. I have nearly 300 miles in it. I am over 6' and weigh in nearly 220 lbs. I always find the first 100 yards of a run to have a slightly unstable feeling. Then the shoe ""settles in"" and is nearly bombproof for the rest of the run. I initially thought maybe the shoe was just breaking in but every single run is the same. I've had some very minor issues with some of the overlays delaminating mainly the logo on the lace garage. I noticed initially that the tread lugs wore very quickly but it seems to have completely stopped with plenty of tread left now? I have ran in these from the rocky trails of Western North Carolina to the moon dust and lava rock of Central Oregon and can count the times on one hand where traction was questionable. And those times were either sand on smooth rock or off camber wet roots.  It ascends with poise and descends like a beast. It is by no means a technical rock hopper but it just stays so comfy for the longer miles.The only things I would change would be to add a forefoot rock plate and probably add a bit more tread lug depth for wet conditions. First of all, get a proper running shoe store to fit you. If you run, and like to do distance on trail.. You will like the Caldera. Period end of story.",

110242,4,08/15/2017,"Back in Brooks! Soft stable ride on rugged trails. After years of running in Brooks, particularly Cascadia, I left when I perceived the shoes to be narrower, both in fit and aesthetics.  I have been running in another brand for the last 3 or 4 years.  This shoe brought me back when I couldn't find a higher cushioned shoe with a snug, but also dynamic fit.  So far I've put 50 miles of trail and rugged mountain running into my new Calderas.Though I wish they didn't look so pointy, the width is actually pretty great where I need it.  I have NOT experienced any instability due to stack height, and I really like the modest drop and wider forefoot.  My only two suggestions would be to square the toe rand a bit and add a little more armor to that area.  I run pretty rugged single-track in the Northern Rockies.  I now look to these shoes to soften long runs, and they are light for racing!  Thank you!Purchased locally at Bozeman Running Company.",
110242,4,08/08/2017,"Good in Blue I have no car, so I walk everywhere in these shoes.  I purchased the shoes in blue in a 10.  The padding under the ball of my foot is like a cushioned spring, propelling me forward faster than usual, which I liked.  I wore a thin crew sock, and the shoe felt 2 big.  My foot is a 9.5, and the shoe in a 9.5 was 2 small.  The size 10 felt a bit big, and after walking for miles, my right toes hurt pretty bad size 10).  I returned them and tried the shoe in the dark gray/black color.  The shoe was snugger in width, and the arch on the right shoe was higher, killing my foot within just a few blocks.  Brooks takes FOREVER to refund, so unless you need 90 days to try the shoes, get them somewhere else.  I ended up buying a pair of thicker hiking socks, and purchasing the shoes in blue from an online retailer.  The shoe in a 10 fits better, and the soft socks keep the toe box material from irritating my feet.",
110242,4,08/01/2017,Like my shoes ,
110242,4,07/18/2017,"Design Changes I used to run on the original Cascadia, the first iteration.  I loved that shoe.  As Brooks continued the Cascadia ,  I believe the shoe Declined.  I do not wear that shoe any longer, to heavy, bulky, from the original.   I am really frustrated with companies coming out with a great shoe and then changing the design.  I have been through 2 other companies  over the past 3 years and now back to the brooks Caldera.   This is a great show.  If you make design changes, make it lighter and make the toe box open like the Topo Mt2.  Other than that the platform is great.  I hope I do not have to switch companies again when you change the shoe drastically.  Thank You,  Matt   fourwindsexpeditions.com",
110242,2,07/17/2017,"Slippery When Wet This shoe does not do wet.  I was a huge Cascadia fan, but the drop and the weight are too much for distances.  I ended up switching to the Saucony Peregrine as alternative to the Cascadia.  When I found the Caldera I was stoked because this shoe has similar specs to the Peregrine and I have always loved Brooks shoes.  The shoe is comfortable, but a little too flexible on top for trails with lots of uneven surfaces.  Feels like I am waiting to roll an ankle.  Creeks and rocks I used to run across in the Cascadia, and now do in the Peregrine, I can barely tip toe through without slipping.  I have tried it no less than 10 times and they just don't do wet and slippery.  I think if I ran dry, relatively even trails these would probably be great shoes.",
110242,4,07/17/2017,"Great Road to Trail Shoe I've had Adrenaline ASR's for years and really enjoyed the comfort in moving back and forth from trail to road.  With Brooks seeming to phase out of the ASRs, I went looking for a new shoe.  I tried the standard road Adrenaline GTS, but it was just ok.  I've thought for a while that I didn't need the support of the Adrenaline line so I went looking for an alternative road/trail shoe.  After trying on a dozen pairs or more, I settled on the Caldera.  These are my first fat soled shoes and so far I love them.  I ran a good trail test over 14 miles of the continental divide trail and have since done 15 miles of road/trail (gravel) near my house.  The Caldera have handled all surfaces well and the cushion feels amazing.  I definitely notice the difference in my legs/joints after a long run.  So far they seem like the perfect shoes for my combination of road and trail running.  I'm waiting to see how they feel after 300+ miles, but so far, so good!",
110242,5,07/06/2017,"Best Brooks Hiking/Trail Shoe I've tried so far! I have owned the Cascadia, and Addiction trail shoes, but so far the Caldera is the best I have owned. I have taken them out for roughly ten hikes totalling about fifty miles, both on hilly and flat terrain. The grip in rough terrain (rocks and sand) has been really good! There is novelty to the midline cushioning running the length of the shoe. I expected that would result in a higher rate of ankle turns, but that hasn't happened. So the cushioning is an unexpected plus, while still providing a good feel for the trail!",
110242,5,07/03/2017,"These shoes have become a body part. I'm into my third pair of the Caldera's and they just get better everytime! Each pair have given me consistently the same wear mileage of almost 500 miles and even then I still wear them out for hikes as I wear my next pair. Amazing traction throughout its lifespan, and the shoe seriously adjusts to your foot width as you ""break"" the shoes in. My only suggestion and not even a complaint because the traction is truly amazing, but for the muddy stuff maybe increase the lug depth a milimeter or two. But then no shoe rocks in the mud!",
110242,3,06/30/2017,"Durability issues I want to like this shoe. It fits well and supplies a good amount of traction. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of durability. I wore this shoe for a local 50k and the Highlands Sky 40 and after those two races, it's done. The upper is beginning to separate from the sole in several places and the outsole is torn up to the point that chunks are missing. If Brooks would give this shoe a little more in the way of durability, it would be my go to shoe for virtually any ultra.",
110242,5,06/24/2017,A spring in my step!! ,
110242,3,05/23/2017,"Not for hot weather I do like the caldera, however, I wore this shoe for a 50k this afternoon and would not recommend it if running in hot weather. My feet felt like they were on fire in the 70-degree weather. I was wearing normal thickness wool socks. They provide a lot of cushioning and energy with every step - I really like that. The grip is really nice and they look really good, too.My only other issue besides the breathability is that, since the sole is so thick and the toe box is soooo wide, I don't feel stable while running on uneven trails (sloped down or up). On even trails with rocks/roots, everything is good though.I'll probably give this another shot in a race, but definitely not on a hot day. All of my training runs in this shoe were fine. I love walking around in this shoe because it's so comfortable.",
110242,5,05/17/2017,Great Buy! First time trying these. Tons of cushioning and good traction. Would definitely buy again.,
110242,4,05/09/2017,"Good Trail Shoe... Room For Improvement. The Caldera is a smart buy for those looking to get into trail running that prefer a soft ride. This shoe is noticeably softer and lighter than the Cascadia and Cascadia GTX. Unfortunately I think the Caldera has some room for improvement. I didn't feel confident navigating more difficult terrain because the soft sole and flexible upper felt like it gave too much from side to side especially on loose rocks. The traction was not good enough for very wet muddy trails. Softness is always a tradeoff for support so many soft EVA foam shoes use full frames to compensate. Make sure to use this shoe with a good insert such as a Superfeet insole. Brooks could improve the stability of the shoe by adding a blown rubber midsole similar to the Transcend and improving the outsole for more rugged terrain. Overall this is a good trail shoe, an impressive debut, but has room for improvement. Try it out and look out for V2.",
110242,5,04/25/2017,"More Than I Expected I picked up my first pair of Caldera's in January out of curiosity at a time that I was needing a new trail shoe for longer runs. I was amazed by how well this shoe performed! Running on ice and snow for a lot of the shoes life, it gripped like the Cascadia on dry trails, incredible. The cushion gets better the harder the impact like technical steep downhills and as I increase speed the shoe continues to push forward. I got 540 miles out of my shoes and the only break down was in the upper where normal crease points are and they wore through exposing my foot, not a complaint after 540 miles! I'm now into my second pair and just recently completed a 50 mile race in them that included lots of mud, which the shoes shed very well. My only criticism of the shoe is the lace pocket on the tongue. I lace all the way up through the top eyelet and the lace pocket is completely buried under the laces and is unusable. Could you either make the pocket more accessible or just remove it all together, the extra material gets in the way when I untie the laces and loosen them up. That's it. love this shoe!",
110242,4,04/22/2017,"Bounce The Brooks Caldera is now my new trail shoe.I have been a Hoka guy since they came out but since Decker took them over the shoes have changed in quality. They used to use a high end EVA now they have gone to a much firmer (cheaper) EVA that is unforgiving and with no energy return, and after only 60 miles the Challenger ATR  gets even harder as they flatten out. The Hoka speedgoat  is a uncomfortable and unstable shoe and the Stinson ATR is now just a plodding foot coffin from what it used to be. This is where the Brooks Caldera comes in. While it's not as thick as the Hoka Clifton ATR  the Caldera's Bio-Mogo EVA is a far superior cushion with great energy return.The shoes actually feel like they give you a bounce! Plus the toe off is excellent giving it a much more fun feel the dead thud of the Hoka. My only negative was when running on a steep side cantor my foot slips more than I would like but it's a minor issue. I used a after market insole that solved the issue. Even though the lugs aren't that deep they provide excellent traction. The Caldera feels light on my feet and in turns makes me run lighter and faster. A very enjoyable ride.",
110242,4,04/20/2017,"great, but i'm an old dog, 57, big hiker and avid trail runner.  Primarily as a trail runner over extremely rough, hard , rocky, rutted and dry terrain, i have used a lot of different shoes , some were great, others not so much, unfortunately, just when you're really liking a shoe the manufacturer will change it and often times ruin it.   I have recently been running and hiking in Cascadia's,  great fit, nice directional control, good durability, poor downhill traction, and too hard under foot, so i was looking for a more plush ride with better traction, The Caldera's are amazing plush under foot, minimal rock impact feel underfoot, they do seem a little tall underfoot, tend to roll more on rough uneven stuff, the toe box is definitely roomy, i have to lace that end pretty snug to keep my foot focused , otherwise you get to much side to side movement and the shoe will shift underfoot, once you figure out lacing and the quirks , traction seems very good so far , they are a pleasant ride, if they put most (not all) of this cushioning in the Cascadia, that would probably be the perfect shoe, i bought a second pair of these and time will tell on durability, my trails are pretty brutal at times, at this point i would recommend these,  the voluminous toe box is my biggest gripe.",
110242,3,04/12/2017,Too soft If you like the first iterations of the pure grit then you won't like this shoe. It is too tall too much cushion. I tried it because the new puregrit is to tight on the top of my foot.,
110242,3,04/09/2017,"Great comfort, poor durability Very comfortable shoe. Similar to Hokas. Was hoping the Caldera might be more durable, like other Brooks shoes, but they tore open at about 150 miles. About the same as Hoka's famously poor durability. And these cost more. Disappointed. Still looking for a trail racing shoe that will last a month.",
110242,5,04/03/2017,Great trail running shoe! I really like these. I am glad that Brooks added the Velcro strip to attach gaiters. There is lots of room in the toe box and the shoes have great traction.,

Great toe box, not too voluminous but substantial.  Uber cushion.  Gaiter grip.

Make laces a little more self gripping when tightened.  Never discontinue...",
110242,5,03/09/2017,"Awesome These shoes are great.  I used to wear the Glyverin but the newer models weren't supporting me as much.  Thought I'd try this as I liked the look.  So far, fantastic.",

I have worn the Cascadia in 100 mile races and loved the comfort with no blister or toe issues, but really wished for a lighter shoe.  The Caldera seems to have all that I had hoped for from an update to the Cascadia.  Lighter, more cushioning and still comfortable.  It has plenty of room in the toe box and the grip is great for most trails.  I can't wait to try them out in my next ultra-marathon.",

If you like the Altra Lone Peaks but enjoy a 4mm drop these are the shoes for you. My achilles can't handle the zero drop so when i saw these I instantly jumped on them, and I'm happy I did. They drain great running through water, toe protection is perfect, wide toe box, awesome traction. I'm hoping to use these on my next 50k race and so far training on these has been a pleasure.",
110242,5,12/11/2016,"Brooks' best trail running shoe When I first saw the description of the Caldera online, I was thinking it was Brooks' version of a max-cushion shoe, meant to compete with the Altra Olympus or the Hoka Mafate or Speedgoat.  Since I'm a big fan of max-cushion trail runners, I immediately pre-ordered it.  When it arrived, I was skeptical.  It has the usual high-quality materials and workmanship typical of Brooks shoes, but when I walked around the house in them, I could tell they were not even close to the soft cushioning of Altra or Hoka.  I almost sent them back without even running in them.  Now I'm glad I didn't.  I took them out for my standard trail run, 10k with about 800 feet of elevation gain over some fairly rocky terrain.  The cushioning doesn't really activate until you run in them, but they definitely have more cushion than the Cascadia, and they also have a noticeable bounce to them.  The traction is excellent, and I've never run in a more stable shoe.  When I finished, I had beat my previous PR by almost 3 minutes.  My only minor concern is that the lugs are fairly shallow, so I'll have to see how well they hold up over more miles.  But I'm definitely sold on the Caldera.",
110243,4,12/27/2017,Love them but they are not the color they advertised The shoes are great. I bought them for stability and longevity and so far they exactly that. The only problem is the picture showed the color to be grey and red. However the packing slip says hunter green and orange. They just were not the color the website advertised.,

110243,4,12/15/2017,"cascadia stays my favorite for neutral and durability I have bought cascadias for years.  My favorites are still the cascadia 10, but the line is always good.  The styling is a bit edgy, but I always look at the women's shoes in my size because other makers save their wild colorways for the ladies...  Brooks mens designs satisfy my desire for loud shoes.  I pay less for cascadias, and they last 4 times as long as my other, more expensive shoes.  Solid off-road traction and the treads last a long time, even on sandstone.  Obviously cascadias are a bit heavier than a minimal trail shoe, but the weight is never cumbersome, and usually just feels like a bit more confidence and security.",
110243,1,11/29/2017,"Great shoe for narrow foot Tried this shoe for a month. Wanted it to work because it had all the properties of a great show except one: made for a narrow foot. Unwearable. Caused a lot of pain. No excuse for making a narrow shoe, because you can always pull the laces tighter or add an insert if a shoe is gigantically large. Currently I'm still wearing several Cascadia 9's that were not narrow.",
110243,1,11/28/2017,"Poorly designed shoe, difficult to adjust, runs small. This was the worst designed show I'd ever tried from Brooks.  The shoe uses a combination of loops and holes for the laces, making it difficult to orient your hands for tightening them. Loops require you to pull toward your leg, holes require you to pull up.And the lace hole in the tongue is offset, allowing the tongue to be misaligned when you slip them on.  And they were uncomfortable.Brooks shoes have evolved since my first pair in 2000 and for the worst.  They used to offer shoes specifically for supination but that doesn't appear to be the case anymore.  Their shoes are no longer comfortable.  I've since switched to a different brand of shoe.Plus they seem to be in a competition for the world's ugliest shoe, which doesn't interest me either.",
110243,5,11/20/2017,Yes Solid shoe. Fits great for me and is perfect for rugged trail. If I had to be a picky critic I would say it is a bit heavy. The True Grit a light option but is a 4 mm drop so is a bit of a jump in heel to toe drop.,
110243,5,11/03/2017,I have bought these again and again ,
110243,5,10/30/2017,Simply a good thru hiking shoe that ill stick with UI didnt run in my brooks but i hiked the Appalachian Trail trail with my Cascadia 12s and put down 980 miles on my first pair before finally switching to Cacadia 11s regardless the Cascadia model is by far the best trail hiking shoe soe so if you guys produce a actual hikinf shoe you have your first buyer and tester just saying. But completed the trail with both pair of shoes being Cascadias so keep up the good work and Ill keep testing the heck out of shoes.,
110243,5,10/18/2017,"I will purchase again I love this shoe.  I run on natural surfaces mostly and have used Adrenaline, Glycerin, and Neuro.  Liked these a lot as well except for wear.  Contacted Brooks and the rep suggested the Cascadia and now know why they are the experts.  My first time out set a new personal record for a 5k.  Only suggestion if you try this shoe, and if your feet sweat you may want a darker color (mine are lime green) as the sweat on the shoe soaks up the dust and creates heavy sweat stains that will not come out.  Other wise great, I will get a darker color next time",

I've got 300 miles of trail/mountain running around Bozeman MT on my pair of Cascadias and I couldn't be happier.  Pearl Izumis used to be a great fit for me but I would completely wear them out in 150-175 miles, which was a waste of money.  I've got about double that on these guys and they're not quite trashed yet and still feel good to run in.  I hope the fit stays the same once the Cascadia 13 comes out.",

110243,1,09/13/2017,"Poor build quality Warning: extremely poor build. I have put ~150 miles on these shoes and they have not held up. My first (and last) experience with Brooks. The first 75 miles on these shoes were sweet... lightweight, good support, etc. However, tears/splits in the fabric began right around 75 miles. The photo of the shoes show a bright orange sock balled-up in one shoe and the other shoe has my fingers sticking out so you can get a sense of the splits (and how bad they are)... tears/splits on both sides of both shoes. Blue coloring on toes began coming off after about mile 50 (which I could care less about).  I politely contacted Brooks but they have thus far ignored me. I know that my star rating differs drastically from other reviewers... this could be an amazing shoe if the build was better or if you are able to replace the shoes often (money not being a concern to you). Yes, I was using them on rough terrain but no way a shoe should break down this fast. I am an experienced hiker.

110243,5,06/20/2017,Best Shoe Ever! I definitely give the trails above Tucson a pounding on a regular basis and this shoe is ready for the task. I've been wearing the Cascadia since its 6th iteration and have been in love ever since. Somehow the 12 feels better than ever and from the very first run felt like a shoe made just for me. Super stable and the right amount of cushion for a sweet ride.,
110243,4,06/13/2017,"Great Shoes! These shoes are the best running shoes I have worn since the early 1990s.  And I have bought a lot of shoes.  These are old school in the way that the sole is made.  They are rather stiff (and that is a good thing), and the sole has a smooth rounded bend (not sharp at some point like most shoes).  I love these shoes.  I bought a pair about 4 years ago which I also liked.  This new 2017 version has, I believe, a some improvement in the shoe I bought 4 years ago.  HOWEVER, BROOKS I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS, the upper is not as nice as the ones 4 years ago.  the upper mesh on the cascadias from 4 years ago was much more comfortable (and also more attractive).  The upper on this latest version is too tight in the toes.  I actually have to lace my shoes beginning half way up the shoe, because the string puts pressure on a sore big toe (arthritis in the toe).  But the shoes from 4 years ago feel much better in the upper.  STILL YET, these shoes are the best I have found.  I tried HOKA and Altra both.  But these Cascadias win.  They are the best shoes I have worn since the early 1990s.  The soles on these shoes is the very best I have worn.  AND IMPORTANTLY, You do NOT have to use these as trail shoes.  I run on the roads in them.",
110243,4,06/01/2017,"Sturdy, strong but heavy I fully tore the ATFL in my ankle on the trails just over a year ago with a very light shoe, then re-injured it a year later so I move to this shoe to get more support and hopefully keep me on the trail. The stability is fantastic and I feel really confident on the trail even as the ankle continues to gain strength. I'm a supinator so these shoes have actually reduced some of that. So for that reason I recommend these shoes, especially for stability or injury recovery. That said, man they are heavy. I'm not going to win any short races in these things and my times have dipped, but most importantly they are keeping me on the trails, which right now is the most important thing. I'll look for something more nimble in my next pair and I gain strength in my ankle.",
110243,5,05/31/2017,Great Trail Shoe ,
110243,4,05/12/2017,Good Shoe- Too Pricey I have put a few thousand miles on Cascadias between the current model and Last years model. The current model is a step up and in the right direction. I am a fan of these shoes and are my go to pair for longer days on the trails. Traction is good for the compromise of being able to comfortably run on pavement sections and hard packed trails. Very rarely have my foot slip on steep terrain. The shoe protects your foot from rocks quite well. I very rarely care about foot placement as I do not feel the rocks through these shoes. Where other shoes I need to be more delicate. These shoes are durable and stand up to a lot of miles.Cons- They are heavy.  They are also very expensive. Almost like you are getting charged by the ounce. Their price has made me branch out of my Cascadia Comfort zone and try other shoes. In Fact I may have purchased my last pair of them. All in all great trainer and long run shoe. If Brooks ever decides to become competitive on price I'll come back to the shoe.,
110243,5,05/04/2017,"A Consistently Well Designed Trail Shoe I am a professional fitter and avid trail runner so I know shoes! It is so nice to see Brooks stick to their guns by keeping this edition of the Cascadia sturdy and biomechanically sound even in the wake of a full blown fad of ultra-light, super cushioned shoes. Foam density is inversely correlated with lightness and softness. While the ultra-cushioned movement (in response to the barefoot movement 5-6 years ago) has given us lighter and softer shoes, there is always a trade off with durability and reactivity (no matter what the company claims). The Cascadia is heavier than say a Hoka challenger or Altra trail shoe, but the durability and control of the shoe is unbeatable. The Cascadia is rugged and the upper is very well integrated with the sole. A challenge of any trail shoe design is to make it stand up to the twisting motions of the runners foot on challenging surfaces like slick mud, sand on hard surfaces or loose rocks. I feel confident bombing down any hill even with tricky surfaces in these shoes. There is a reason this shoe has survived 12 editions. Look for this shoe to stay faithful to the needs of trail runners for years to come!",
110243,5,04/22/2017,"Great trail running and light hiking shoe! Use for hiking and trail running on a variety of trails. They provide excellent traction up and down hill, adequate cushioning, and good protection underfoot. Good trail feel on rocky terrain.",

Great traction, stable, cushions well.  Snug fit for my narrow feet, but with room in the toe box to avoid rubbing.  Good arch support for my high arches.  I haven't had them long enough to speak to the durability, but I'm happy with everything so far!",
110243,2,04/20/2017,"Not what I hoped. I've worn at least 6 or 7 iterations of the Cascadia.  I did think the upper fit on this shoe was better than the 11, and the traction was great.  That's all the positve words I have for these shoes.  I found the shoe forced my foot to pronate, and initially the outside of the shoe (the side opposite of my arch) felt as though it had stiff lumps in it.  After trying to break the shoes in, and doing a few trail runs in them I started to feel a significant pain in my foot, what I would associate with a shoe that it attempting to stop my foot from supinating.  I called Brooks to ask if the last or the sole of the shoe had changed and was told the only thing that changed was the upper, but after looking at the 11 and the 12 with a running shoe store associate we could see that the shoe had changed in a few ways, as the last appears to be more curved and the density zones are much different.  I did try on another pair to make sure it wasn't simply the shoes I had purchased and experience the same discomfort in the other pair as well.  I did notice that in a prominent trail running magazine reported that some testers of the Mazama felt that it forced them to pronate as well.  Sadly, I just bought a pair of Launch 4's after having had 2 pair's of the Launch 3's and I am experiencing a bit of the same sensations.  It's not quite as pronounced but it's there.  I think it would be great if running shoe companies would quit radically changing their shoes in the name of ""progress"", and just focus on making a high quality product, and if works well then don't change a thing.",
110243,4,04/16/2017,"Love my Cascadia 12s.  Hate the color options. I've been hiking in theses since early January and love these shoes.  I've hiked in a myriad of environments from mud, to root filled trails, to solid rock balds to packed dirt and they performed well on all of them.  I even threw a pair of micro spikes over them and took them up an icy climb to the top of Mt. LeConte.  I got a little over 200 miles out of my first pair and the grip is really gone at this point.  Seems like a decent amount of sole left, but they've just lost that really grippy feeling they used to have.  On my second pair now and they feel just like my worn in, comfy pair right out of the box.  I'm sure it won't be my last pair.  Just wish they were a little more durable.  Oh, while at the end of the day, the color choices don't mess with the performance, they really need to go back to the design table and come up with some better color options.   I feel like all of these were misses and I was choosing the lesser of evils.  At the end of the day though, they make my feet happy.  :)",
110243,5,04/15/2017,"Excellent update! Took them out of the box and ran 22 miles in them the very next day, no blisters and no discomfort. The wider, roomier toe box made for and awesome, already-broken-in feel. I had no problems with grip and was very satisfied with their response.",
110243,5,03/30/2017,"Very happy and impressed with these shoes! I would highly reccomend this show to those wanting a sturdy, confortabke trail running shoe. It assists your every stride to ensure a smooth and comfortable step while still fitting snug and feeling durable.",
110243,5,03/09/2017,"Great trail shoe I have been a beast fan for over 20 years. Following wet conditions and traction trouble at a few ultras, I decided to try the cascadias. I was not disappointed. They are lighter, though not quite as cushioned as the beast. The grip is great.",
110243,4,01/07/2017,"Definitely improved I have been wearing the Cascadia shoes for trail running since v5. Some versions have been better than others with the 8s being my favorite and the 10s being the least favorite. I ordered the 12s as soon as they were released because the 11s, although more durable than the 10s were pretty much the same.  Right out of the box these 12s are a better version than the last two.  I have taken them for out for runs every day since their arrival with 3"" of powdery snow covering the trails.  The toe box on these 12s is wider which is immediately noticeable.  I don't have a wide foot but versions 9,10, and 11 seemed to feel more narrow.  The new lug design on the bottom really handled the snow well.  The upper is a tougher material reminiscent of the 8s.  I expect these will last the life of the shoe and not tear apart prematurely. There are less overlays on this version which for me is a big plus.  Ever since the change to welded overlays (which for some reason most shoe manufacturers have gone to) the shoes don't seem as comfortable because they didn't seem to conform to my foot as well. Besides less overlays this model returned to a sewn down toe cap which to me makes the shoe more flexible therefore more comfortable.  Soft snow is on the ground but I expect this version to be every bit as cushioning as all the past versions which is why I have stayed with the Cascadia.  My initial impression is that the 12s are an improvement to an already excellent long distance trail running shoe.",
110244,5,12/27/2017,"Launch 4  is another great Brooks shoe Feels slightly narrower than my last pair but still comfortable.   Love the company, their shoes and return policy.   Delivery was quick.   New colors and patterns give you plenty of choices.",
110244,4,12/26/2017,Great training shoe. 25 miles per week. ,

I have used Brooks since I started running 7 years ago; they were the only manufacturer at the time to fit without issues. 7 years later after thousands of miles and several models of Brooks I am still hooked! Oh and a Union Jack, no words needed!",
110244,4,12/19/2017,"Solid shoe Overall a solid shoe, fit is slightly larger than previous version but purchased online and didn't try on in store. Quality construction and nice look.",

110244,5,12/18/2017,"Very well received Xmas gift These shoes were purchased as a gift for my brother, so I can't comment on their actual power as a running shoe.  They're beautiful though, clearly made of quality materials.",
110244,4,12/16/2017,Mostly comfortable trainer ,
110244,5,12/13/2017,"250 miles in, shoe has been great for putting in the miles Bought this shoe when my last ""go to"" shoe (from a different company) got replaced. I've found the Launch 4 to be responsive (even quick) when I need it to be, but also very comfortable as a workhorse type shoe. I have averaged 40-50 miles a week in them, and they continue to be comfortable. The upper feels almost glove like, and I've had zero hot spot issues.  I've just ordered a second pair, and see this line as my new go to shoe.",
110244,5,12/08/2017,they look and feel great ,
110244,5,12/05/2017,2nd time around ,
110244,5,12/05/2017,Awesome shoes Shoes are great. They do seem to run a half size too small. My left foot is 10.5 and my right is 11.  I ordered size 11. The left foot feels great but the right feels too tight. I'll buy another pair but 11.5 this time.,
110244,5,11/30/2017,"Highly satisfied with these Shoes I just purchased these after running the year in the Ghost 9s, and the feel is completely different, but very much a nice change of pace. The design of the sole almost propels you forward as you are running, giving you a nice energetic feel (just as the shoe description states :)). The overall shoe fits identically to me past Brooks, but the toe design is a little funny at first; it almost feels like your foot is slipping forward (which, it is not). After getting used to this, it was a non-issue. Would recommend to those looking for something great and middle of the road for feel.",
110244,5,11/28/2017,great shoe ! good support  fits great ,
110244,4,11/28/2017,"Perfect, but 2nd time's the charm I originally had the electric blue versions of the launch 4s and I loved them, but they wore down and started to tear after only 2 months of running (I was doing 20-30 mile weeks) so I returned them and re-bought another pair in the hopes that they last a bit longer. I hope these turn out better and so far they seem to be doing well.",
110244,4,11/28/2017,"First time Launch user. This is my second pair of Brooks. First pair was the Ghost 8. Brooks seem to come a half size small, so my usual size 9 is a 91/2 in Brooks. Not a big deal, just be aware if ordering online. Compared to Ghost, the Launch toe box is 'thinner' material, and not a lot of support up front. No problem for road use, but may not be the best for 'off' road. I typically replace the insole with a semi-orthotic for arch support (in the Ghost). Did not work so well in the Launch. Launch seems to have more arch support, so I put the 'stock' insoles back in. Lighter than the Ghost, a little 'looser' in the toe area, but very comfortable.",
110244,5,11/26/2017,Crustaceans sensations Bought these for my son who is a CC runner. He normally wears the launch for training and decided to go with the ode to Boston marathon lobsters. The shoe doesn't have a seem at the toe which my son loves. The seem on the standard launchs rip after several months. He runs 50-70 miles a week and these have worn well.,
110244,5,11/25/2017,"I would recommend this shoe to others The shoes are comfy and feel like the appropriate length and width for their size. They do feel a little tight over the top of the foot where one would knot their laces, but they can break in with use.",
110244,5,11/22/2017,Very comfortable I cannot run any more but walk a great deal. I actually wear these all the time.,
110244,4,11/20/2017,"After first week On the first day of allowing the shoe to stretch after a long day of using it was quite helpful. After using it a few more times for running and other exercises I find the shoe true to fit. It feels nice, my only complaint is that I wish in the toe box there was a little bit more springiness. Other than that the shoe is quite comfortable and light.",
110244,5,11/19/2017,I would buy these over and over again Use these shoes for everyday use. Some days I will have them on for 16 hours. Really like them.,
110244,5,11/18/2017,Yes I feel great support thru heel and arches.  Far superior to any other running shoe I've ever worn.,
110244,5,11/17/2017,"Great running shoe I recently began running again after a hiatus for several years. I have been running in Ravennas as they were the best fit for me. I ventured out to try the Launch shoes and they much better than I had anticipated. My first run was a short 2 miles to get a feel for them, my next run was a six miler and my feet felt fantastic afterwards. I felt as though I could have kept going several more miles without issue. I will defiantly get another pair after these wear out!!",
110244,2,11/15/2017,"Maybe next time 2 stars because did not meet my expectations based on the description of the shoe: ""The new Launch 4 delivers runners an extra-springy ride. Designed to pick up the pace, these neutral running shoes features slightly more blown rubber in the forefoot for a more powerful toe-off plus an updated Air Mesh upper for an even lighter-on-foot fit and increased ventilation.""So this is just my opinion - it does not feel ""extra-springy"".  To me if feels quite stiff but at the same time it does not feel ""responsive"" because my feet feel tired on it after a 4-5 mile run (this is in contrast to the Ghost (though slightly more bulky which I don't mind) and Adidas Pureboost ZG).  While the Saucony Guide is a different category of running shoe I actually feel that that shoe is quite springy and responsive.",
110244,3,11/15/2017,"The launch 4 isn't for me I have never worn the Launch prior to this purchase, they feel to narrow and one size to small. I've run in Adrenaline, Revanna and now only the ghost, always wear size 11. Thought I'd try something different because of color and reviews. They are the wrong choice for me.",
110244,4,11/14/2017,Yes brooks makes a great running shoe ,
110244,5,11/11/2017,Would absolutely buy this shoe again. ,
110244,5,11/11/2017,Great shoe Overall this shoe works well considering the miles I run. Very supportive and well balanced. Highly recommend this shoe,
110244,5,11/08/2017,"Pittsburgh marathon edition is awesome! I bought them before the 2017 Pittsburgh marathon, and ran the half with them. They have been my go-to shoes since then, with ~300 miles on them. Still holding up, but being replaced by Ravenna's and another pair of Launch's (4 or 5, not sure yet).",
110244,4,11/07/2017,"good shoe for the money. Good shoe, like the fabric choices compared to other style of shoes from brooks.",
110244,3,11/07/2017,"Decent running shoe I bought these as my primary running shoe.  I am trying to get them worn-in to see if they fit and feel better because they seem much narrower than the other Brooks I have and have had in the past.  I have purchased around 10 pair of Brooks and while I love the look of these shoes, the narrowness cuts off my circulation while running making my toes and parts of my feet numb after 1-2 miles.  I am hoping that after another month or so they will be broken in and that goes away.  We will see.",
110244,2,11/07/2017,"Mid-sole is way too stiff now, bring back the orginal! These shoes looked very similar to the Launch 2, I didn't expect such a drastic change to the mid-sole. The mid-soles are very stiff causing me to use more effort to get these shoes to flex while running. I could tell as soon as put these shoes on and walked around they weren't as cushioning as previous models, but thought once I got use to them and slowly worked them into my shoe rotation I would be good and I'd adapt to them.After owning them for over 4 months, and I've only logged 56.8 miles running on them I have to pull them from my rotation. I purchased two pair of these shoes, assuming they would be very similar to the Launch 2 that have proved to be fairly successful for me. So I'm returning the 2nd pair since I did not wear them, and I even called Brooks to discuss with them the issue I was experience and they said their policy is 90 days for shoes that have been worn outside. They basically didn't care about the issue I was having nor that I have never had any problems with Brooks shoes until now. Truly disappointed Brooks, I'm not sure I can recommend your shoes anymore. I have been running exclusively with Brooks Launch shoes since 2010, I've ran in 20 pair of the original Launches and 8 of the Launch 2's. Needless to say, I'm probably the most experienced runner when it comes to Brooks Launch. I have logged over 10,000 miles in the original Brooks Launch and the Brooks Launch 2, with a majority of those miles being in the original. The Launch 2 were okay, but they seems to wear out faster on the soles and the uppers would get holes in them whereas that would never happen on the original Launches.I'd recommend for those looking at the Launches to look elsewhere, many other manufactures are making shoes that are very similar to the original Launches.",
110244,4,11/06/2017,"This is a great shoe, but not my favorite. I have been running in the Ravenna since 2009 and I am used to that.  The Launch is a really good shoe meant for a bit less support and to be a ""faster"" shoe than the Ravenna.  It is that, I just prefer the Ravenna.",
110244,5,11/03/2017,"The London 2017 turns heads, along with the Lobsters Bostons Comfort has been great, I have had to move to these from minimalist shoes and it's been great.  Style is awesome as well.",
110244,5,11/01/2017,"Comfortable, perfect fit, would recommend them to anyone! I'm a nurse aide so I am always on my feet and with these after I get off from a 12 hour shift my feet aren't sore like they have been with other shoes!",
110244,5,11/01/2017,"My go-to training shoe! Since the Launch came out, it's been my go-to trainer. I remember at one point it was almost discontinued, but thankfully Brooks values customer feedback. Love the Launch! #ReviewSweeps",

110244,5,10/27/2017,"Hesitant, but WoW! I have always been hesitant to buy brooks. The main knock is that they wear out to fast. But this pair are amazing. Light, comfortable, look great. Very happy with my purchase.",
110244,4,10/24/2017,"Very satisfied. Comfortable shoe. I bought this pair with a coupon code after owning a similar pair. I feel comfortable in them for the most part. Rocks do lodge in the soles of you run in gravel, but not terrible. I notice myself slowing down on turns as I feel a little ""high"" in the shoe and feel my foot slide. I also noticed my feet slide on the insole when sprinting. Overall, I love this shoe. Very springy with nice feel of road.",
110244,5,10/23/2017,"This shoe is for real! I run cross country and this is undoubtedly a great all-around trainer.  The sole is comfortable, the construction has stability and flexibility, but the ""springiness"" I get when I run is definitely the best part about these shoes (not to mention the colors are AWESOME!).  This is my first pair of Brooks and I am really impressed.  I would definitely buy these again and I highly recommend them.",
110244,5,10/23/2017,Improved flexibility compared to the Launch 3. Will continum I compete in the jumps and the Launch 4 is a versatile training shoe suitable for fast running and plyometric exercises as well as distance runs.,
110244,5,10/19/2017,Love them! I used them to my First Full Marathon Race in Chicago and I survived without my toes cramping.  The Medium fit perfectly to my wide feet.  I used the 2017 London Marathon design and I received a lot of compliments.  I just bought my third Launch 4 pair with the 2017 Boston Marathon Lobster and I'll be using them to run RNR in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks!,
110244,5,10/17/2017,"Best Launch Yet I am so pleased with these shoes. Been clinging to the Launch 2's for several cycles (run five times a week, 20 miles per, replacing shoes after 500 miles) because the Launch 3's weren't a good fit. The 4's are a perfect fit. Snug enough to hold my sometimes problematic big toe in place, light as can be and soft and springy to the step. Even some knee discomfort I'd been having seems to be relieved by these new shoes. I couldn't endorse them more enthusiastically.",
110244,5,10/17/2017,"Great daily and uptempo trainer This shoe has been a great daily trainer for me as I train for middle distance races. It works well at relaxed paces and as fast as 6 minutes per mile to cover most of my training needs. I prefer running in a road flat for anything under 6 minutes per mile but can certainly imagine this being a ""do everything"" shoe for many people. My two minor complaints are that the heel feels somewhat bulky for the first 50-100 miles of the shoe's use and the length of the forefoot rubber treads gives a slight wobbly feel the shoe before being worn down a little. That being said, this shoe was an excellent daily trainer for me for over 400 miles which is why I am buying a replacement pair. Please continue down this road for the Launch.",

They're the first style of Brooks I ever owned after taking Brook's online survey to find my fit. After years of having to put inserts in my shoes for plantar fasciitis, these were the first pair of running shoes I ever owned that didn't give me any trouble, hence why I'm on my third pair.

110244,5,06/05/2017,Excellent & Awesome! ,
110244,5,06/05/2017,Everyday trainer I use these shoes as an everyday trainer and just ran a marathon in them. PR of 2:47. I run 6-7 days a week and about 75 miles a week when training for a marathon and 40-50 when taking a break from marathons. Launch typically last me about 250 miles.,
110244,5,06/04/2017,"Great everyday running shoe I had been wearing Pure Flow's for past three years, which were great (especially Flow 3's) but started to develop low level heel pain. Wanted to try something w a little more cushioning, yet light weight, and the Launch 4 has been just what Dr. ordered. They have an amazing feel without the bulk and weight. I use them as my everyday running shoe, short and long distances. Since the heel drop is quite different from Flow's, it did take a little adjustment. But overall, this is a great everyday running shoe.",
110244,5,05/29/2017,Great Shoes This is my second pair of Launch shoes and I love them. Very comfortable and light weight.,
110244,4,05/26/2017,"Comfortable I bought these for my teenage son because he has extremely flat feet and this was one of the brands recommended by the doctor because it offers good heel support.  He wears orthodics for arch support.  Fortunately he was able to find design/colors that he likes.  Lots of color options on-line so we ordered from the website.  Tried on the three brands in the store that were recommended and he liked these the best.  Will probably have to stick to this brand for life.  His first pair lasted less then a year, but he wears them everyday for everything and teenage boys are hard on their sneakers.  I think the price is not bad compared to some brands.  Come out with more designs!",
110244,5,05/23/2017,Given to our boss after he ran the Boston Marathon We gave them to our boss after he ran the 2017 Boston Marathon. He loved them!,
110244,5,05/14/2017,"Still good with the Launch I make running shoes last a long time. My original Launch went 1629mi. It was nice to buy another pair of Launch & be able to get a color scheme with NO white. Comfortable out-of-the-box. Interestingly, Brooks hasn't supplied with ridiculously long shoestrings like others I've had...and they stay tied!",
110244,4,05/12/2017,"Buy it For The Union Jack, Keep it For The Ride I typically wear a shoe with pronation control and I wish these had that feature.  I knew it was a neutral shoe before buying it so there were no real surprises.  They look great in Union Jack and they seem to work with my wonky feet and stride!Winner",
110244,3,05/11/2017,"L4 Least Favorite to Date I have been a loyal Launch wearer since the beginning of the shoe.  I have (4) Launch 1s, (2) Launch 2s, (1) Launch 3 and now a pair of Launch 4s.  Overall, the Launch 4 is my least favorite and I feel Brooks continues to digress from the spirit of this shoe. Pros:The upper is much improved over the L3s, feels more like the L2s.  Softer upper with a wider toebox.  Flexibility in the Forefoot is also improved from the L2/L3sCons:Heel is much firmer that the L2/L3s.  Almost a clunky feeling which takes away from the smooth transition of the past. Overall ride feels firm and not responsive.  I feel the L4s are the least cushioned and responsive of the four versions.  The L2s were springy and lively and the L1s were more cushioned yet still responsive.These may be okay for a 5K race but do not find myself reaching for them for a 10K or Half.  These are marketed as an Energize shoe, but have a hard time feeling it during a run. Hopefully Brooks will take the shoe back to the springy, cushioned feeling of the past.",
110244,3,05/08/2017,"So far I liked the Launch 3 better May be I should ""break them in"" some more, just two long runs and one treadmilland they seem a bit ""loose"" in the front",
110244,5,05/03/2017,"Launch Boston I run about 30 miles per week and love the Launch, my favorite shoe.  Love the Boston themed design, too.",
110244,5,04/29/2017,Awesome shoes! ,
110244,5,04/27/2017,"Comfortable, lightweight, great ride Although sold as a road shoe, I have done some rocky trail runs and it is quite comfortable.  A great lightweight trainer.",
110244,5,04/26/2017,"Comfortable, Light weight -- Great shoe Will continue to purchase shoes from this line -- Brooks got it right with the Launch",
110244,5,04/26/2017,"Exactly what I was looking for I used Brooks' shoe identify program and it suggested the Launch.  I am thrilled, it is working out great.",
110244,5,04/26/2017,"My favorite shoe Launch is always my favorite-- lightweight,  yet not quite minimal-- the best of both worlds! And I LOVE the design-- who else has lobsters on their running shoe?",
110244,5,04/25/2017,I have 8 pairs of the Launch.. so yes I'd buy it again. All of my brooks shoes I had to go up 1/2 size this year but not in other brands. I work at a shoe store.,
110244,5,04/22/2017,Ran fastest 5k ever with these on. Stiff and springy feel. Great shoe.  I switched from the ghost 9 and love the response. Good price point.,
110244,2,04/20/2017,Run a bit large/ returns are a nightmare Shoe was too big in toe box I liked them but 2 weeks to get a refund is ludicrous.,
110244,4,04/20/2017,"Good shoe close to great I have run in the Nike LunarGlide series for many years, and am used to the feel of those shoes.  The Launch is not as soft but what I will say is the grip is awesome.  Wet roads and sidewalks have not been an issue same for hills and small amounts of sand.    The right shoe is just a little narrow for me to do more than 2-3 miles in.  I Purchased these shoes for Ragnar Cape Cod this spring.  I think they will be my backup pair given the fit.",
110244,5,04/08/2017,"I WILL buy this shoe again and again 1) This is it! This is the shoe I've been waiting for. Perfect combination of cushioning, support and lightweight.2) The fit is much better than the Launch 3. And the forefoot upper support is snug without being uncomfortable.3) I can tell I'm gonna go thru at least 4 pairs of these.",
110244,5,04/06/2017,"Best shoe..! Great shoe. I use to use the pureflow, but I have moved up to the launch and its giving me a more comfortable run with very little weight added to the shoe.",
110244,5,04/04/2017,"Bought for my son...he loves them! My son really enjoys running around campus with his friends. By the way, he likes the ""fish"" design as well. Personally. I don't get it.",
110244,5,04/04/2017,"First pair, but they won't be my last! I wanted a serious pair of running shoes this season. Through some internet research I found that Brooks should have the fit I prefer: light with larger toe box. I decided at a local big box store I tried on a couple Brooks then a couple competitors. There's no comparison. The Brooks won on fit and feel. I ended up buying direct from Brooks.com. Customer service was spot on. I've worn them 10+ times on my elliptical and finally had decent enough weather for 5k yesterday. Felt great. I felt almost no change from beginning to end. Unless someone can drastically change my mind I'll be a Brooks customer from here out.",
110244,1,04/03/2017,"Narrow...way too narrow! I couldn't wear them for more than a couple minutes, the toe box is WAY to narrow. I ordered a full size bigger like always and still narrow. I was pretty disappointed since the claim was a bigger, better toe box.",
110244,5,03/31/2017,"YES ! RUN LUCKY ! A gift to myself ! I was fortunate to get these shoes just in time for Tacoma's St. paddys day run & I received a 1st place in my age division ! Wearing them in a down pour of rain ! Then dryed them out overnight to run the Seattle St. Patrick's day dash the next day & received a 7th place in my age, truly special shoes !",
110244,5,03/29/2017,Great shoe Been buying this running show for a while and always will in the future. Great for running and general gym once. I took them out of the box and ran 6 miles and it felt great. Highly recommend,
110244,5,03/28/2017,"Super Sporty, Quick and Fast Feel Bought the Shamrock for St. Patty's Day run, Wow they were great. Now I also have the Koi version. Love to mix this shoe in with my other Brooks shoes",
110244,5,03/25/2017,"Love them. Waiting for new combos. Good fit, comfortable I am a Zumba and Bollywood instructor. They are light on my feet, great arch support.",
110244,5,03/24/2017,"Great running shoe The Brooks Launch is my go to distance running shoes.  I have tried other brands to include saucony, mizuno, Nike and new balance but I keep coming back to Brooks because of the fit, comfort and confidence to complete half marathons, marathons and triathlons in their shoes.",
110244,5,03/24/2017,St. PADDY's Day NOT St. PATTY's Day ,
110244,4,03/24/2017,"Comfortable shoe I ran the Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach on March 19th in these shoes. Besides the shoelaces coming untied (they have round rather than flat laces and I didn't double knot them at the start so it was my own fault), I really liked these shoes. I currently train mostly in Ghost 8s, but will probably switch to the Launch for road training.",
110244,4,03/23/2017,"Love, love, love! ",
110244,5,03/23/2017,"I would definitely recommend these running shoes! I use these primarily to run; however, I did wear them out for a pint or two on ""St. Paddy's Day""!",
110244,5,03/23/2017,Shamrock Green adds a little style to my stride. Great for road race training (5k to 1/2 Marathons).  Lace them and go.  Light weight and no discomfort experienced during any of these activities.  I purchased the limited green and they were a hit.  Got a lot of comments when we ran the Shamrock 8K in Virginia Beach.,
110244,4,03/22/2017,"Love the Shamrock Launch 4 I use this shoe as an everyday trainer.  It's durable, light weight, and comfortable for tempo and interval runs as well as long runs.",
110244,5,03/22/2017,"Awesome way to celebrate St Paddy's Day! Many comments about the stylish-ness of the St Patrick's Day Launch 4.  Very cool that Brooks made and released this shoe.  Keep up the pleasant surprises in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead.  Including all your gear designed to celebrate and recognize specific holidays.  Makes you very unique in a wide open field.",
110244,4,03/22/2017,"Awesome color!!  Great looking shoes I bought these because of the green and gold color, and they look amazing.  I wish they made these in wide width though, as I had to buy a half size bigger to get them to fit, and they're a little tight.",
110244,4,03/20/2017,"nice light weight trainer Nice shoe for recovery runs and easy training days. Could use a little more cushioning under the ball of the foot, for fore foot strikers.",
110244,1,03/16/2017,Half size shorter than Launch 3 ,
110244,5,03/09/2017,This is my second pair of Launch 4 and they are great! ,
110244,5,03/08/2017,I'm very happy about this shoe ! ,
110244,4,03/07/2017,"Great except one small area... I love this shoe as well as most brooks products but the this shoe gets slightly wider or has excess right at the ball of the foot along each side. I can tighten it down and it works, no pain or problems yet. It seems fine for now and hopefully will continue to be a great shoe!",
110244,5,03/05/2017,"3rd pair Favorite running shoes, nice level of cushion, but can feel a little squishy if your doing sharp turns constantly. Otherwise they are great long distance runners. My last pair were the custom Tokyo printed ones, and they had a different material that was less comfortable and breathable then the regular color patterns.",
110244,5,03/05/2017,Superb! ,
110244,5,03/05/2017,"Excellent shoe Launch 4 is a major advance on the previous versions. I've had several pairs of each of the predecessors, and in terms of comfort, fit, and sheer run-ability, this is clearly the best. It seems optimally lightweight and cushioned.",
110244,5,03/04/2017,"Love Them! Lot's of compliments on the styling! Overall they just feel great on my feet, no discomfort on the treadmill or elliptical. Once again Brooks are best for my feet. Thanks!",
110244,4,03/03/2017,Best running shoe I've ever had most comfortable run ever ,
110244,5,03/03/2017,Yes I wear these for teaching PE and coaching track.  Very comfortable shoe.  I like the added loop in the tongue to keep the tongue from sliding to the side.,
110244,5,03/03/2017,"Launch 4 definitely an improvement over earlier series Loved the old Launch 2 and this is an improvement in every way, lighter and more responsive for sure. I'm coming from a Ghost, and much prefer the feel of the Launch 4. Like a dummy, I went out and ran 10k in them right out of the box and didn't get a single blister (your experience may vary). Love this shoe",
110244,5,03/01/2017,"Don't understand the low-star reviews... Not sure what the deal is with all the poor reviews. This shoe is not narrow, it actually has a very roomy and comfortable toe box. Of course your feet will get wet walking through dewy grass, the shoe is vented for breathability.... It's a running shoe.. Very responsive, perfectly cushioned if you run correctly with correct form. I use these (and the launch 3s) for everything from long runs, longer interval and tempo workouts and even on race day (anything longer than 10k). Durable, easily get 350-450 miles out of them. If you're looking for a maximally cushioned shoe, you haven't done your research and bought the wrong shoe. That's your fault. Not the maker's.",
110244,5,03/01/2017,"Fantastic Shoe Very comfortable shoe... For the right person. The mesh fabric makes it so your feet feel a breeze as you run which is amazing IMO. But if you run on trails or dew drenched grass, these won't be for you. The heel is also super springy so it's great for people with normal running mechanics. They are super lightweight and comfortable. Would buy again",
110244,5,03/01/2017,Wonderful Lightweight and great cushion !!!! I have the 3's and love them so got the 4's and ran a Marathon and were great !!,
110244,4,03/01/2017,"This shoe has its place. And it's on my foot. I run in the Launch and it was made for my foot. I find on runs less than 12km, they're great - light weight, responsive, and super comfortable. If they go further, I get a little foot fatigue. Also, if training for a half or beyond, I change over to the Ravenna. Seems there are some folks who don't like the shoe. Fair enough. Lots of people don't like Syrah, but that doesn't make it any less delicious.",
110244,5,02/27/2017,"Don't be mislead by those negative reviews The two negative reviews appear somewhat unfair.  The one reviewer is basically complaining that the mesh on the upper is breathable, which is an intentional feature that most runners appreciate. Besides, how many runners are planning to run through a wet front yard? The other reviewer complained about a lack of support, although this shoe intentionally tones down the cushion so that it is faster, lighter and more responsive. It also sounds like they were too small or narrow for him, and that is just an issue of fit, which says nothing of the shoe's quality. For me, this shoe provides more support from the minimalist shoes to which I was accustomed, and it still manages to be lightweight, quick and responsive. In fact, I have had a number of nagging pains in my lower legs which have dissipated after two weeks of running in these shoes. I have tried other cushioned neutral shoes to help with my nagging pain, but they have always proven to clunky and slow. With the Brooks Launch 4, I have found a wonderful compromise between a support and speed, which is exactly what I have been searching for!  I am extremely happy with these shoes, and they quickly became my new ""go-to"". I will be buying these again...and again.",
110244,5,02/27/2017,"So far, Best Shoe for Longer Daily Running So for Brooks shoes, these have me thinking of trying Brooks more often. Went to a specialty running store to see if I could find a shoe that was nicer to my Achilles' tendons. The trainer and I went for a run around the area and he gauged my stride and running. When we got back he suggested a ""flatter"" and lighter shoe. Tried these on, went for a run, then tried some saucony and Nike shoes. Came back to these. Even pressure across the bottom of the shoe when hitting the ground. Was very cushioned. So between this and 5 other shoes, these came home. I don't actually like the designs of Brooks shoes, but these are too comfy to deny.",
110244,1,02/12/2017,"Like wearing nothing at all - but thats bad Sadly I was hoping for a + experience when a running store said their employees tend to choose the Launch for races. After just three miles I would have told you what I knew as if I was water boarded. Tight, too small, and transmits every pounding step - and I barely weigh 150! Stay away if you value your joints.",
110244,1,02/10/2017,"Launch I wouldn't own another pair of these if they were free and you paid the shipping! I couldn't walk across the front lawn in the morning without my feet being drenched, socks and feet saturated, what a wonderful way to start off. They're way to tight in the front. And just all around a lousy shoe/sneaker",
110244,5,01/17/2017,"Great Shoe Great shoes.  I held off buying the Launch 3, waited for the 4's as the press was they would be as supportive as the 3's, lighter, and more flexible.  Guess what- they are lighter by a touch, more flexible, and just as comfortable!  I love these shoes, would recommend them to anyone that is like me- 58, run around 20 to 24 miles/week mostly on the road.  I have a slight bunion on my right foot, and these shoes fit in a way that does not put any extra pressure on the problem spot- that is a big deal for me.  Also like the oval laces.  The blue ones look great- I'm really happy!",
110245,5,11/22/2017,"Very good shoes After more than 100 km, I can say that I really love this shoes, confortable and fit for my large hard-to-shoes feet.",
110245,4,11/06/2017,"Good cushion, a little tight in the toe box. I like the over all comfort. I can get some good mileage out of them. It's a little tight  in the toe box but, the biggest gripe I have is that a ton of rocks get stuck in the bottom! #ReviewSweeps",
110245,5,08/11/2017,"Fit, Feel, & Spring (and durable, too) I've put over 300-miles on these shoes. They've been durable and show expected signs of wear. I anticipate I can keep using them until 400 miles. My typical run is 12 miles: about 8 on pavement & 4 on trails. These shoes are best suited for the pavement but give me adequate traction on the urban dirt trails I use regularly. I like the spring in my step, the comfortable toe box (particularly compared to the tightness of the toe box in my Ghost 9s.), and the feel beneath my feet. The Neuro 2 gives me both padding and a feel of what is beneath my feet. When I hit a small rock at the edge of the road, I know its size and dimensions BUT the padding protects me from injury. This road feel is helpful on the uneven surface of the trail, allowing me to adapt quickly. I will be replacing my ""teal tigers"" with another pair of Neuros before the end of the month.",
110245,5,06/20/2017,Yes I will buy again. Love the shoes.   Wasn't sure but once they changed them up I knew this would be one of my go to pair to run in.,
110245,5,06/15/2017,"I need to purchase another pair before this version is gone! First, let me just say that these shoes are great - period. Second, they're my second pair of Brooks (I've used the PureGrit4s since May 2016) and they really confirmed my brand loyalty. Third, they are SO comfortable. It feels like you're running on pillows but with the responsiveness of running on a waffle-like free sole. Fourth, they are sexy as hell. I get lots of stares as I run along the malecón in Lima, with everyone's eyes focused on my feet.",
110245,4,04/04/2017,"Soft and cushy, smoother landing than edition 1. I'm liking these so far, not an everyday shoe for me, but they're still good.",
110245,5,03/31/2017,"...and twice on Sunday! much improved from last year!  Kudos on style points, as well.  Bio-mechanically very sound.",
110246,5,12/26/2017,Another Great Pair!! ,
110246,4,12/19/2017,"Comfortable and lightweight These are great shoes for running IF you have good arch support and ankle mobility.  If not, I recommend using for walking or other light aerobic activity.  These are my favorite shoes for non-training activities.",
110246,3,11/26/2017,"Heel counter ruins it I try the shoes at a local store and at first it feels comfortable. However, after several miles of using it, the heel counter is annoying especially during casual walking. It is somehow sharp at the edge which will dig into the back of your foot  with any slight movement. Walking into it causes so much distraction since the heel counters keep on rubbing my foot. Not to the extend of blistering, but just sheer annoyance. Running over 50 miles in it does not help either.",
110246,5,11/17/2017,"Slight flaw, but still good Bought this shoe for short distance running and walking/travelling. I have a wide forefoot but unfortunately this does not come in 2E width. Wearing normally in size 9, i have to go half a size larger. Size 9 feels quite restrictive in the toe box while size 9.5 feels slightly larger but more comfortable. I am ok with the roomier toe box since the lacing can secure the heel snugly. The only slight flaw to me is that the 3D fit print does somehow hold the fore-mid foot too snugly but not the whole mid foot (feels unbalanced). It would be nice if it can secure the whole mid foot, or just eliminate it overall.",
110246,4,11/10/2017,"Comfortable shoes I use these shoes as my day-to day ""walking shoes"". I work in a setting where I'm on my feet most of the day on concrete..The only complaint I have about them is they are starting to smell quickly (my running other shoes don't stink nearly as bad)",
110246,5,11/02/2017,Super comfortable and cool shoes! I bought these as my everyday walking shoes. They are very light weight and comfortable. I love the look!,
110246,5,11/02/2017,Super comfortable and cool shoes!!! I bought these for my everyday walking around shoes. They fit great. They are very light weight and comfortable. I love how they look!,
110246,5,10/30/2017,"My favorite shoes I run 25 miles+ each week, and I love the PureCadence shoes. I've been running with Brooks for many years, and I started using the PureCadence shoes when they first released, and I've been hooked ever since.  I overpronate and the stability of the shoe really helps.  Super comfortable.  I can easily sit back and enjoy a half- or full-marathon with these shoes.#ReviewSweeps",
110246,5,10/27/2017,My feet are happy to be back in Brooks. ,
110246,5,10/24/2017,"Converted Me to Brooks These are the first pair of Brooks that I've owned!Pure Cadence 6 is a great blend of minimalist, light weight, low drop, yet comfortable cushioning.  It replaces a brand/model that I've used for years, yet has gradually moved away from what the Pure Cadence 6 offers.  The toe box doesn't have seams to rub toes and can conform to the foot like a sock.  I like that the toe box fabric isn't thick like some knitted shoes are.  Not to be taken for granted, it is an extremely stylish shoe compared to many other minimalist shoes.  I've gravitated toward colors other than black, but my local running store only carried black.  I loved the shoe so much I purchased it anyway.  After seeing the grey model online, I'll definitely be buying a pair of grey too.  Love the shoe and can't wait to log miles on them.",
110246,5,10/18/2017,Thrilled These shoes fit perfectly and look great. I ordered a second pair in another color for everyday wear.,

Thankfully, Brooks got the message and the PC 6 doesn't disappoint.  Fantastic low-profile, plush ride with just enough support for my flat-ish feet!  I dig the new grey color, too.  Not gonna lie, I still miss the full wrap band that was present on v.1-4 and don't love the new tongue design (can dig into the foot break), but I'm still happy as a clam with these shoes.  go BROOKS!",
110246,5,10/07/2017,"Best Brooks shoes yet! Running already in the Transcend 4, decided to take a chance with the Purr Cadence 6. These shoes feel great! Very little break-in period required. Like the 4mm drop as it seems to work good with my flat feet.. I have never said a shoe was ""fast"" before, but this one is!! Been switching between the Transcend for slower runs and the Cadence 6 for my speed workouts and longer runs.. I run between 30-40 miles a week.. Hopedully Brooks won't change a thing about this model..",
110246,5,10/05/2017,I would buy this product again. I do a combination of walking and running about 40 miles per week.  This shoe feels great and gives me just enough support to enjoy my workout without applying too much stress to my feet.,
110246,5,10/05/2017,Big fan of Brooks I like how the strings stay tight when lacing up. Not too tight. Same for the rest of the shoe. Stays tight while running but not too tight,
110246,5,09/22/2017,"Awesome!! Don't change a thing! This is by far the best update yet! As soon as I put them on, I could feel they were special. I was concerned that I wouldn't have time to break them in before my first Ironman (Maryland Oct 7) but after running a 20 miler in them, I felt great. They are coming to Maryland with me!",

I have around 150 miles on my new pair over the last 3 weeks and can tell things are all good again. I have 3 age group wins and 2 age group 2cd places in full marathon and thought my age competitive days were gone. Brooks, thanks for listening to the PC5 comments and making corrections. At 61 years old not sure how many more marathons I have left but want them to be as good as possible and the PC6 will give me a chance to accomplish that.",

Fit was good with out of the box.  Not much ""break in time needed"" I personally found.  Felt good all around, no tight spots and blister areas for me.  Good secure fit around the heel and very stable in that area as well, this keeps the foot strike transition smooth I find.  I like the light weight and lower profile forefoot for speeder workouts.  I was worried about the soft knit like material around the toe box (I usually find my big or little toe end up wearing through my runners at these spots) but with well over 400 miles of running on these puppies there is no damage yet, mainly just wear to the outer sole.  The knit material seems to be actually supple.  I was very impressed with the durability and fit I just ordered a second pair.",
110246,5,08/10/2017,Best Pure Candence yet I've owned several versions of the pure cadence since they came out and this maybe the best one yet.,
110246,5,07/30/2017,Excellent shoe for running and every day use Absolutely the best shoe I've ever owned.  I can't find them anywhere except online.,
110246,4,07/12/2017,"Brooks has done it again! I skipped the Purecadence 5 from  all the negative reviews. I have been hoarding my last pair of purecadence 4's and I am very relieved that the 6 is an improvement. Out the box, perfect balance of cushion and responsiveness. I am amazed that it still feels like a split toe design. Thanks for taking comments into consideration.",
110246,5,07/10/2017,Would purchase again ,
110246,4,07/02/2017,"I think that I may have finally found my shoe Because I'm an overpronator with low to flat arches, I've always been guided by running store employees or charts on websites to shoes like the Brooks Adrenaline or Beast and similar Asics products.  Since I wear a size 14, those shoes were heavy and clunky.While on one of the sites to do a comparison of Brooks shoes, the Pure Cadence showed up as a ""Stability 3"" shoe while the others were 5.  However, I thought I'd take a chance even though the others were touted to be more conducive for overpronation. I'm so glad that I did.  The PC6 shoes feel so much lighter on my feet and are extremely comfortable.  Better yet, I've taken one minute per mile off of my run time.The only reason I'm not giving this product 5 stars right now is that I want to see how long they last.  Running every other day, if I can get 4 to 6 months of wear, an additional star will be in order.",
110246,5,06/30/2017,Best Cadence since the original I run on side walks and streets. This shoe is the best pair of brooks I have had since the origanal cadence. I was about to switch to another brand and decided to give brooks another try. I am ordering a second pair to have when these wear out.,
110246,5,06/26/2017,"As expected, excellent! This is my first pair of true running shoes.  I've been running off and on for years and have always just used a pair of cross trainer shoes.  It's a whole new world with these Brooks shoes!  What I noticed right off was how much room my toes had that they were not sore after a long (10+ mile) run.  I also really like the minimized drop from heel to toe.  That has helped me concentrate more on better form.  The online process to recommend a shoe size was spot on -- I had reservations of going 1 full size larger than what I normally wear, but the recommended size is perfect.  I will definitely buys Brooks again and looking forward to trying out the other models!",
110246,4,06/23/2017,"Another good performing PureCadence I've put about 60 miles on them so far. The toe box is roomy, good support throughout, and the tongue doesn't seem to curl up like the previous models. Overall a win!",
110246,5,06/15/2017,"A great, comfortable shoes One of just a few shows on the market that actually fits my foot comfortably",
110246,1,06/10/2017,"Fit is not same PureCadence 1 - 4 First of all, I am big brooks shoes fan. Purecadence 2 and 3 are my most favorite shoes of all time. This version 6 feels narrow, bit more stiff, less cushioned, no arch support and basically fits nothing like the earlier versions 1-4 (didn't try version 5). I even recommended to other people. I wish Brooks had kept the same fit as earlier version 1-4. Unfortunately, I will have to look elsewhere for now.",
110246,5,05/30/2017,"best walking / workout shoes I've ever, ever had!!! as I got older, trouble with my arthritic knees.  These are absolutely superb - stable, solid, comfortable, perfect corrections for my knees.",
110246,5,05/25/2017,"Great upgrade from the PureCadence 4 I run a lot, doing multiple marathons and trail ultras throughout the year. I wore the heck out of my PureCadence 4's- 2 marathons, a 50 miler and a 100k, and in all sorts of weather, never once did I get a blister. I was sad to retire them and worried about finding a shoe that could live up to that performance. These 6's rock- they feel more responsive, I get a little more splay for my toes, and I love the breathability and stretch to the upper. It's like wearing a comfort shoe that I can go fast in.",
110246,5,05/14/2017,This shoe pretty much saved my life! Zero pain wearing them. ,
110246,5,05/11/2017,"Great running shoes! Very light weight, comfortable and stylish running shoe! I'm actually thinking about ordering a second pair for everyday use since they're so comfortable.",
110246,5,04/27/2017,"Cozy I have average to slightly narrow feet with near freakishly long toes... so maybe atypical, but these fit perfectly.  This is my second pair of PureCadence (previous was a v3). They really promote good form, but if you haven't run in a 4mm drop shoe, work the miles up carefully.  You will definitely feel your calf muscles working much more than in a 12-13mm shoe.",
110246,5,04/19/2017,"Back to goodness! I love this shoe! I had the Pure Cadence 3 and 4 and loved them. The 5 was terrible, as noted by many reviews. Brooks went back to something similar to the 4, and it is great. Feels a tad heavier than the 4, but I also feel more support than the 4, which is a plus. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this shoe. Will probably get another pair, as I suspect it will wear fast (300-400miles).",
110246,5,04/18/2017,I will buy this product again. ,
110246,5,04/14/2017,"Pure cadence This is my second pair, I love them, they are the only pair of shoes I can go to work in !",
110246,5,04/12/2017,Very comfortable. ,
110246,4,03/31/2017,"Light and natural Comments on the fit and size...I measure 10.5D and wear this for most other brands.  The PureCadence 10.5D fit good for length, I found it slightly narrow in the forefoot but the upper material is flexible and doesn't constrict or cause discomfort (this concerns me over time with developing a hole by my big toe).Running with them...They have a great feel under the mid/forefoot, creating a soft and natural landing.  Light feeling and breathable material upper.  I like the wide stable heel outsole.  The laces are stretchy and tongue is slim but padded which makes it secure and comfy.  Ankle very secure with no odd rubbing.",
110246,5,03/28/2017,"I love these shoes! Love these shoes, everything I expected them to be.  Comfortable right out of the box, lightweight, supportive and cushioned enough.  They look great and feel great while running.",
110246,5,03/27/2017,"PureCadence returns to its roots This shoe is an improved version of PureCadence 4 and the earlier versions, very comfortable and natural feel for a minimalist shoe. I tried PureCadence 5 twice and it was",
110246,5,03/27/2017,"Part of your skin I've only been wearing for about a month. So I wasn't able to rate on some categories like durability and such. What I can say is, right out of the box these shoes sleeve on and wear like a well broken in shoe. True to most Brooks shoes they feel like part of your skin on first wear. They are lightweight and very responsive. They provide support in the appropriate places for me and with my mixed running terrains, they have not disappointed in their ability to provide me with a comfortable ride:) I run in the range of 30-40 miles per week. This is my second per of this model, but first of this generation. I will keep buying until they disappoint...which I hope is never:) Highly recommend.",
110246,5,03/19/2017,"Light, fast, fits like a sock Great for shorter, faster runs (for me, that's 3-5 miles). The sole has some soft materials that probably won't stand up to much abuse, and the upper is extremely lightweight and breathable, so good for speed but not for rain or durability.",
110246,4,03/19/2017,"Thank you for the upgrades and the grey/green color option! Brooks is my brand. After switching through all the usual suspects, I have become a 'Brooks or nothing' shoe buyer. Great support, comfortable, and decent looking (Really dig the subdued grey color). Looking forward to the next year with these and my Pureflow5's...  Cheers!",
110246,3,03/18/2017,"Bad Pair? My last 3 pairs of running shoes have been Brooks and Ive loved them. This is the first pair I bought online for using the tool that helps you choose the right shoes for your stride, etc. one of the options was the PureCadence which is what my other 2 pair were so I ordered them. After my first 4 mile run, my left knee swelled up and was a little sore. Put a little ice on it, some ibuprofen and the next day it felt fine. Two days later I ran another 4 miles and when finished my knee was again swollen and extremely sore. Its been 2 weeks now and I still cant walk without a limp. Im sure its the shoes...just not sure what is different?",
110246,4,03/16/2017,"Best version since the original. My favorite PureCadence was the original. That was a revolutionary shoe, at least to someone like me who had run in Adrenalines for years. Loved the low drop and light weight. After a couple of misses, the 4 was a return to form. I skipped the 5 after so many poor reviews...and am now loving the 6. It is very much like the 4, but even more comfortable. The redesigned upper is the main reason. My only complaint is one that remains from the 4 -- the stretchy laces are hard to get tight, and can come untied. Bottom line...if you liked the 4, get the 6.",
110246,5,03/14/2017,"You listened and it worked! Finally!  As everyone has noted PC5 was a disaster and 4 wasn't much better.  Everything that was wrong with PC5 has been corrected.  Tongue does not cut into your foot, overall material is light weight and is very flexible, no more cutting at the toe and the shoe is back to the softer ride of the PC1,2 and 3.  While I only have about 25 miles on these the fit, feel, control and comfort is what I would have expected.  I've used all the models up to 4 to run 1/2 marathons and I think these will be my first for a full marathon.  They are a bit heavier but honestly, they are best I have found, and I've tried a lot of shoes, even for the weight.  Anything in the 9 oz area, with some pronation support, will work. I suspect these will last about 250-300 miles, depending on usage and honestly, at this price, i'm ok with that mileage.  Hopefully mid-year you will introduce some other colors, but that won't stop me from stocking up on these.  Congrats Brooks!",
110246,4,03/14/2017,"Very Good Had the PureCadence 4 and loved them.  The reviews for the 5's scared me off but decided to pick up a pair of the 6's.  I typically wear a size 10 in Brooks and ordered the same which were a half a size too big, so you may want to size down a half a size.  Overall they are super comfy and responsive.  I use these more for speed work and racing.  I don't have a ton of miles on them so I can't speak to durability but as far as comfort I would rate them up there with the 4's.",
110246,4,03/12/2017,"Significantly improved upper on the new PureCadence I absolutely love the redesigned upper on the PureCadence 6. The mesh '3D Print' upper fits comfortably, as promised, and provides a lightweight but supportive feel. Brooks has fixed the sliding tongue issue that detracted from the previous two iterations of the line by adding a lace loop to the new tongue; this is an important fix because it helps maintain a comfortable fit even during long runs. I've put about 50 miles on my pair, and the only complaint I have is that the sole seems a bit stiff. I've worn them around the house and running errands over the past week or so, and that, combined with the 60 miles I've put on them, seems to be softening the soles up a bit.",
110246,4,03/07/2017,So far so good Different style from what I am used to. I followed the recommendation of the web site. So far I am very pleased with the choice,
110246,5,03/04/2017,"Definitely going to stock up Bought these as my old pureflow's were running pretty thin.  I put them on around the house and immediately fell in love with them.  There were just the right amount of supportive, lightweight, and responsive.  Took for a little 10K run and they were a dream.  I love the upper material, it's soft and flexible.  I hardly ever run more than 10 miles at a time so the cushioning is just right.",
110246,4,03/03/2017,"Not as light as I'd expected. I thought it was going to be 8.9 oz as mentioned, but actually was 9.5 oz. Noticeable difference. I probably should have gone with Pure Flow or Launch 4. Still like the shoe. Probably won't race with it as I'd planned.",
110246,5,02/21/2017,"Excellence! I own 3 pairs of PureCadence 4's, my favorite shoes until now, and 1 pair of 5's, which took a while to get used to and have used on longer runs over 10 miles - but not nearly great as the 4's. My first pair of the new PureCadence 6's arrived in time for my business trip to South Florida, and there was literally no break-in period needed while logging over 20 miles during the course of the trip. The 6's are as good and even better than the 4's with improved breathability and feel lighter.  Thank you Brooks for listening and addressing customer concerns with the 5 model.  I will be buying at least another pair of 6's shortly. So glad I won't need to hunt for a new brand.",
110246,5,02/16/2017,"Fantastic Shoe! I ordered this pair of Pure Cascade 6's two days ago and they were here waiting for me when I got home from work. A+ on the two day shipping!Upon putting the shoes on I was immediately very impressed with the fit. The sizing was accurate to my normal 10.5. The tongue is very comfortable and did not slip at all while running. The toe box is spacious and the material is very comfortable and breathable. Today was a cold and very windy day and I noticed that I never felt the elements through the shoe while also breathing very well. The best part of the fit is by far the heel. I never felt it slip one time and it cups the heel very well. My only complaint is that the midsole was stiffer than I had expected. I'm a 6' 200lbs runner and it still felt a little stiff to me, forefoot was very responsive. Overall ride was great and the weight is fantastic. Great shoe!",
110246,5,02/15/2017,"I have owned 9 pairs of the PureCadence models. I love 6! Thank you Brooks!!! I have owned 9 PureCadence models. I loved 1, 3 and 4. Did not like 2 or 5. I read several reviews on the 5's after I bought them and saw I wasn't alone in my feelings about them. I am very happy with the 6's so far. Very comfortable, like the 1 and 4. I got the red/ black and it came with 2 sets of strings. Red and black. Thanks again Brooks!",
110246,5,02/14/2017,"Back to Good! I've worn the purecadence line in all my marathons for several years now. It's a must-have shoe for me. All other lightweight options give me several blisters, while this fits like a glove. The purecadence 5 however was a mess! Where the tongue meets the toebox had a serious flaw that dug into the top of your foot. I wore them once and after I bled all over them, I was done. So, I was nervously/anxiously awaiting the arrival of the purecadence 6 and I am elated to announce they're back to the best lightweight shoe in the industry. Everything wrong about the 5 was fixed on this edition. I am happy and relieved that I don't have to scour the Internet buying up all remaining 4s now!",
110246,5,02/10/2017,Exactly what I expected I've run in PureCadence since they were released and just got the 6 last week and it did not disappoint!  I love the fit and how light they are.  Not sure about the other color - but the Red/Black shoe came with 2 laces (Red and Black) - so I guess if you aren't keen on the Red you can switch.,
110247,4,12/21/2017,Good overall shoe ,
110247,5,12/20/2017,All around good running shoe ,
110247,5,12/19/2017,"Military Member These shoes are wonderful. They provide the support I was looking for. True to the size that I bought it for. I'm 6'1, 195 lb. Great shoe!",
110247,5,12/19/2017,I will continue to buy pure flow and only pure flow I wear them for running and for everyday use. The best shoe I have ever owned. I only wear Brooks pure flow.,
110247,5,12/18/2017,"Running on it is a dream I have owned a Pureflow 2 before this and tried replacing it with a Pureflow 5 about 18 mos back. It did not work. But, Pureflow 6 has been absolutely magical. The cushioning enables you to have a great run with less stress on your feet and knees. Highly recommend it !!",
110247,5,12/17/2017,"I bought 3 pairs because the first was so good Lots of treadmill and trail running. Never run on pavement. Live in Alaska, shoes a bit cold in winter",

110247,5,11/15/2017,Best shoe I've ever run in by far!! The Pure Flow has been my road shoe since the first version came out a few years ago and this shoe and the Pure Grit are the only shoes I run in.Heard rumors that the Pure line is going to be discontinued and all I can say is ..............  please tell me it's not true.,
110247,5,11/08/2017,"Great road runner, the only road shoe I'll buy! I use these as my goto running shoe and can say after trying many different brands and styles that this is hands down my favorite and best preforming runner. I typically run to stay in shape and clear my mind and typically do around 20-25miles a week. I loved these because they had a lower heel to toe drop and less cushioning than some other runners I had used in the past, so they felt more natural and speed oriented. With that being said, once you approach the 250mile mark you should be looking into getting another pair. I replace mine every 6 months or so and have been doing so since the pureflow 4s.",
110247,3,11/07/2017,Brooks for Life I know my 3 star review is in a little bit of a conflict with my Headline.  Fit and feel of this shoe is as good as any Brooks shoe I have run in in the past (which has been many).  The reason for the 3 Stars is the tread pattern.  The deep tread recess is an absolute rock magnet anytime I come across gravel or a chipped up road.  I have had to retire these as runners after about 5 miles.  They are now my indoor work shoes.  I get lots of positive comments on the look.,
110247,4,11/03/2017,"Very comfortable and lghtweight I have about 60 miles on this shoe. Typically run 4-6 miles for training runs.  I wanted something smaller profile and lighter than the Glycerines that I was wearing previously.  I did a huge no-no and ran a 10K race the day after I got them and loved how they felt.  I had zero issues during the race, no blisters or discomfort.  Took about 2 runs to feel like they were broken in.  Shoe is true to size for me.  They appear to be holding up well.",
110247,5,11/02/2017,"MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE EVER! I've been running for over 10 years and have gone through a lot of shoes and these are, by far, the most comfortable and stylish ones yet. Brooks has surpassed Nike as my new favorite shoes!",
110247,5,11/01/2017,"Each update gets better! I wasn't a fan of the Flow the first time it came out, but I love the updates, especially the last 2. They fit my feet perfectly, are light weight but perfect amount of cushion for me.",
110247,5,10/31/2017,Great shoes I love that they are relatively lightweight and durable. I have used them for distances up to marathon and have had zero issues. I keep a pair in my shoe rotation. Also love the locked in feel around the heel. Feels more stable than other shoes I have tried.,
110247,5,10/30/2017,I've bought these shoes for the last 3 years These are the best running shoes I have owned for the last 3 years. Since I started running in them I haven't switched. Great support for medium to high arches. 10/10 would recommend,
110247,4,10/28/2017,I like the shoe light weight and supportive ,
110247,5,10/23/2017,These are the best PureFlows ever! I I run with these on my treadmill. They are simply awesome! I have owned many pairs of PureFlows and these are the best! Thanks to reviews I avoided PureFlow 5!,
110247,1,10/18/2017,"Caused Injury I have been running in the Brooks Pure line since they were launched. I've tried them ALL and was happy with all off the expect the Pure Drift 2. My favorite in the series was the Pure Connect 2, I think I ran through 4 pairs of them. The shoe felt perfect in everyway for my foot. So I think I have a good feel for this line of shoe. First run in this shoe was okay, felt at par to the PureFlow 5, I was really didnt expect that much from them. I can say after 5 weeks I've developed a foot injury, If I try and run in the morning I can barely put pressure on my right foot(lead foot), and it takes until midday for the pain to subside. This has never happened to me in 9 years of running. I will have to abandon them. I will have to move from the Pure line to something different sadly!",
110247,5,10/14/2017,I'm addicted to this Brand ,
110247,5,10/13/2017,"Great quality, reasonably priced shoe I use this shoe as an everyday trainer, and it is probably my favorite shoe model I have ever run in. It is reasonably priced for being a high quality running shoe, has nice bounce and cushion, and feels responsive on your feet. The only complaint that I have is that rocks get stuck in the soles of the shoes very easily, which can be annoying. #ReviewSweeps",
110247,5,10/13/2017,Saved My Marathon I was having lower foot issues with my previous shoe that was not a Brooks product as I enjoyed the PF3s but not the 4&5s.  Those issue have went away in the few weeks I've had the PF6s.,
110247,4,10/12/2017,"Awesome Shoe... but... I'm only giving 4 stars because I haven't run the complete lifespan of the shoe yet (AND another reason I'll mention later), and have no measure of durability... that said, the shoe seems to be well crafted, comfortable (nice toe box room) and durable enough to withstand significant training. Comfortable straight from the box, and a fair amount of cushioning, but not too much in my opinion. The ""drop"" feels about right... not minimal, but certainly headed in the direction.***Now, as others have mentioned... the engineers laid an egg on the shoe's base design (not materials, but design). If there's any gravel, or random pebble within 20 feet of these shoes, they will find their way into the bottom and wedge deep, sometimes enough to jam into the foot. The usual, and occasional scrap to dislodge the pebbles is rarely enough to get rid of them... the vast majority of the time, the only way those pebbles are coming out is to stop and dig them out with a car key or stick. That sucks... and needs to be fixed if I'm to continue with this otherwise AWESOME shoe.",
110247,4,09/25/2017,Pretty Good Except for the rip I like it overall. It is really comfortable and gets rid of shin splints that I used to get all the time. Unfortunately I was on my 4th run with these shoes and i tripped and it scraped up the toe and the shoe ripped in two places very minorly but still a tear!,
110247,5,09/25/2017,I love this shoe. This is my second pair of the PureFlow. I bought the original pair a size higher than what I usually buy. I while liked that shoe I wasn't completely sold but I suspected that the size was the issue. I bought the second pair in my normal size and fell in love with them on the first run. They offer great cushioning and don't feel heavy. I used them on runs as long as 20 miles.,
110247,5,09/21/2017,"Absolutely love these shoes, changed my will to run I used to run in a pair of lightweight New Balance's, and decided to try Brooks as I was experiencing pain in knees and shins when running.  These shoes were just as light but provided enough cushioning to make the fun feel much better.  I would highly recommend to anyone interested in testing Brooks to make the jump, I will not be buying another brand for a while.",
110247,5,09/20/2017,Im a big fan! ,
110247,5,09/18/2017,"PureFlow 6 doesn't disappoint! I am the proud owner of the PureFlow's...from the 1 to the 4's, I loved running in my PureFlows.  There was too many changes and poor reviews about the PureFlow 5's, so I skipped that version.  I was praying that Brooks got their groove back with the PureFlow 6 and...I was NOT disappointed!  Extremely comfortable and stylish.  Thanks Brooks!  Might have to grab another color scheme if they go on sale!",
110247,4,09/15/2017,Very nice shoe ,
110247,4,09/12/2017,"Great for logging road miles I have run in many iterations of the Brooks PureFlow and this is my favorite one yet. The shoe has good support while still allowing you to feel the ground underfoot, which I like. It also has a wide toe box. As someone who has blown through many a toe box after just a month or two, I really appreciate the extra space there. It's also a well built shoe more generally, and will definitely give you many hard miles without breaking down too quickly.",
110247,5,09/12/2017,I will be purchasing this shoe in the future. Use the shoe for marathon training / races averaging 50 + miles per week.  Very comfortable light weight shoe.,

110247,3,08/28/2017,"Little disappointed in this product. I was excited for the shoe to come in but when I tried on when in home a couple of times, the insole comes out each time!  This does not feel like it should do this.  I am actually in the process of sending the shoes back.",
110247,5,08/28/2017,Brooks Pure Flow are my go to Running Shoes  ! I've been using this line of shoe for over 5 years and thousands of miles without injury. Its light and well balanced with new designs and colors added every year.,
110247,4,08/25/2017,"The almost perfect shoe Pros: Minimal, low drop, fits amazingly- like a sockCons: I'm surprised no one else seems to have this issue: I live in the city of Chicago. I run in a concrete jungle. However, without fail, every run I will find the handful of rocks in the city and they will become stuck/lodged in the deep treads of the shoe. It's a small but fatal problem due to its maddening nature: the *click*click*click*click as you run that compels you to stop to remove the rocks.",
110247,5,08/25/2017,Best shoe I've run in thus far. Light but durable!!! This is my third consecutive pair of Pure Flows and I love them. Can get 500-550 miles on them also.,
110247,5,08/23/2017,"Another great version of a great shoe I think I have ran in every version of the Pure Flows.  Great training shoe that could be used for racing as well.  I'm a mid-foot striker and this shoe has plenty of cushion.  I'm 6', 182 and I regurally get 450ish miles out of them.  Overall, great shoe.",
110247,5,08/22/2017,"Please never change this shoe... Lightweight, very soft ride, without being too cushioned. These shoes fit perfectly and feel great during my runs. Nice wide toe box on the normal width too. Please don't change these ever!! You can count me in for 2 pairs per year :)",
110247,5,08/02/2017,"Best PureProject shoe ever I've been a devotee of the PureProject line for years, and this is far and away the best model ever. Problems in other models, and in previous iterations of the PureFlow - especially the problem of being too narrow - have been solved here.I've run everything in these from rocky desert trail 30Ks to paved city-street half-marathons to the Bataan Memorial Death March Marathon in White Sands, NM, and maybe finished hurting pretty much everywhere else, but not my feet! Have also put this shoe on a lot of my best XC runners, and they've all made the same assessment - It's their favorite distance shoe.Note to Brooks: PLEASE don't change this shoe!!",
110247,5,07/31/2017,Great Shoe I bought the dark grey shoe for traveling.  It works great for my runs and I can clean them up to wear around town.,

110247,4,07/20/2017,"Great Shoe With 1 Problem I love all of the pure line, I've worn PureGrits, PureConnects, PureCadences, and these and they are by far my absolute favorite shoe out of all of them but, there are indentes on the outsole so that it can bend more naturally but this also creates a space for small rocks to get stuck, weigh you down, and hurt your feet. Overall an amazing shoe with only 1 downside.",
110247,5,07/12/2017,Look No Further Excellent light running shoe that conforms to the shape of my foot and style of my run. I was loyal to nike for years but I will never look back. My PureFlow 6 shoes will absolutely be a repeat by. I recommend trying a Brooks shoe on in store before buying but you absolutely get your money's worth.,
110247,1,07/05/2017,"I would not buy this product again There is definitely something wrong with the left shoe. Something hard underneath the sole on the outside of the heel and for whatever reason, my big toe is falling asleep in the same shoe. Not impressed",

110247,2,06/07/2017,"Not Okay in OK I tried so hard to make these work for my street/track running shoe as I used to love the Pure line of shoes. This shoe had everything I look for, but the width in the toe box is just too much. If you have a narrow foot, this shoe is not for you; unless you like sliding off the sole with every turn.",

110247,2,05/24/2017,"Sad to see pure flow getting worse I'm really sad this shoe keeps changing.  They had such a good thing going up until version 4, I skipped 5 because the reviews were so bad and was excited when I saw how great the reviews are for version 6.  But I'm not happy with this shoe at all.  The good things about the shoe are it's lightweight and flexible but I'm finding the cushioning to be off from the version 4 and the arch support to be lacking.  I'm getting major calf pain now which had never happened.  I tested a worn pair of version 4s and the calf pain was gone leading me to believe it is the shoe change.  Now I'm frantically trying to see if there is a version 4 anywhere or if I should just purchase another style at this point.  grrrr go back to what worked and stop changing this shoe.  I was such a die hard fan!",
110247,5,05/18/2017,"Restored Faith in Brooks For years I used Pureconnect line and was very disappointed when they discontinued! Pureflow 5's came out and seemed comfortable except for the rigid tongue that cut into ankle.These shoes may have restored my faith in Brooks. Fit like a glove. Just enough cushioning and a great outsole pattern. First 10K run was so comfortable I went and bought a 2nd pair to set aside! After pureconnects were discontinued I tried some Nike and Altra shoes, but these will definitely be my go to training and race shoes! Hopefully future models will see only minor tweaks and not mess up a good thing!",
110247,5,05/15/2017,"An excellent training shoe. Good for long runs or marathons. I loved the Pure Flow II, one of my all time favorite running shoes. I did not like the IV, and the V was unwearable ( way too narrow ). I have bunions, so unstructured, wide toe box is essential for me. Also, the Flow provides adequate cushioning without being soft. I have a pair of Saucony Freedoms, a $160.00 shoe, but I prefer the Flow VI which is much less expensive. The Freedom is way too soft underfoot. The Flow VI is closer to the Flow II than the others. I like the shoe a lot, and will probably buy 3 or more additional pair before they are ""upgraded"". Upgrading often means destroying something that is already good.",
110247,5,05/13/2017,I would but this product again. ,
110247,5,05/05/2017,"So far, so good! I'm coming from a Brooks Beast 15 upon which I put nearly 600 miles. I'm a big fan of Brooks so far. The Pureflow 6 was recommended to me by Brooks' own website and I thought I'd give it a try. The first thing I noticed about this shoe is it seems much lighter all around. It's all soft above the sole which feels really nice. I took it out for its first real test this morning and got a PR by more than 30s/mile. They felt great! They felt responsive and comfortable, nicely springy. Overall they were a super pleasant ride. I do have some concern about the durability. I had a pair of Brooks Ghost 8s before my Beasts which only lasted about 300 miles. These shoes feel so light and soft I'm worried they won't hold up. If I can get 300-500 miles of good performance out of them the 5-star rating will stand. I'll update a little further down the road.",
110247,5,05/02/2017,"Simply put, this is the best running shoe I've ever worn. Again, this running shoe is the best I've ever worn is my 50-plus years of running.  I was introduced to your product fairly recently, and I will now wear nothing else.",
110247,1,05/01/2017,A great shoe that fell apart I bought this shoe with high expectations. There were others out there at half the cost but this shoe was so comfortable. 4 days after buying the shows the soles started to come unglued. Highly disappointed.,
110247,5,04/24/2017,Great Running Shoe! These shoes are very comfortable and fit my feet perfectly! Like all Brooks I've worn they're great for running on trails or around the neighborhood and I'm sure will last me quite some time,
110247,4,04/18/2017,My Fourth Pair of PureFlow Model These sneakers are perfect with the exception of the fact that it takes a few runs to break them in. I don't recommend wearing them on a long run the first time.,
110247,5,04/16/2017,Recommended for runners of all experience levels This is the first real running shoe I've ever owned. Previously I have just been using Nike Roshe Runs which are not really running shoes. I was experiencing bad shin splints and as soon as I started running in these all my problems disappeared and now I can run everyday of the week pain free and happy! These shoes have everything you could ask for in a running shoe!,
110247,2,04/14/2017,"disappointed I run 25-28 miles per week on road surfaces. They seem to be wearing better than the Pure Flow 4, but not nearly as comfortable. There is more foot movement in the Pure Flow 6 from the 4 because they eliminated the strap in the 6. The shoe is heavier than advertised. I did not purchase the Pure Flow 5 because of negative reviews. Would not buy another pair of 6.",
110247,4,04/13/2017,"Stay Calm and always choose Pureflow! I've owned almost every version of the Pure Flow's. Although they rip at the top after about a year, I easily put 300-500 miles on every pair so not unexpected. I tried to recently switch just to try something new - bought Nike Freerun flyknight - most comfortable shoe I've ever tried on...BUT my heals were killing me instantly. Switched back to Brooks and found immediate comfort. Bought 6's week before latest marathon and rocked it - no issues! And I love the color options this go around.",
110247,5,04/13/2017,"An improvement over the PureFlow 5 I wear Brooks at work as I am on concrete ALL day, their shoes have been a real lifesaver for me! My previous shoe was the PureFlow 5, the PureFlow 6's are sleeker, quieter and more refined. Adding the tongue slit for the laces to go through was a nice add, my PureFlow 5's didn't have the slit and the tongues would always slide over, irritating... I'm liking these a lot!",
110247,3,04/13/2017,solid shoe ,
110247,5,04/11/2017,"Feels better than the PureFlow 1 This shoe feels a lot like the first version of this shoe, which is a great thing for me. It's updated with new technology, but fits like the original. I normally wear an 11 in Brooks, but a size 10.5 fits perfect in this shoe.",
110247,3,04/05/2017,"I would not buy this shoe again The shoe looks great. The cushioning on the heel is great, and it really hugs your heel. The tongue is soft and has a little cushion, which I like, but it's not bulky or too lite; just right. The cushioning was stiff with not much give, but it's supposed to make you feel connected to the road instead of thick and bouncy. It seemed like a really phenomenal quality shoe, and the material appeared quality and durable. My issue with this shoe was the insert, which was raised to high in the arch. I think the designers meant it to be for high arch people, but it dug into my arch. It also made me feel like my foot was sliding toward the inside as I walked around in them. Finally, they suggested I buy a 1/2 size larger, which was wrong. I'm normally at 12.5, so I bought 13s. They fit great, but there was too much room at the end of the toe. I ended up purchasing 12.5 shoes, and they fit perfectly.",

110247,4,04/03/2017,"Excellent ride Great, light weight minimalist shoe.  As a 6'4"", 215 pound runner I wore cushioned shoes for years and thinking back I believe these contributed to a lack of flexibility in my feet and  a very nasty case of plantar fasciitis.  Switched to the Pureflow and the pf cleared up in a month of daily wear and I am back running again.",
110247,4,03/28/2017,Great fit and looks good! ,
110247,5,03/28/2017,"Glad to be be back... I have run in Brook's Pure line for years, a couple years ago when I couldn't get Connect's, I opted to try a change.  I found some Hoka's that weighed the same, offered a firmer ride than other Hoka's.  I personally do not like soft, sloppy shoes.  Long story short, I hated those shoes!  Glad to see these when I decided to check in again.  Like a long lost friend when I put them on and went for a run.  I don't usually have a lot of too narrow, too wide complaining and have always run in an 11.  I would get an 11.5 next time.  Not hitting the end of toes and causing any issues, but they are close.",
110247,5,03/23/2017,"The shoe I love is back The shoe I love is back, slowly lost it in the PureFlow 4 and the 5 was a complete disaster.If Brooks would bring back the burrito tongue it would be a grand slam",
110247,5,03/23/2017,"Marathon run I've been a continuous buyer of the Brooks PureFlow, including the PF 2,3,4 and now PF6.  Used the PF6 recently for my sixth marathon.  Broke them in with a 13- and 10-mile trainings prior to the race.  In my 13-mile training, the shoes felt more rigid than the PF4, but they seemed better in the 10-mile training.  Was concerned how they would be in the marathon, but they were great.  No blisters and no other side effects on my legs or knees.  The sole is definitely more sturdy than previous models, which I think is a benefit.  It looks like it is going to hold up longer without any drawback on cushioning.  Ran a great race so I'm very pleased!",
110247,4,03/19/2017,"Pureflow is back to basics ! I have been using the Pureflow since the launch of the Pureflow 1. I have ran in the PF 1, 2, and 3 and still found the PF 1 better. The PF 4 and 5 I avoided after reading the reviews. I decided to try the PF 6 based on the reviews. I am very happy to say that these are pretty close to the feel of the Pureflow 1. I am a men's size 9 and for me these run true to size in all aspects. One of the major issues I have been encountering across the board is that the sizes are being cut small and more narrow, but not these ! The PF 6 are light weight, cushy but not sloppy, and have a pretty decent rebound response. I purchased the Denim Blue ones and I love the color and design my only gripes are they are not that ventilated and the material creased right below where the laces begin only after 2 runs. (see pic)Overall for the money they are a good running sneaker !",
110247,1,03/14/2017,"DisPureConnect Overall the Pureflow feels like a shoe that is trying too hard to be something for everyone. What I think has happened is a philosophical and structural problem that has the runner sort of running in two different worlds and never getting to the ""flow"" of the run. First, the expansive world of PureFlow hangs on in the design. It tries to provide the cloud inspired base of its former self - lots of cushion - forcing the runner to ride high in the sky, ""floating"" rather than ""flowing"". Secondly, the minimalist world of PureConnect never lets the runner get to the connection of the run because of a midsole/arch region design change that is so markedly different from the Connect to start causing shoe induced pain at about mile eight + ... that has you back-off from tempo disallowing the connect. The slight added flare-out on the medial and lateral aspect of the heel with faux rounding of that same area to make it appear that the heel can find its place instead subtly plants the heel in a controlled position thus preventing freedom of motion of the heel that you felt with the true rounded heel of the now extinct PureConnect... An opposite feeling of Flow. The new PureFlow is good for the runner looking for some control but it has created a disconnect for the PureConnect connect-with-the-run runner. In other words there was truly enough of a wonderful difference between the two shoes to warrant continued R&D with design evolution and improvements for both of these neutral classified running shoes. Back at the birth of the Pure series I tried out the PureFlow and returned it because of its bulky high ride controlled feel (my impression) and exchanged it for the PureConnect... I wish it was possible to do this again.  Thank you Brooks for all your dedication to running and runners... and for reading what is shared. I am open to finding something else in the Brooks line of running shoes... any suggestions?",
110247,5,03/13/2017,"The Flow is BACK! I had given up on the entire Pure Line after the Flow 4's completely changed.  I loved the 1's, loved the 2's even more, and the 3's were close to both the 1's and 2's.  But the 4's were a totally different shoe and the 5's were a joke.FINALLY, the 6's remind me very much of a combination of the 2's and 3's.  Look forward to lots of runs in these.  I will say that there is a small change to the sole that rocks your foot towards toe-off.  Kinda cool, but not sure how that will affect people.",
110247,5,03/12/2017,"Best PureFlow Shoe Yet I have been wearing Brooks since PureConnect2, and have been wearing PureFlow since PureConnect was discontinued. (I skipped PureFlow 5's given the bad reviews). After two awesome weeks of running in these, I can say these are the best PureFlows yet. Here is why I like these so much:--The seamless fabric prevents rubbing points on upper foot.--Even/flat sole tread on bottom gives balanced contact with ground. Very good since I underpronate. Tread also seems like it will last longer than previous models.--Slightly stretchy fabric gives an excellent fit all around the foot. --Toebox seems slightly wider (I have a slightly wide forefoot).--Sole is more rigid. Gives more of a spring when pushing off. ""DNA"" sole offers excellent cushion with optimal balance upon contact.--Still has a great lightweight/minimalist shoe feel.If you are looking for low toedrop, lightweight/minimalist, mid-or-forefoot striker shoe with cushion, these are for you. If you are a seasoned PureFlow user who was disappointed in PureFlow 4/5, your favorite shoe is back and better than ever. I highly recommend.",

I was disappointed with the Pureflow5, but the 6 seems to be everything I wanted in a ""run workout"" shoe. They are reasonably lightweight, responsive, roomy toebox, with just enough cushion. I like the 4mm drop too. Well done Brooks....*** Just wished they lasted longer, but maybe this new style sole will?",
110247,5,03/04/2017,Would buy again! Bought this shoes as a gift after reading others reviews. He absolutely loves them and can't stop talking about how comfortable and lighyweight they are. He needed a neutral shoe and this shoe was a prefect fit.,
110247,3,03/03/2017,Not as advertised I usually run outdoors on asphalt. My Brooks Glycerin and Ghost 7 are much better for me.,
110247,3,03/03/2017,"Miss the old days of the Flow The cushioning is good, but I miss how the Flow used to actually feel like a more minimal shoe (lower profile, overall). Good improvement from last model, though, making a more roomy toebox!",

And then the PureFlow 5's were a step backwards.However - the PureFlow 6's are a step closer to the PureConnect feel and while they aren't identical - I've almost forgotten. In fact, don't tell my PureConnects since I bought 4 extra pairs, but there are things I may like better about the PF6's!! They feel slightly more responsive on ground impact and so far I like the different tread feel. I will also say that while I ordered the same size (9.5) - they feel about a half size too big - but I like the extra toe space/width in the end.Brooks - I was | this close | to changing brands... you've saved me - for now ;)",
110247,2,02/04/2017,"First pair I've had to return I have been a Pure Flow loyalist since the first edition, going through multiple pairs a year. Last year i skipped the 5 because of negative reviews but was able to find a couple pair of 3's to get by. I decided to try again this year and was highly disappointed. From the first run, I could tell something was different. I could fell something digging into bottom of my foot under my metatarsal heads. I tried them several more times with no improvement. I pulled the insole out and noticed that it is made differently. There are grooves in it that allow for flexion of the insole and this created a crease that was causing my discomfort. I hate to send them back because I have traditionally loved the Pure Flow. Fortunately, I have found a pair of 4's. The first build of the shoe was the best in my opinion.",
110247,5,01/20/2017,"The Pure Flow is BACK! I wore both Pure Flow 2 and Pure Flow 3 and loved them.  V4 broke down very quickly and I never bothered with V5 because of the locked down upper.I have been anxiously awaiting the release of V6 and am so excited to go for a run in these bad boys.  They fit perfectly and have the minimal feel I am looking for in a running shoe.  If you want a lot of cushion underfoot, this is not your shoe... you are supposed to feel connected to the surface you are running on and this shoe is perfect in that respect.  Wearing them today, running in them tomorrow.  Can't wait!",
110247,5,01/18/2017,"Thank you, Brooks Running! Thank you, Brooks Running, for bringing my favorite shoe back to its proper feel!

110247,4,01/12/2017,"Nice update, the Flow is relevant again! I have been a loyalist to the Pure line since inception in October 2011 and have worn all versions of the retired Connect and Flows with the exception of the Flow 5.  I have put a lot of miles on the shoes from short mileage runs up through a 50k.  The Flow has definitely shifted in the direction of the Connect by being less bulky and less cushioned than earlier versions, however as was apparent with reviews of version 5, the upper became problematic and I never experienced that version.  Based on that version, it seemed questionable if Brooks would release another version and I was hopeful when the release date was announced.  Verdict: The Flow is back!  The upper fits beautifully and is extremely pleasant to wear.  However, the upper falls a bit on the less breathable side of the scale, but it is tolerable considering the great fit, performance and style.  The shoe is wonderfully flexible and seems to perform best as you pick up the pace and make it work.  I would like to see just a touch more cushion in the forefoot while maintaining the 4mm drop.  Overall this is a great performing and aesthetically pleasing shoe.  Nice job Brooks on an outstanding update and for creating what might be the best Flow yet!",

110248,3,11/02/2017,"Great running feel but questionable durability I love the Ravenna. I've had over 20 pairs dating back to Ravenna 3s. The Ravenna 8s definitely have a durability issue with the upper mesh as this is the second pair that has started to tear. The first pair had less than 200 miles and looked terrible! Multiple tears in the upper mesh. After sending a note to Brooks customer service, they kindly sent me a replacement pair which I very much appreciated. However, the replacement pair started to tear around the 200 mile mark and has continued to get worse. Obviously a design flaw or poor choice of material. Either way, I'm disappointed that my shoes look so poor after minimal wear.",

I normally wear a 12 or 12.5, and the 12 in these seemed okay length wise, maybe a 1/2 size large at best, but the width is super slim. I can feel the sole pushing into the outside of my feet. I'm hoping it compresses with use. I would not buy again, unless they widen the shoe, and make it a touch smaller length wise.",

110248,4,09/04/2017,Solid shoe I am training for a marathon in November and was recommended by a friend to get a pair of Brooks. I have always been a Nike guy because I have a narrow foot and they seem to run narrow. That is really my only knock on these brooks is they don't seem to run as narrow as other shoes I had. I picked these after doing the online questionnaire to find the right pair for what I was doing. I probably should have gone into a store and had them look at my feet so that's on me not Brooks.,
110248,5,08/25/2017,"Good shoe for Flat Feet Due to my flat feet I have to use very hard inserts.  This shoe does very well accommodating my insert.  However, due to the width of my insert, the shoes does get damaged fairly quickly.",
110248,4,08/18/2017,I like them! ,
110248,4,08/17/2017,"Struggled with IT band issues The shoe seemed comfortable and fit well but after several runs, I learned I need a bit more support and stability.  I'm starting to get IT band issues frequently which weren't a problem with my previous pair of shoes.  I hoped to get adjusted, but things are not improving nearly halfway through marathon training.  Thankfully, Brooks has a 90 day trial so I can return it and exchange it with the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17.  Hopefully that pair will give me the support and stability I need.  I'm sure other runners looking for a neutral shoe who do not need as much support and stability might like this shoe.",
110248,1,07/27/2017,"Not typical of Ravenna series Have gone through several Ravenna model shoes, starting with the 4's. The 8's feel much narrower than past version. The back of the shoe has more padding and hugs my ankle more than I would like. The top sides, next to where you insert your foot had rubbed holes within one month - I am not hard on the shoes, it shouldn't have happened. The foot support is different as well. I have had shin splints, and had the bottoms of my feet get sore on short runs where that had never happened before with the Ravenna 7's. These are a waste of money. I hope the next version resolves these issues.",
110248,4,07/04/2017,Need more shoe choices for wide shoes. I wear these out in about two months.  Would like more choices for wide shoes I have a closet full of double colored shoes.   I like the Ravanna shoes but am open to try another shoe,
110248,2,06/15/2017,"Skip this version (8) of the Ravenna This is my third pair of the Ravenna series, though the other two have been previous models. The previous pairs lasted for well over a year. The fit was better. With the 8, the width feels significantly more narrow. Not a problem - just order the wider version, except they only released that in one color option. My biggest issue is the wear of the shoe. The stitching is coming apart in several places on both shoes. The cloth along the top side by the ankle has worn to the point their is a hole. I have not been hard on the shoes - they have seen light use. Quality, or at least quality control, has slipped on the Ravenna 8. I have owned the shoes for 4 months. Can't recommend this version - look for older ones if you can find it.",
110248,5,06/15/2017,I would buy this product again. I have found the right shoe for me for training.  I am able to run without knee pain during or after running.,
110248,3,05/31/2017,"Loved the shoe, but......... I have returned the shoes. Too tight(narrow) and unfortunately does not come in a larger width.",
110248,5,05/09/2017,Will buy again! Train for about 6 local 5K and 3.5 mile races. Best shoes I've worn in nearly 40 years of racing!,
110248,5,05/06/2017,"excellent shoe Great updates! Lots of room in the forefoot and toe box area. Have some big toe arthritis and a neuroma, this has plenty of room there. Feels and fits great! True to size! Great tempo, every day and racing shoe for someone with really flat feet.",
110248,5,04/28/2017,Very happy with fit and comfort. ,
110248,4,04/20/2017,"Reliable shoe I run about 20 miles per week and train for half marathons. I have tried comparable shoes by other companies, but this one fits my feet better. I wear an insert on right shoe for pronation (loose ankle problem) and it works fine. The more I run the more of a Brooks rat I am becoming--lots of quality products.",
110248,5,04/16/2017,"Thank you Brooks It's like someone 3D mapped my foot and made me a shoe. I'm confused by the comments that the run big. I'm forever a solid size 9 2E in most every brand including Brooks. Had to go to a 9.5 in these...but in standard width. The good news is not being limited to one blue/grey shoe colour. I don't wear orthotics, but they feel like they have the volume to accommodate them. For me they are a great balance of energy return: not too stiff, not marshmallow cushion. They perform better on gravel & moderate, dry trail than most other brands' road shoes. My only knock--as with all Brooks shoes--the laces are 2-3"" too short if you lace with heel lock.",
110248,2,04/13/2017,"Very disappointed in Ravenna 8. Had to return. I have  been a die hard Ravenna guy for 5 years. I have worn out 6 or 7 pairs of this shoe. It is the model I was fitted with when I started running. Since then I've run several half-marathons and two full marathons. I love the shoe!! Then came Revenna 8. I tried several runs, but the shoe hurt my foot (left) on the outside below my pinky toe. Seems the support in that area was different. I have been forced to find another shoe from another manufacturer. If changes are made to something like the Ravenna 4 or 6, I will happily come back to Brooks. Also, aesthetically, I don't like the shape of #8 either.",
110248,5,04/08/2017,Quality shoe These are my first Brooks and I'm impressed. Felt great right out of the box and still do after a month of running with them. I run on treadmills and on the road. I use to have foot pain when increasing my speed on road runs but not with this shoe. It has good cushion and feels like it smoothly propels you forward. I did have to by a size smaller and wider than I usually wear but that is the only con. Trying on the shoe first or the Brooks return policy as well as their selection of size and width options make it easy to find the shoe that fits best. I'm a health care professional that treats runners daily  and I feel that Brooks online assessment of what shoe will fit you best is spot on and the best I've seen. Overall switching to Brooks has been surprisingly easy and a great move that I should have made sooner.,
110248,2,04/06/2017,No soft ride Wore out several pairs of the Ravenna 7.  Enjoyed the 7's soft/plush ride.  The Ravenna 8 was so lacking in cushion that I switched shoes.,
110248,4,03/28/2017,"Overall good shoe, but a little tight in width I love the Brooks running shoes. I have stayed with an older model because I liked it so much. I thought I would try the new model and am ""OK"" with it. I wish the width was just a little wider due to the longer runs I have it feels a little tight toward the end. I will monitor the the wear as it I have ran about 60 miles so far and can't quiet tell the wear pattern yet.",
110248,4,03/25/2017,Would definitely buy again! I was promised a pair of socks with my order of shoes. I wqas told to place the order online & she would include socks. Never happened. In the last 3 weeks I've spent over $200 with Brooks. this has been my only disappointment with Broks.,
110248,3,03/22/2017,Good for price Shoe fits true to size. While the cushion is fine it feels very rigid after awhile and the impact doesn't seem to absorb very well. The arch support also is a little quirky for my taste as it seems to pull my foot outward. But traction is great and overall it's a great value for the money as a light trainer in my opinion.,
110248,4,03/22/2017,"Great Product - Sizing different Loved the Ravenna 6's, skipped the 7's bc the sizing seemed different, I like the 8's a lot however they seem to be made a half size bigger than previous Ravenna's. I normally wear a 10.5 but had to settle for a size 10 in the 8's.",
110248,4,03/07/2017,I would buy this product again I was looking for an alternative to Nike shoes which I have worn for a long time. I am very pleased with Brooks!,
110248,4,03/03/2017,"Ravenna are sized larger I would give 5 stars but im annoyed that their site sizing questionaire recommends size 10, our previous Brooks are size 10s, BUT Ravenna oversized. We had to return twice! First 10s then 9.5s. Finally 9's fit.",
110248,5,02/16/2017,Ran my first 10k! I completed my first 10k in a pair! I'm new to running and these felt fantastic.,
110248,5,02/13/2017,"best ravenna update I've ever worn I've been running with ravenna's for quite some time and this by far for me is the best update. Responsive and fast quick heel to toe transition as advertised with solid impact, just the right amount of cushioning during impact.",
110248,4,01/25/2017,"Turn back the clock I've been running in Ravennas since the 4th version and especially found Ravenna 5 to be the best.  Ravenna 6 had major issues with vertical height in the forefoot, causing a rubbing effect for me.  As a result, I totally skipped Ravenna 7 and ran in another brand. I decided to give the 8s a look and find them to be a good combination of cushion, stability, and energy return. The look and feel is much more like the 5th version, which is a plus. From a cushioning standpoint, I feel like it could use a tad more, but isn't too short on cushion. The sleek look and gloss of this model is not captured well in photos and they're very pleasing to the eye as well.",
110248,5,01/24/2017,"LOVE this shoe It's as if someone did a gait analysis, 3D mapped my foot, then made me a custom shoe. It is the perfect shoe FOR ME. I was a loyal Brooks wearer for 9 years. Then my Go To Shoe changed too much & I had to go to another brand. Now that shoe changed & my local specialty running store recommended the new Ravenna as an alternative. It does run a little short. I'm typically a solid size 9 and I had to go to a 9.5 in the Ravenna. Good for me though, because the toe box is roomier than appears in the photos. So with the half size bigger, I can wear the standard width and am not limited to just one colour offering for a change.Seriously. I want to buy 15 pair of these in all the colours so I don't have to think about shoes for another 4-5 years. It's the first pair of shoes I've really LOVED since the Adrenaline 11.",

110249,5,12/16/2017,"So far so good!! I purchased a pair of Transend, and Adrenaline GTS at the same time with the intention of keeping one. I ended up keeping both because they are both great shoes. I've worn the Beast in the past, but they were starting to get uncomfortable to me. I have to wear a couple different pairs throughout the week to workout or my feet will start bothering me. I am pretty much flat footed and so far these two shoes are working out great! Brooks makes great shoes!",
110249,2,11/28/2017,"Sore toes... The cushion was great and the overall fit seemed fine.  However, after only a few miles of running the top of the shoe would press against my upper foot and toes.  As a result, I developed blisters and small sores on the top of my toes (left foot).  Felt inside the shoe and a good deal of excess material remained where the tongue was attached to the upper.  May have also caused added pressure and irritation.  Not as much material in the right shoe.  May be a quality control issue.",
110249,2,11/28/2017,Not very comfortable There is a rough piece of stitching under the tongue of the shoe right where it bends that rubs the top of my foot on every toe off.  It actually started to draw blood and I needed to place a pad there even use the shoes.  Pretty frustrating considering the price of these shoes.,

110249,4,10/31/2017,Good for long shifts on your feet Very good shoe. I like these better than my Hoka One One. They provide a nice combination of cushion and support during long work shifts on my feet.,
110249,5,10/31/2017,"3rd pair of Trandcends I've owned the first, second, and now forth generation of the Trancend and I think this is the best one yet! Shoes are really comfortable for running. I've had many issues with an ankle and had surgery to repair it. This ankle is much weaker than my other and needs extra support, which the Trancend provides. Great shoe!",
110249,5,10/25/2017,Best Running Shoes I've Ever Owned Trained for and ran my first marathon (Marine Corps Marathon) with these shoes.  super soft and outstanding support.  I am prone to turning my ankles.... never turned when wearing these.,
110249,4,10/18/2017,"Better over Time I'm a marathon runner who is a little bigger than standard runners and I have bad knees so the comfort and soft cushion was a major selling point. I also need a shoe for stability/support - these all seemed to match.I did a couple small runs (3-6 miles) and things seemed fine - there is always an adjustment period. But after my first long run, I had bad shin splints. I was two weeks out from a marathon so I didn't want to change anything up but instead rested my legs to let them heal. The marathon went fine & although I still felt the shin splints slightly, they weren't bad. I normally get medium to high arch shoes and these are flat / medium so this is probably the cause.I also have never blistered with new shoes but these I did on both of my big toes. Very minor and not a big deal but something to note.",
110249,5,10/17/2017,"Excellent for Flat Feet! I have very flat feet and overpronate.  Running always gave me painful shin splints and weak feeling knees.  These shoes grip my feet so well and give me the stability I've been looking for.  I've tried Nike, New Balance, Asics, and more, always asking the recommendation from the store employee, but I've never felt anything like these.  I'm already breaking personal bests after just using them the first week.",
110249,5,10/13/2017,"Best shoes EVER! I ran my very first marathon in this model and still run marathons (full and 1/2) in these. They provide the much needed support and cushioning I require. Prior to these, I felt a great deal of pain and would have never imagined being able to complete marathons. These shoes assisted me in improving my 26.2 mile time by almost 23 min, in just 4 months! Please never stop producing these...unless there's a model improvement in the making.",

110249,5,09/04/2017,"The Enhancement Make the Running Experience. I was a bit unsure of the viability of enhancements added to the Transcend 4 at first.  While I knew the comfort and fit would be great, that was only half of the story.  The 3D Fit Print molded to my foot like a glove. It was also very breathable.  I was also surprised at how light the shoe was.  After the completion of my most recent 10K, my feet didn't hurt as the normally might when I'm trying to pound out the pace.   The T4's lighter wait felt like the experience of a ""connect"" shoe but with the an immense amount of cushion.  I was worried that it would be too much of cushion for me, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised.  Perhaps the best feature of T4's is the guide rails.  They helped correct my form to a more aligned and mechanically correct state.  The data backs up my claim.  Prior to using them, my Ground Contact Time % was about 49 and 51, depending on the shoes, terrain and my overall condition. Ever since I have been using the T4's (including the last two longer runs that I've done, the GCT% has been corrected to 49.8 and 50.2, consistently.  That is the best distribution that I've ever had.Bottom line....I love these shoes.  They are  a great addition to my arsenal and will definitely become my go-to shoes for longer road runs.",
110249,5,09/02/2017,"The best running shoes of the Transcend series yet I use these shoes on trails twice a week, asphalt path once a week, and on the treadmill and the versatile support the Transcend 4 provides keep my feet feeling fresh. Having moderately low arches, I've ran with the Beast and Addiction and would rate the Transcend 4 superior to any other shoes or brands. The Transcend 3 was a disappointment and this year's version is a nice comeback. Love these shoes!",

After spending 100's of dollars at the CP I decided to change my shoe and spend a little more money than I usually do on shoes. These shoes are worth every penny, no more back pain/hip pain. These shoes have fixed my over pronation that cause my hip pain, and the cushion is like walking on clouds.  I will be a brooks customer for life!!!",

I run about 15-20 miles per week on gravel roads and paved roads and the T4 gives me support and comfort on both surfaces. They are lightweight and supportive and comfortable and I like what Brooks has done!",
110249,1,06/16/2017,Badly miss the Transcend 3 The Transcend 4 seems cheaper and is in no way an improvement or continuation of the Transcend 3.  The toe box is narrower and the heel cushioning feels narrower too. My heel does not strike the ground evenly or as solidly and the feeling is that the cushioning is not as wide as it was on the 3 leading to less stability and more movement up to my knees.   Even the shoelaces are narrower.  After getting blisters on my toes and increased knee pain I returned the Transcend 4s and ordered a new pair of Transcend 3s from another seller.  The Transcend 3 was the absolute best shoe I ever ran in and I hope Brooks makes future versions of the shoe more like the 3 and less like the cheaper 4.,
110249,5,06/09/2017,"From Hoka Bondi to Transcend 4 This is my 1st ever pair of Brooks. I did the Air Force Marathon a few years ago with Asics Nimbus. Lots of cushion, but no real support. Since then I've been staying with neutral shoes such as my last pair from Hoka. I always had lateral foot pain on my left foot. Never did I think I probably need a more supportive shoe! Well, here comes Brooks Transcend 4 to the rescue. They feel super comfortable with a generous toe-box and are just about on par with my Bondi 4 shoes for cushion. But these actually give me the support I've been needing for years. A note about the toe-box, I have big toes that make holes in my socks and just destroyed my Nimbus shoes years ago. Since these have much more room and the upper isn't like a tight blanket on the front of my toes, I should be ok for many moons with these. I know I can't be the only one that has the big toe sticking up problem in the world right:) Bottom line, these shoes look and feel great. I may have to get a second pair before the Space Coast Marathon this November.",
110249,4,05/23/2017,"Very comfortable fit.  Provides great support I like the shoe with the exception of the color selections.  I purchased both color schemes offered and while I like them,  Brooks needs to offer this shoe in lighter colors also.  In Texas the black shoes are hot.",

I wish Brooks would market these shoes to non-runners! They are very good shoes for any person who might be aging and looking for some pronation control.",
110249,5,04/02/2017,These are the best of the four Transcend shoes. The cushion and fit are the best of the four Transcend shoes. I am an older runner and I need shoes that have a soft landing. I hope these shoes are not changed significantly in the future.,

110249,1,03/20/2017,"Very disappointed For roughly the last 10 years, I've been a dedicated consumer of this line of shoes - from the Trance 8 through 12, to the Transcend 1-3.  I've run pain-free and trouble-free...and am a total Brooks loyalist as the Trances & Transcends enabled my return to running after 15 years sidelined with Piriformis Syndrome and other sciatica-related issues.  However, this new Transcend 4 is awful.  Wore them for 6 weeks and have gone back to the old Trans 3's.  I felt like I was beat up after even a short 2-3 miles, knees, shins, and toes ached, and worst of all, the piriformis issues resurfaced for the first time in a long while.  After wearing the 3's, all the pains have disappeared.  Taking the 4's out of the box they felt flimsier, but other than that I have no idea why they've been such a disappointment.  I can only hope that this criticism resonates with the designers, and they improve the 5 next year.  For some context, I'm 58 years old, currently running 15 miles a week, and am just starting my training for the NYC Marathon now that the shoe situation is resolved.",

110249,5,03/10/2017,"The Search Is Over - Happy Camper So Far I'm 67 and slim. While always athletic, because of doctor's orders about 3 years ago, I've become a runner. Previously, I'd been a Nike fan because of their first-rate styling and for years I'd had no foot soreness or pain issues. But over the last three years, I've developed serious soreness in my heels and arches. I've self-diagnosed that as plantar f.  When I went to a running shoe store two years ago and had my arches/gait checked, I learned I had fairly high arches and am a moderate pronater. So the search began to find stability shoes. I got relief from the original Nike Odyssey but those have changed in the second version and weren't good for me. Neither did any other stability shoes I tried from Nike or New Balance. Recently, my research suggested I try the Transcend 4. Ordered online, they came five days ago. I've been wearing them practically non-stop during my waking hours and also in the gym. I'm totally in love (and can't believe I'm taking the time to write a shoe review). Incredibly comfortable out of the box. Great arch support. Great cushioning. For me, true to size all around. No pain whatever (and my many other recent running shoe experiments left me with soreness very quickly).  My only reservation (minor) is that I bought the blue/red version - an aesthetic stretch for me - but I'm happy to trade in aesthetics for my new pain-free feet. I'm eagerly looking forward to buying another color when they're available. Can't speak yet to durability though the shoe seems incredibly sturdy and well made. Bottom line: I'm now a huge Brooks Transcend 4 fan. A word to Brooks designers: Please don't tamper too much with this amazing winner of a shoe in future versions.  Thank you Brooks. I'm a convert.",
110249,4,03/03/2017,"Like the Shoe, Seems to run small Just purchased these after having the Transcend & Transcend 3 (which I love).

Unfortunately I need to return for another size.",
110249,5,02/27/2017,"The Transcend is BACK!! I loved the Transcend One, loved the Transcend Two even more, and then....came the Transcend Three, which was a huge disappointment.  When I received the Transcend Three, a very short initial run of three miles was extremely painful, so back to Brooks it went.So the Transcend Four is released, and with trepidation, I ordered a pair from Brooks.  Several days later, it arrived and I laced it up, planning on giving it a three mile test run, and honestly not hoping for much.  But three miles turned into four, which lengthened into five, and eventually ended at six.  Comfortable.  Pain Free.  Support.  For six miles.  Thank you Brooks!  The Transcend is back!!  I immediately ordered a second pair.  My first half marathon of the year is coming up soon, and I'll be running it wearing the Transcend Four.",
110249,5,01/23/2017,"I get what Run Happy means now I had recently been having more aches and pains in my knees and couldn't tell if it was old age or just a need to try something different. Age is something we can't defeat, but you can always trust your body when it is pushing you to try something new. You want to do anything possible to stay on the road and sometimes you have to trust your gut. I read a lot of rave reviews for the Transcend 3 from Brooks and decided to take the plunge and make a change after 8 years of wearing the Kayano series from Asics. I had tried on many other brands over the years and they were all disappointing compared to the Kayano. When I first tried on the Transcend, my exact thought was ""Wow!"" I immediately knew I was going to buy them. These shoes have been great right out of the box and they have been fantastic on both longer and shorter runs. First, the stability is exceptional in these shoes. Noticeably better than the Kayano that I was used to. I really like the fit on these shoes and the footbed is very well designed for the runner with a medium foot. They are light and I feel like I have some extra boost in these shoes. I am a relatively bigger runner (185 pounds with an athletic frame), so cushioning is something that I really put a premium on. I will admit that I thought nothing could top the plush ride I was used to on the Kayano, but Brooks has totally won me over. I feel there is actually better forefoot cushioning in the Transcend and the heel cushioning may actually be better as well. I feel that these shoes do a wonderful job with my overpronation and I have totally been blown away at how great of a job Brooks has done with making a true stability shoe with a super comfortable ride. Brooks, a tip of the hate to you on the Transcend 4. My aches and pains have been almost unnoticeable after 50 miles and I now totally get what it means to Run Happy.",
110251,5,12/20/2017,"A truly fantastic shoe. As a pro golf caddie on the PGA Tour you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who walks as many miles per day - other than the man standing next to me by the bag, of course.   Foot comfort, support and stability is essential to my livelihood. If my feet give way,  so too will my job. This shoe combines all of the above with top notch quality. The shoe lasts! I can't speak highly enough of the Beast. I've been wearing them for years. I'll continue to wear them.",
110251,1,11/18/2017,Smaller than other Beast shoes Purchased many Beast shoes and without a doubt this was at least 1/2 size too small.  Read somewhere recently that the Beast 16 was about 1/2 size smaller.  Would have been nice if Brooks had mentioned this since it seems to be relatively commonly noted before.,
110251,5,11/10/2017,Highly Reccomend ,
110251,5,10/27/2017,"great shoe in every regard, about to buy a second pair ",
110251,5,10/23/2017,"Great Pair of Horseshoes Great for stability, well cushioned, generously-sized toe box, and a good bet for us Clydesdales.",
110251,5,09/24/2017,"I would buy this product again. The Beast has the best foot support for me.  I tried all brands of shoes, but the Brooks Beast 16 is the most comfortable and provides excellent support.",
110251,5,08/31/2017,Best shoes ever! I have been run in the Beast over 20 years and would not ever sacrifice the fit. These shoes are worth every penny.,
110251,3,08/23/2017,"No Like Beast for years as a walking/running as well as casual shoe.  Worst cosmetic upper ever.   So boring.  Always trying to find on line old Beast 14.  Black with red trim.   Or come up with a midnight blue with silver.  Something, anything.  All Grey looks like old men's  shoe or orthopedic boot or something.   Got to do better.",
110251,5,08/08/2017,"Best Beast Yet The photo doesn't do this shoe justice--if you get a chance to hold it your hands, it's really beautifully made.  I've been running in the Beast since 2002 and I can honestly say Brooks has raised the bar this time.",
110251,5,07/13/2017,I would definitely buy this shoe again Very comfortable and supportive shoe. I'm glad I went with the recommendations and got a half size bigger. Good fit.,
110251,1,06/13/2017,Nevet ,
110251,5,05/12/2017,Super comfortable and supportive ,
110251,5,04/30/2017,The only running shoe I will ever use again. ,
110251,5,04/01/2017,Beast 16 LR ,
110251,2,03/29/2017,"Once There Was a Beast... What a shame that Brooks ""sold out"" on what was once a model shoe for overpronators! Cheaply constructed with the wrong shaped last and flimsy topped lateral side construction, the shoe is now just another loser.What do heavy, low-arched, overpronators want in a shoe?Answer: Superior pronation control, lots of cushion, and a straight last shoe!Is that so hard to accomplish Brooks?",
110251,2,03/22/2017,Not so good!! Don't like the flimsey shoe laces.  Harder to tie.  Shoes just don't feel as solid and secure as my previous Beast Running Shoes.  Having been buying them for the last 4 years.,
110251,5,03/22/2017,I wouldn't run without a pair of these ,
110251,4,03/19/2017,I would buy and recommend Brooks sneaker BUT I was having issues with heel spurs. I also have collapsing arches. I heard about Brooks and tried it out. My heels don't hurt anymore. The problem with my Brooks Adrenaline is the sole tends to wear away too fast. After 6 month the sole is separating. Also I noticed my sneakers don't smell well. I've never had a problem with stinky feet. I had to buy men's because the female version always come too narrow. There are women with XW feet. Other than that I am very pleased with my sneakers.,
110251,5,02/21/2017,"Finally great design with a supportive shoe! I have pain that comes with flat feet and over-pronation so I've been wearing the Brooks Addictions in all black as everyday shoes which have great motion control. However, the addictions and every other supportive shoe I've seen is just so ugly and has that ""grandpa"" look to it. I never found the Beast design attractive either, but this gray and white look is amazing. I think it's partially because of the white trim giving the illusion that the thick soles are not as large as they really are. Also there aren't crazy colors all over the place. Anyway I'm reviewing to thank Brooks and hope that they keep great designs like this in the future!",
110251,4,11/15/2016,"great shoe, but... This is my third pair of beasts.  Still have the other two.  They are so comfortable at first.  The problem I have experienced is that the insert that comes with the shoe starts to unravel way before the rest of the shoe shoes any wear.  Its a bummer.  I don't want to stop wearing the shoe, but the insert problem eventually make the shoe uncomfortable.",
110251,4,11/07/2016,"Great shoe, BUT.... I love this shoe. I have very flat feet so this is the best I've found for motion control. HOWEVER, the sole under the toe wears out VERY quickly. I do toe off when running and walking but this has been an ongoing problem with this model. Please fix it.",
110254,5,10/28/2017,Great running shoe. I have only used these shoes for around a month but they've performed flawlessly. They are very comfortable on pavement and the trail. The traction is great on rocky and loose sand terrain.,
110254,5,10/23/2017,14 was the day ,
110254,4,10/18/2017,Keeps me walking Color blue a little to bright. Fit a little tighter this time. Still the best sneaker on the market by far,
110254,5,09/18/2017,Excellent shoes ,
110254,5,08/29/2017,"Love these shoes! Great fit, comfort and stability. In my lifetime I have had dozens of pairs of running shoes and these are definitely the best ever. I used the online guide to figure out which shoes to buy and it was really helpful.",
110256,5,12/06/2017,Very comfortable Last year I ran in the Ghost 9 and decided to stick with the Ghost 10 GTX and have not been disappointed with its stability and comfort.,
110256,5,12/02/2017,"Excellent Not my first pair of Brooks and yes I'm purchasing another pair so I think they are excellent.  Went to a store for first pair and was fitted with correct size for me, important since it was bigger then I wear in dress shoes. They look great, wear well, are supportive and when out for the day no issue having them on for hours and hours.",
110256,5,12/02/2017,excellent ,
110256,5,11/10/2017,"Comfortable running shoes I don't run all that often, but these fit great, are comfortable and keep me dry when I'm running around my block after recent rains.",
110256,5,10/06/2017,"Amazing shoe for a temperate climate! #ReviewSweepsI have been a long-time Nike Free proponent.  I have relatively high arches and the Free line wasn't doing it for me anymore, so I took the Brooks online fit test and it recommended the Ghost line of shoes for me.  I couldn't be more pleased!  Living in Seattle, it only made even more sense to go with the Gore-Tex version of this shoe.  It is very breathable for being Gore-Tex.  The cushion and springiness of the the sole make the impact easier on my heels.  Until another shoe comes around to change my mind, I am going to continue to purchase this line of shoes.",
110256,4,09/15/2017,I would buy the product again Previous version seem a truer fit. Still like the new ones. Sizing seems a little looser,
110256,5,09/10/2017,"Whatever happened to wide? This review is for the Ghost 8.   I would gladly continue to buy the Ghost shoe but it is no longer made in wide widths.    Because of that, I need to go back to Asics and New Balance.   Too bad.",
110256,5,09/08/2017,Best shoe ever ,
110256,5,09/01/2017,Love the Ghost 10's I love the Brooks Ghost GTX line. The new Ghost 10's GTX are comfortable and fit perfectly. The overall construction of the shoe is built for both the recreational runner or the more serious runner.,
110256,5,08/24/2017,"I would buy this product again At the age of 70, I use this shoe for walking in all kinds of weather. The fit is ""spot on,"" the shoe is very comfortable and still stable (even at my weight of 220lbs).",
110257,5,12/27/2017,Great Got these for my husband as a gift. He has already run in them a few times and says they're awesome. He said they fit great and feel very comfortable and lightweight.,
110257,5,12/27/2017,I am really enjoying the shoes. Have two pairs will buy more ,
110257,3,12/24/2017,"Decent update Soles are very slick, tough to get traction on wet pavement. Lacing a little snug. But still great arch support.",
110257,5,12/23/2017,I like these shoes.  I will buy others ,
110257,5,12/22/2017,Most Comfortable shoe I've ever worn. I switched from Asics to Brooks and I couldn't be more happy.  This shoe is absolutely amazing.  The fit and feel is perfect.,
110257,5,12/21/2017,"Best Ghost Shoe Yet! I do more walking than running but no matter what I am doing, these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I have been a die hard Ghost fan for a number of years and this one is the most comfortable I have had. It still provides all the support and stability needed with extra comfort. Not sure how they do it but Brooks nailed it with this shoe for me. I need a neutral shoe so the Ghost series has always been my go to. There is new material inside which I thinks makes for the softer feel. No mesh as in previous but still breathable while out. Love this shoe and it looks great too!",
110257,5,12/21/2017,Highly Recommend for Wide Feet ,
110257,5,12/20/2017,Perfect neutral running shoe These shoes are the best running shoes I've owned to date. They are so comfortable and hug the feet perfectly. Such a great balance of comfort and adaptability as you run. You'll be tempted to wear them when you are not running too. The energy return is very good and it breathes well keeping the feet cool. Can't say enough good things about these. Looking forward to running in them again and again.,
110257,5,12/19/2017,"Amazing running shoe.  Best I've ever had. Great shoe.  Fits very well with plenty of cushioning. Never had any issues.  I've logged over 4,000 miles since my first pair -  Brooks Ghost 5,  I've had every model since then to the now Ghost 10.  Years ago I tried changing to a different brand probably because of the gimmicky marketing they were doing.  After two months and heel problems , I quickly came back the Brooks Ghost and those problems vanished.  Awesome shoe that allows me to thoroughly and absolutely enjoy running.  I have three pair that I typically rotate.",
110257,5,12/19/2017,Excellent shoes Very comfortable shoe with the right amount of cushion. I'm very pleased i purchased the shoes.,
110257,5,12/19/2017,"My First Pair of Brooks Bought 'em for the name, kept 'em because they ROCK!As a fan of all things horror, and searching for a new pair of running shoes anyway, the Ghost's name (and reputation) caught my eye and was just too good to pass up. It would've HAUNTED me if I hadn't at least given them a try. I mean, they look SPOOK-tacular. What? Are you BOO!-ing me? Okay, I'll stop.As for my review, the early results are based strictly on how they've performed during my 12-hour shifts at the hospital, running around the ER.  So are the Ghost 10's a great neutral trainer for my custom orthotics? Check. Is the DNA Foam in the midsole as comfy as advertised? Check. Is the toe box roomy and not pinched like some shoes (cough, cough, Nike Vomero, cough)? Check. Does it deliver on style? Sure, but it'd be kinda cool if Brooks considered adding a little ghost emoji on the tongue or heel of future models. Just a suggestion. Otherwise I'm very happy with them.",
110257,5,12/18/2017,Second pair. Great shoe ,
110257,5,12/18/2017,"Best shoes I have ever had! Best ever for me. I'm on my feet 10 hours a day on concrete and these are the most comfortable, but also durable!",
110257,5,12/17/2017,I will buy this product again I have plantar fasciitis and was told by my Dr. that I should buy a Brooks shoe best for this problem.  Bought the Ghost cause it was the only one in my size at ther store I went to. They have been awesome.  I bought a pair of the adrenaline hoping they would be as good but they are not. I'll be buying the Ghost from now on.,
110257,5,12/17/2017,"My favorite running shoe! I've been wearing this shoe model since the Ghost 7.  I tried another company's sneaker, hated it, and came right back to the Ghost 10.  Very happy.",

110257,1,12/14/2017,"Sad that I have to write a bad review I've used Brooks on and off for the past 8 years, and this is the first time I've been disappointed. At first they felt fine, but after having a few runs in I realized they caused a slight shift of angle on my foot and cramped in the middle. I should have stopped wearing them sooner as I have lots of pain. If you do order these, be sure to try them on in a store to see how they feel.",
110257,5,12/09/2017,"Vast Improvement Overall But Slightly Narrow These have the feel of the Ghost 6's and 7's - thank you!  Great call and getting rid of the overlay saddle; no more pinkie toe blisters - thanks again!  Had to go up to a 2E width from a D, but now that I know that we're back in business!",
110257,5,12/09/2017,light and comfortable ,
110257,5,12/07/2017,Bought as gift Bought these for my father in law as he needed some good shoes. He's extremely happy with them and loves them. Said so far so good!,

110257,3,12/04/2017,"Comfortable, poor product quality Constructed from poor quality. Have other pairs of brooks from previous yearAnd the ones that I bought this year are in worst condition than the ones that I got a couple of years ago",
110257,5,12/02/2017,"An awesome shoe After searching for a good pair of running shoes. I tried these out at a running store. They felt really good. I was very surprise because of the profile. You would not think this pair would be as comfortable as they are. Now I am a 5 ft 11' 235 lbs. I was just getting back into running. As being a huskier guy, I was nervous as you would think about more cushion but I couldn't stop thinking about these. Picked up a pair of these and I have not been happier. I you will enjoy these as much as I have. The only 2 minor things, there is a hot spot on one my shoes (could be from how I run) and in the heel there seems to be a weird unbalance (again could be from how I run). Overall, still going to get another pair.",
110257,5,12/01/2017,"Best Ghost Yet! I have been running in Ghosts for a few years now and have worn out a few pairs of Ghost 7s and 9s and am currently ordering my second pair of 10s. The 10s are the most comfortable Ghosts I have had (both out of the box and after many miles of break-in) and have also held up the best when compared to the other versions. I have averaged approximately 20-25 miles per week running over the last year and have about 400 miles of road and light trail use on my current 10s. The shiny plastic bit on the sides are worn looking and have lost their luster. The tread is showing signs of wear on the areas that I land and launch from. The amount of wear is consistent with the mileage. The upper has held up better than previous versions. I averaged about 350 miles with previous versions before the upper started to tear, the 10s are still holding strong. I am a large framed 240 lbs guy who runs on all surfaces and in all conditions. The traction has been great on the road and dry trail; however, it has slipped on wet and frozen ground (who would have guessed). These are my favorite running shoes hands down.",
110257,5,12/01/2017,Amazingly Comfortable Running Shoe I was looking for a new running shoe and after trying on 6 or 7 different running shoes the Brooks Ghost 10's were hands down the most comfortable shoe I put on! I have high arches and needed a neutral running shoe. Comfort was amazing and felt great spring from the fairly light shoe! Excited to put these to the test during my longer runs! I did have to go a half size bigger due to foot splay but even a half size up they felt amazing all the way around! I used to be a ASICS fan but Brooks just took that Title with ease!,
110257,5,11/30/2017,I would buy ths product again and again ,
110257,5,11/30/2017,Best Ghost to date! I get in about 20 miles per week and use them to work out in as well. Spend a lot of time wearing these shoes. Very comfortable.,
110257,5,11/29/2017,"Most comfortable running shoe I've owned From the second I first put the Ghost 10's on, I knew that it was going to be a wonderful running relationship. I've been wearing Ghosts for the last 4 or so years and the 10's are the best so far! I've found them comfortable on both short and long runs. I've also run on road and dirt surfaces and they're great on both. I like them so much that I purchased an additional 2 pairs.",
110257,5,11/29/2017,"These shoes hold my big heavy self Run on gravel or asphalt... very low impact .. supports my big heavy self.  I usually step hard on the outside of my heel, shoe holds it ground with me.. I'm a 260 lb dude.. I get compliments too on the red shoe..",

110257,4,11/20/2017,Amazing Shoe I strictly run in Brooks running shoes for the past 20 years.  by far the ghost 10 is my favorite of all their shoes. The only thing I didn't like about the shoe and it's kind of trivial was the limited edition  color looked good online but in person I don't like the color scheme . I am already going to order another pair in a different color,
110257,5,11/19/2017,Great shoe for helping me deal with my heal pain Brooks shoes were recommended to me several years as part of my therapy for plantar facia tendon inflation. Although I'm unable to enjoy running any longer these shoes help me maintain my walking routine.,

I've never had a pair fall apart on me, either.  Great shoes!",
110257,5,11/17/2017,Love Ghost! I used to always purchase the Adrenaline and the new designs weren't comfortable for my foot.  I decided to switch to the Ghost and couldn't be happier!  Very comfortable on my foot and it's true to it's size.  I will continue to buy Ghost.,

This pair is only a few months old and they are pulling apart on the right foot top edge just below my ankle. This is the third pair that this has happen to. Brooks replaced one pair for me a few years ago. But this pair only has a few miles on them and it has already started. You need to look into what is causing this to happen. I feel that it is happen to others also.  October 22, 2017 Brooks order 02437589 confirmation",

I'm preparing for the Richmond marathon and bought these to break in over the last month of training. Turns out they required little break-in time - were comfortable from the start, including a 20-miler two days after they arrived. Will definitely consider the Ghost 11 when they are available!",
110257,1,11/06/2017,10 is a disappointment I have been a Ghost fan since day one and 10 was a big disappointment.  The right of my right foot has been in close to putting 100 miles on these shoes.  I didn't want to make a change but almost forced to shop for another shoe.,

110257,5,11/02/2017,"Excellent (as expected) Been running with the Ghost lineup for several years now.  Absolutely LOVED the 9, and the 10 does not disappoint.  I guess there is a reason they are so popular.  I have always been the guy who is sucked into new and shiny shoes, but it just makes me recall how enjoyable runs have been with the Ghost's.  Kind of like that first VW Bug I had.  It just works.  Good job Brooks.  My only complaint would be that the shoe laces always seem to be about 2 inches to short.  No biggie, it allows me to get a flashy color of new laces.",

110257,5,10/31/2017,Best Yet Like the toe box and tread. Foot doesn't feel cramped. Better than the 9 more similar Tony favorite -#8.,
110257,5,10/30/2017,"Highly recommended This is is my second pair of shoes from Brooks and I can highly recommend to everyone who wants to run or runs a lot and expects high level of cushion with superb comfort. You & your feet will never suffer if you take these for 10k, 1/2M, M or more as this is exactly what Ghost 10 is designed for - long distance.",
110257,5,10/30/2017,"My New ""Go-To"" Training Shoe When my favorite training shoe came out in a new model that didn't work for me, I found myself in the market for a suitable replacement, and the Ghost 10 didn't disappoint.  In fact, this will be my new standard as the cushion is exactly what I need, yet it's light enough to not significantly impact my speed.  Plus, they look great.  I'm not sure if I'll race in these, as I do have a lighter pair of another brand for that purpose, but as far as my daily training, I'm not going to give up the Ghost.",
110257,4,10/29/2017,"Great Shoe! Great shoe for a neutral foot pattern. Breathable, comfortable and a bit on the lighter side.",
110257,2,10/28/2017,Not Impressed ,
110257,5,10/27/2017,Brooks are the Best! ,
110257,5,10/26/2017,"I'm sold on Brooks running shoes By far the best running shoe ive owned, i have wide feet so my selection is limited, ive tried many others brands, the Brooks Ghost 10s are by far my favorite",
110257,4,10/26/2017,"Another winner Got about 50 miles on the Ghost 10 LE and they are what I expect from Brooks - a well built shoe at the right price.  I read the reviews before buying.  Did a 10 miler right out of the box and I understand what they mean by ""springy"".  The only thing I would question is why brooks would put metal tipped laces on the LE?  They look cool but, bounce around why running, little annoying, easily fixed.",
110257,4,10/25/2017,"Ghost 10 toe box I had to return the regular width ghost 10 after a product change made the toe box a bit too wide and loose, but the 13b narrow show fits well. I wish the narrow sizes were available in multiple colors.",
110257,4,10/25/2017,"I like them, I would buy another pair of these shoes. ",
110257,5,10/24/2017,I tried the Ghost before and will continue buying These shoes are great for my planter fasciitis. The comfort and control of my high arches is great. Will buy over and over again.,
110257,5,10/23/2017,This is second pair of Ghost running shoes I have purchased. Mainly wear for work. Where I do a lot of walking and standing. Shoes are very comfortable and have great support. This is my second pair of Ghost's. Would definitely recommend.,
110257,3,10/23/2017,Like my previous models of Brooks shoes better ,
110257,5,10/23/2017,"Shoe so comfortable, I had to buy 2 pair. ",
110257,4,10/22/2017,I'm going to buy them again Running and every day use.  Most comfortable pair of shoesI have put my foot into,
110257,5,10/22/2017,"Nice change. I had bought multiple pairs of Defyance (which I also liked as a neutral shoe), but simply wanted a change with a ever so slightly lighter shoe.",
110257,5,10/21/2017,"Great Comfort consistent comfort,support and quality as I've ben buying the Ghost line for years. Would expect to pay more for the same with other brands.",
110257,5,10/21/2017,"Love it! This is the running shoe I have been waiting for all my life!  I have always been a fan of the Ghost line, but Brooks has nailed it on the 10.  The Ghost 10 maintains arch support and heel cushion and added a very lightweight feel to the shoe.  I wear a 9.5/men and there is no sliding at all from the shoe.  This is truly the perfect running shoe.  If there were one drawback, I'd say it's choices of colors.",
110257,5,10/19/2017,Best running shoes I've ever trained in! The shoes are very comfortable when I run and also good for walking. Great shoe overall.,
110257,5,10/19/2017,Very surprised how well the shoes feel while running in them ,
110257,4,10/19/2017,"Ghost 10 - better than ever (with a slight caveat) I've run through a dozen pair of Brooks Ghost shoes going back to the 5th generation. The Ghost 10s are the most comfortable, supportive, yet lightest feeling shoes yet. They're fantastic.**The Limited Edition version is a pretty big letdown. I absolutely love the look of the LE, but they have the thin/flat laces with heavy metal tips that seem to be a deal breaker.  During every single run, I've had to stop after 10 minutes to tighten my laces, which I've never had to do in any Ghost shoe over the years. The gold tips flap around a lot because the laces are soooo long even when double knotted. The cushioning around the ankle also seems lighter in the LEs. Despite how cool they look, I think I have to send these back for another pair of regular 10s.",
110257,1,10/19/2017,"If you liked the 8 don't buy the 10 I loved the Ghost 8! Put tons of miles on them and loved every step. I was really worried about replacing them and it seems my concerns were founded. Were the 8 excelled the 10 has disappointed. First, the shoe was fitted by a professional so I know I have the correct size and width, but somehow the shoe never feels like it is on my foot. My last run my toes went numb because the shoe was laced so tight... still didn't feel firm on my foot somehow. The toe is far too wide... or feels like it any way. Cushioning is sub par in comparison the ride of the 8. This shoe reminds of the Nike Lunar Glide 5... which is not a good thing.",
110257,5,10/18/2017,"Definitely Would Buy Again - Great Shoes! I run around 9-15 miles a week, and these shoes are absolutely great. This is my 5th pair of Brooks and the best I've ever gotten.",
110257,5,10/18/2017,Ghost 10 is a winner I have run in Brooks since 1978. I decided to try out the Ghost 10. They are by far the most comfortable running shoe I have had.,
110257,5,10/17/2017,"Great shoe, comfortable Buy your everyday, walking around shoe size.  Fits perfectly.  No need to go 1/2 size up.",
110257,4,10/16/2017,"Solid shoe overall I previously have worn New Balance the past few years but decided to return to Brooks after reading some reviews. Initially, I had sore soles of my feet with the first run or two but that improved over time and the shoes feel alot better now. The traction is great with the fall weather and wet surfaces and leaves. I'd definitely recommend to another person. Perhaps try on in store to appreciate any subtle differences in the arch support.",
110257,5,10/16/2017,My new favorite brand ,
110257,5,10/16/2017,AWESOME!!!!!! LIFE CHANGING!!!!!!! I have owned a pair of the Ghost line since the 7s.  I can tell you this from my own experience the Ghost 10's are amazing and better than any other pair of Ghost I have owned.  Somehow they have managed to make the shoe feel lighter and even more stable.  I have a good 50 miles on them already and they still feel brand new.  Im extremely happy and will be buying another pair. #ReviewSweepsI have lost 115lbs after battling Cancer at the age of 30.  When I first started running I had feet problems.  Thank you Brooks (ghost) for providing me with a shoe I can run pain free in.  Running has changed my life THANK YOU,
110257,4,10/16/2017,"Decent shoe It's a very nice shoe but I am concerned about the durability, the fabric on the outside is prone to snags. This happened (snag) while running on asphalt trail through a park. On a side note, I wish you still had the running shoes I feel in love with years ago, they had a removable liner that fit your foot like a sock. Those shoes were the most comfortable running shoes ever!",
110257,5,10/16/2017,"I will buy these shoes again and again mile after mile. I am a runner, I train for races off and on, currently training for a marathon and these shoes are fantastic.",
110257,3,10/16/2017,"Love the 10s but the Limited Edition misses the mark The Ghost 10s are fantastic, but this review is for the Ghost 10LE Limited Edition is a big disappointment. Positive: The LE is the best looking running shoe I've seen from Brooks.Cons: The LE runs very differently than the regular Ghost 10. It may be all about the laces. They are certainly a problem. They are the thin/flat laces that harken back to the older Ghost versions, which by itself is fine. But these laces are 1) very, very long, and 2) have very heavy gold tips. The tips flap back and forth while I run and feel heavy.I normally put on a new pair of Ghosts and hit the road, no break in needed.After 3 or 4 runs in the Ghost 10LEs, I'm still having to stop after a mile or so to re-tie the shoes to make them tighter, and that simply exacerbates the long laces issue and the heavy lace tips clang around my feet and ankles.The LEs look amazing, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to return them for another pair of the regular Ghost 10s, which are amazing comfortable, lightweight, yet supportive.",
110257,5,10/15/2017,"24hr shifts Wearing these on hospital 24hr shifts, no pains or aches like with my asics or under armor. Definitely raised the bar for comfort, especially for my wide feet.",
110257,3,10/13/2017,Recheck your size in between purchases I was fitted for EE width from a running store and was wearing them more for work then running.  I decided to purchase two pairs for running in the same size and width.  I didn't realize until 1 1/2 ago that the size needs to be wider.,
110257,5,10/12/2017,Many generations of Ghost. Great shoe - slight problem. I have 3 new pairs different colors. Love the white/navy/gold but they have different strings than the other 2. Too long and with metal tips - not good for running.,
110257,5,10/12/2017,Feels great ,
110257,5,10/10/2017,"My new PR & BQ shoes! After a couple runs to ensure they were good to go, I wore these in the 2017 Chicago Marathon.  They felt great - my favorite Ghost so far, and I've been wearing Ghosts since the Ghost 7.  These shoes carried me to a 40 second marathon PR and a BQ!  I love the way they look - the gold tipped laces are nice.",
110257,5,10/08/2017,Great product ,
110257,5,10/08/2017,Big fan of the ghost line Love the Brooks Ghost line of running shoes. I have several pairs and have run two full marathons and several half marathons in Brooks Ghosts. My only complaint about Ghost 10 is that they do not lace up tight like the previous models.,
110257,4,10/06/2017,"My fourth pair of Ghosts It's always tough to remember the first time you slipped on your last pair of shoes but when I put on the Ghost 10 LE they felt a little tighter than I recall on the Ghost 9 but not uncomfortably so.  This version feels lighter / faster than the Ghost 9 and I really appreciate how breathable they feel.  The only thing I dislike about the Ghost 10 is the shoelaces - they're thinner than previous editions and when I untie them my fingernails dig into the material - I get the impression they're going to shred apart/pile with time - also, though nit picky,  they are way too long",
110257,5,10/06/2017,Yes ! Yes ! Yes! ,
110257,5,10/06/2017,Love these shoes ,
110257,5,10/05/2017,"Outstanding value This is my second pair of Ghosts and my third pair of Brooks overall (Glycerin). I'm officially a convert. I'm over 6' 0"" and 200 lbs. and I run several times a week for half-marathon training. The Ghost 10s feel great right out of the box and provide more than adequate cushioning for my road runs of all distances. While I'm intrigued by the Levitate and may put that into my rotation at some point, for a runner like me with relatively modest goals, I feel like the Ghost is the only shoe I'll ever need. And it doesn't hurt that the Ghost offers terrific value at its price point vs. like models from other brands.",
110257,5,10/05/2017,I WOULD BUY THESE AGAIN ,
110257,5,10/05/2017,"Best shoe with the best company This is the best running shoe I've ever had. I previously had the Brooks GTS14 and loved them but thought I should try something else by them. I'm incredibly happy with the Ghost 10. I also have to thank the Brooks team for keeping their 90 day true blue promise that they will exchange your sneakers if you're not completely happy with them after trying them out. I ordered a half size too big from Dicks, and when Dicks wouldn't exchange them, Brooks took my shoes back and exchanged them with ease! I'm a loyal Brooks customers now.",

110257,4,10/04/2017,Nice looking shoe and comfortable I took them out on a 13 mile long Run and they held up great. The shoe is comfortable with no complaints.,
110257,5,10/04/2017,Another great Brooks running shoe! ,
110257,5,10/03/2017,I would buy again Very comfortable running shoe with a lot of support and cushion without being spongy.,
110257,4,10/02/2017,"Most comfy shoe ever but gotta return-why? I love my shoes, however the sole on the bottom left shoe is detached in 2 places already. I've had them for just 2 weeks! I'm disappointed that this happened so quickly. I need to send them back but I hate to be without them!",
110257,2,10/02/2017,"something has changed This is the third year I have purchased these shoes - but something has changed from prior years.  The shoes this year are not as comfortable - specifically they do not feel as cushioned.  In addition, they feel a little bigger to me - like I should have ordered a half size smaller.  Last, I need a ""2E"" width and, with limited colors, the shoes I have now look like they are orthopedic.  I am afraid I am going to have to look for a different running shoe brand moving forward",
110257,5,10/02/2017,Best shoes yet ,
110257,4,10/02/2017,Wow these shoes are ugly Love the ghosts. Always have. But darn these ghost 10s are ugly. Guess I'll have to wait till the next line or find a different shoe. Yes I'd recommend these shoes. But not this line.,

I run between 10:30 - 11:00 minute pace per mile.  I provide this information for anyone similar to me out there.  I cannot recommend these shoes highly enough!  I have tried everything from the Nimbus to the Vomero to Wave Riders and this Ghost 10 is the most comfortable shoe I have run in to date!  I have a wide foot and the 2E option fits perfectly.  I have over 50 miles on these shoes and have already ordered my second pair.  Try them out, you won't be disappointed!",

Size 15 in Brooks( size 13.5 actual measured shoe size).Ok for excercise ( fast ) walking but glycerine feel much better during running.So got new Glycerines too and they are again most comfortable sneakers ever had.Like Shadow styling and will keep black shadows as comfortable casual sneakers.Prefer more conservative styling( I'm 57 and because so comfortable, I like wearing with casual shorts or jeans when not running/ walking.",
110257,2,10/01/2017,Not good for bunions ,
110257,5,09/30/2017,Best Ghost Version Yet I've been running in the Ghosts since the 7's.   This is the perfect high mileage road shoe.   I run marathons and average anywhere from 40 -70 miles per week.   The 10s feel like softest ride yet.  There is no sacrifice to a fast forward transition which is great for tempo or faster paced long runs (16-20 miles).   Best shoe on the market,
110257,5,09/30/2017,Best Shoe Ever Friends had told me about Brooks and I usually shied away due to cost but these shoes are the absolute best shoes I have ever owned.  I bought them yesterday and at many peoples' warning said do not wear them for a race the next day.  So I didn't listen and wore them and these shoes absolutely conform to your foot to the point they literally feel like an extension of your body and foot.  My knees not matter how much or little usually hurt after a 5K but I ran 7 miles today and no pain whatsoever.  Great shoe!!!,
110257,5,09/29/2017,"By far, the most comfortable running shoes I have ever worn. ",
110257,5,09/27/2017,"First time Brooks Running Shoe buyer it will not be the last I'm 70 years old and I needed supportive shoes because I have Metatarsalgia (my second metatarsal bones are 50% longer than they should be and create a great deal of pain after working all day on hard concrete floors.  My doctor told me to get running shoes for better support when using my orthotics. I tried makers N, NB, Ad, & UA and even using my custom orthotics the pain came back. As a last resort I gave Brooks running shoes a try (Ghost 10) and ""No Pain"". It was like a miracle to me. I will buy nothing but Brooks and I would recommend anyone that buys walking shoes step up and try these running shoes. Even though I don't run they are flat out comfortable.  Thank you Brooks!",
110257,5,09/23/2017,"Really surprised i hate running, but when i first tried them i was surprised that they took most of the pain away from the impacts. would definitely recommend trying.",
110257,4,09/21/2017,"Great Shoe! The ghost is a great shoe - but keep in mind with the LE (gold/blue) shoe the laces are junk.  They are super thin and have metal ends on them, so if you plan to walk in them you're probably fine.  Once you replace the laces, you're good.",
110257,4,09/20/2017,"12mm drop is way too much... like high heels... It would be great if Brooks started making their shoes with lower drops. 10-12mm is just too much these days. 8mm for ravenna, ghost and defyance please!!",
110257,5,09/19/2017,"Love the feel! I just started running again about 5 months ago and as my mileage increased, so did my ankle pain. I was recently fitted for the first time and I bought the Ghost 10's and I love them. I'm almost 50 now and needed the extra cushion but it took me a run or two to get used to it, now I wouldn't wear anything else. Ankles and knees are doing great and I'm no longer reluctant to push for longer runs of 10+ miles.",
110257,5,09/18/2017,Best fit the First time I am a walker who does 40 miles a week in my ghosts.  Normally it would tak me a little while to break in a new pair (I go through 4 pair a year).  Ghosts 10 were comfotable the first time i put them on. The cushioned heel was a big deal on my feet. No blisters this time!!!!,

110257,5,09/14/2017,"Repeat purchaser - if only I could get >300 miles on a pair After wearing out close to a dozen pairs of Ghost 7s and 8s over the last few years, I was devastated (too strong? no way, shoes are important!) when the redesigned Ghost 9s did not work at all for me.Well, the Ghost 10 brings back all the was good with the Ghost line and adds additional support and comfort while maintaining a lightweight frame that lets me run in these no matter the effort or distance. I'm not setting records, but I am both setting PRs and logging more mileage when combining my custom orthotics with the Ghost hugging my foot. I only wish I could get closer to 500 miles on a pair, but 300 seems to be the max these days because the tread just disappears, which means I'm spending $500/yr on running shoes. Don't tell my wife!",

110257,3,09/13/2017,"Ghost 9 vs ghost 10 I liked the feel of the 9 better, much softer feel, my feet did not hurt after running in the ghost 9. Asics was going in this direction as they upgraded their shoes, that is why I switched to the ghosts . Now with the 10 brooks seems to be going there as well, why can't companies leave a great product alone for more than 6 months???",

110257,4,08/02/2017,Feels great but 2E width snug I have the ghost 9 2E and feel they are a perfect fit. I ordered the 10 in the exact same size and width but feel the width was snug on the wides. Not sure if it was an anomaly or what. Otherwise they felt great. I am going to try a half size larger and see if they are better.,
110257,2,08/01/2017,Brooks is has made a decision to cut quality to save money I've been buying Brooks exclusively for more than 9 years - Ghost and Glycerin. Here are a few of the corners they've cut:- There is almost zero leather on the shoe - it's all mesh and will certainly cause it to rip sooner- The reinforecment over the eyelets is paper thin as comared to the Ghost 9. - There used to be a layer of padding between the upper and the cushion. That's gone.- There is almost no styling elements on the shoe as compared to the previous models.- Even the logo has been changed from a 3-D multi color swoosh to an ironed on piece of paper.I'm so bummed. It may be time to switch to Asics...,
110257,5,07/31/2017,"After 10 years on running this is the best shoe ever I´m just amazed about the way the Ghost 10 combine a soft upper side whit a firm soil, every step feels fantastic...",
110257,5,07/31/2017,"Best Running shoe on the market! I've been wearing the ghost models since the Ghost 3's came out. I use them for trail runs and OrangeTheory workouts (About 3 miles on the treadmill each class). Recently, I decided to try out all the other major brands just to see if I was missing out. After several test runs, I slipped the ghost 10s on and it felt like heaven again. I love how the 10s are lighter than the 9s and provide excellent gel cushioning. I recommend these to anyone.",
110257,5,07/30/2017,"Like walking on clouds Adidas has always been my go to shoe.  My last pair of Adidas, the AlphaBounce, gave me issues.  My wife has worn Brooks for years and recommended me to try a pair.  I started with the Ravenna 8.  I think I went a half size to small (10 1/2), because the outside of the right shoe started to rip out.  I sent them back and ordered my first pair of Ghost 10 (11).  They felt great right out of the box.  I have put 120 miles on them in two weeks.  I have absolutely no foot pain or issues with these shoes. I love them and have already ordered my second pair in another color.  Brooks has now become my go to shoe.  Kudos to Brooks for a shoe well done.",

I started having lower back pain walking, friend recommended me to get a pair of Brooks Ghost10. Back pain gone after 2 wks. This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever walked in!!!! Hooked for life on Ghost10 !! I've already added around 4 more miles per wk.",
110257,5,07/28/2017,Love these shoes Excellent! Fairly light weight with good structure. As someone with healing ankle injuries I feel well supported to get my my run on!,

110257,5,07/27/2017,"Best ghost yet Had to return the Ghost 9 because the rubber overlay on toebox was not big toe friendly. These are perfect in every way. Make way Ghost 6, you have been surpassed as best version by the 10.",
110257,5,07/27/2017,"Awesome shoes, I would buy them again ",
110257,5,07/26/2017,"Best running shoe ever created! I have run in nearly every brand of premium running shoes, this is by far the best shoe I have ever experienced! I only wish I would have started with the Ghost One! Bravo Brooks, I am you newest fan.",
110257,5,07/26/2017,Great running shoe I've been running in ghost for several years now. This years shoes are wonderful! Love the neutral color and the fit and feel could not be better!,
110257,5,07/24/2017,These shoes met all my expectations I run on pavement and these shoes provide the cushion I need for a comfortable run without a pounding on my knees,
110257,5,07/21/2017,"Best Shoe for the price for me I usually wear New Balance but I have developed some knee issues lately so I decided to fork over the extra cash and get a higher end pair of shoes. These are absolutely the softest feeling, smoothest riding pair of shoes I have ever laced up. Much softer than the Asics Nimbus-19's and Asics GT2000 5's as well. I took them out for a 3 miler this morning....  No break-in and no issues. Felt like gliding on pillows",
110257,5,07/19/2017,Best Ghost version yet Was disappointed in Ghost 9. My big toe did not like that rubber overlay on the toebox. Brooks wisely did away with that this time out. My previous favorite version was the Ghost 6 but the 10 surpasses that. Extremely comfortable toe box and a shoe that's broken in right out of the box.,
110257,5,07/19/2017,I like  comfortable ! ,
110257,5,07/18/2017,"Super light, super cushion, loved the new design. I'm a fan. ",

110257,5,07/15/2017,"Good tweaks to a good shoe! I run about 20 miles a week when I can. Replaced my Ghost 9s with these. 10s feel even better than the 9s out of the box. Toe box was brought in a little. Heel is more comfortable. Smoother transition. And tread seems to have slightly better traction, which I enjoy because I hit dirt, gravel, pavement, and grass on my runs. These are my cushy, longer run shoes. Short and fast runs, or need to switch it up, I run the Launch. I wear the same size in both. And I run the Mazama for trail and which I run 1/2 size smaller.",
110257,3,07/14/2017,"Why oh why would you change a good thing! My old ghost was a 5 STAR, shame on you for changing the perfect shoe. Achilles  cut away gone, arch support weakened and less stability.  What are you people thinking!",
110257,5,07/14/2017,"Best Ghost yet I'm 6'4"", 210 lbs.  Had each generation of Ghosts since the 7's....the 10's have been by far the most comfortable ride of them all. Not too heavy and just the right amount of cushion.  Only minus is that I wish there were more colors to chose from. Overall great shoe.",
110257,3,07/05/2017,"Half Size too Big; True to Width I previously bought and still wear Ghost 9 - size 11, 2 E. Perfect fit! Great shoe! I just bought Ghost 10 - size 11, 2 E. Much too long in the toe box.I wear the shoes on alternating days, thus the size difference and ride are noticeable.Buy your Ghost 10s in a running store (i.e., try them on first). Make sure they fit.",
110257,5,07/02/2017,"Epitome of the shoemaking art Usually I hear about a great shoe after its no longer available, I was so glad to be one of the first to get the Ghost 10 (from Emerhoff's in Ames). You get this luxurious feel when you put your foot in it. Great arch support. Toe box lets your toes splay as much as needed. The ride is VERY cushy without being mushy. Ghost 10 could go as long a distance as you'd want. Ghost 11 changes should be purely cosmetic (or take the drop to 10.4 ounces and make it even lighter). The early buzz about this shoe was right. You get the feeling Brooks knows what it's doing, they made a seriously good shoe.",
110257,5,06/26/2017,"Love this shoe but .... I love the Ghost shoe.  I have run in them for about 4 years.  They are the only shoe I have run in during that time.   For me they are the perfect combination of comfort, cushion and support while still allowing me to feel the road/ground.  My only issue is the Men's Ghost 10 colors put me to sleep - so drab!  Please, please introduce some brighter colors in the shoe's mid-release so I can ""Run Happy!"".",
110258,5,12/26/2017,"My new favorite running shoe - I'm 6' 245 and really like this shoe over others as it's got plenty of room in the toe box, feels great, is very light and has plenty of cushion.  The Glycerin 15 is a real winner.  I am hoping to start putting these to more use to get down to 225 in 2018!",
110258,5,12/20/2017,Glycerin 15 ,
110258,2,12/19/2017,Not as Good as should be Not as good as I was expecting. Supposed to have increased cushioning but not better than my ghost 9 but does cost more. Disappointed,
110258,4,12/18/2017,I am very happy with my new Brooks I think the shoe should be more cushioning. I ran 25 k and the Hoka do better for the long runs,
110258,2,12/17/2017,Not the same feel as the 14s The 15s aggravate my Plantars Faciatitus.  The Transends seem to be a much better fit for me.  Maybe it's the shoe or my foot has changed.  The 14s didn't seem to bother me.,
110258,5,12/14/2017,The Best ,
110258,1,12/12/2017,"Mixed Emotions I have mixed emotions here.  I have worn Brooks and Glycerins for years starting with 13s, 14s, and this 15.  I love the color for once and the quality is great.  However, I wore these on vacation to Orlando theme parks and my big toes hurt after walking all day.  I called and received new inserts to help but to no avail.  There is virtually no toe support and it is causing a lot of pain.  I went to the podiatrist and had every test run on me to say no issues but likely the shoe.  I returned them today and will seek a new model.  These were the most uncomfortable Glycerins that I have ever worn regrettably.   Any suggestions?",
110258,5,12/09/2017,"What a difference I started running about a month ago.  Then my heel started to hurt about 2 weeks ago, so I stopped.  My heel actually hurt just while walking.  This past Tuesday I went to my chiropractor who took 2 seconds to look at the shoes I was running in and said ""Change your shoes.""  Tuesday afternoon I went and bought the Brooks Glycerin 15.  Wednesday I was running again with no pain.  By today, Saturday, I was up to 40 minutes.  What a difference.",

This shoes did not gave me any pain at all, the fit is perfect, helping to keep  the motivation for running every day. My only complain is the durability, my first pair last only 400 kms but it was so good than I bought a second pair without hesitation. Now I'm planning to alternate this with a pair of Ghost 10.",
110258,5,11/28/2017,"Great shoes, would buy again ",
110258,5,11/27/2017,"Best shoe ever. I have worn the glycerin 13, 14, and 15. This is my favorite shoe by far and brooks has fixed every issue that I had with the last ones. The shoe is made of a very good material and lasts throughout the miles. I have been running 45 miles a week with these shoes and can't complain. They remain comfortable even on longer runs. After owning these shoes for 3 months I am ready for another pair. I'm definitely going to buy again!!!!",
110258,5,11/27/2017,love the glycerin This is my 3 pair of Glycerins. I love that shoe absorbs so much impact versus my joints. There is a significant change in the shoe length in the 15. I had to go from my normal 10 1/2 to 11 in order to keep my toes my rubbing the front of shoe.,
110258,4,11/26/2017,Great but 14 was better The 15's are good shoes but the 14's were way more cushy and more overall comfortable.,
110258,5,11/24/2017,"Awesome shoe. Love my Glycerins! Love this soft, plush shoe. It's really one of the best shoes I've ever run in. 56 miles on it so far and heading out for some more right now. Thanks, Brooks!",
110258,5,11/21/2017,Unbelievably Cushioned Run I've gone from 50 miles per month to 70+ miles per month since switching to the glycerine 15 from NB (which I was wearing for about 15 years).  No more knee and calf issues.,
110258,5,11/19/2017,3rd pair as good as the first! I was measured nd sized at a running store. Suggested 2 brands. I chose Brooks and will not change.,
110258,5,11/17/2017,Very comfortable shoe to run in and wear all day at work. ,
110258,1,11/13/2017,"Terrible They changed the toe box. It now rubs the tops of my toe nails. There is now way I could run any distance in them. As soon as I run out of my supply of Glycerin 14s, I'll be looking for something other than Glycerins. Hey Brooks, when you've got a good product leave it alone. I've worn Brooks for many years, but maybe not any more.",
110258,5,11/11/2017,"I would buy this product again and again, already have!! ",
110258,5,11/09/2017,Great Product ,
110258,5,11/06/2017,Best running shoe! The option for wider width combined with the great cushion make this shoe my favorite!,
110258,5,11/05/2017,"Excellent high mileage, cushioned, train shoe The Glycerin 15 test shoe is an excellent, cushioned/resilient high mileage train shoe that supports natural neutral foot running transition. It is well balanced, of excellent durability and weight for high mileage training. The traction is excellent on paved surfaces and very good on gravel and dirt roads and off road surfaces. The flexible upper mesh material is an improvement over past Glycerin models. I would highly recommend the shoe for high mileage training.   #ReviewSweeps",
110258,4,11/05/2017,Love the 15 ! Much better comfort and ride than the 14 ! ,
110258,5,11/02/2017,"It changed me!!!! I was not at all into running and slowly when I started putting weight I decided to run. One of the first thing I did was a research on running and it all came down to the shoes. I had 3 choices and when I went to the Dick's store, I just felt very comfortable with glycerin. It's been a year now and I usually don't give reviews. But I took time to write this up for anyome who is starting to run and confused in the market for shoes. You are at the right place. It is little costly, no doubt. But it's worth every single penny. I have recommended this to my friends and most have them purchased this as well.. they are happy just like me.  Rock on Brooks...",
110258,1,11/02/2017,"The 15's not for me. The cushion has worn out after 9 weeks. I'm pretty bummed, I've worn Glycerins for several years and they've never worn out this fast. After even a short 3 mile run my feet, knees and back ache. I'm going to look at another brand.",

110258,5,10/26/2017,"This is one sweet road shoe! I bought the Glycerin 14 and loved it, so when I heard the 15 was more comfortable I had to try them out and I wasn't dissapponted! Just the right amount of cushion for the long runs, while staying fast for a trainer. They do feel a half size small in the length but that could be my crazy feet! #ReviewSweeps",
110258,4,10/24/2017,Solid shoe with great comfort for wider feet like mine. ,
110258,5,10/22/2017,Great Shoe!! Very comfortable shoe!. Perfect shoe to get rid of my achillies/calf problems.,
110258,5,10/18/2017,Second pair of Glycerin These shoes are very comfortable. I walk on a treadmill and also use an AMT elliptical. My feet feel much better since I have started wearing the Glycerin 15.,
110258,5,10/18/2017,Best running and walking shoe on the market bar none!!5stars First pair of Brooks running shoes. The best running shoe I have ever worn. I had Achilles tendinitis and this shoe cured me. 5 stars,
110258,5,10/18/2017,"Brooks Glycerin After 2 pairs of Brooks Glycerin, I can say that they are the best shoes I have ever used.  the cushion in this shoe is the best I have ever felt from a running shoe, and if you want to log more miles while training this is your shoe.  The ventilation in these shoes is really good, and my feet never feel hot after a running. As for the weight I have had no problems with these shoes.  The glycerin are the smoothest shoe I have felt when transitioning from my heal to toe. These shoes held up for over 350 miles and and daily use.  If you are a neutral runner and you wand a shoe with a lot of cushion, this is an amazing shoe.",
110258,1,10/16/2017,I prefer my Asics over these. I've never had such horrible pain in my feet after running in these for over a month I can now barely do a mile without pain. Won't be purchasing ever again.,
110258,5,10/14/2017,Just what I needed for long runs. I needed something for the extra sustained pounding of long runs.   The Glycerin provided the extra comfort for me to keep going.   Worth every penny.,
110258,5,10/13/2017,great fit.  love them ,
110258,5,10/13/2017,"Excellent, comfrotable neutral shoe Wore for a marathon after getting the shoe one week early. Super comfortable, easy to break in, perfect fit.",
110258,5,10/11/2017,Awesome My first pair of Brooks and absolutely love them. Feels like your running on clouds.,
110258,4,10/10/2017,So far so good This is my first pair of brooks running shoes. I had been loyal to another brand but is there running shoe continually had issues I decided to try this year on the recommendation of another runner.  My first long distance run in the shoes seem to go well and my knees have not complained. I am hopeful of these shoes will serve me well for my next marathon.,
110258,4,10/10/2017,So far so good So far I've been happy with the shoe's  ability to  absorb shock.  This is the first time I've actually tried a Brooks shoe. The previous shoe brand I was using kept coming out with progressiveky subpar running shoes so I took a gamble on the recommendation of another runner.  My inaugural run felt good on my knees which is good as I'm starting to train for my next marathon with these shoes.,
110258,5,10/03/2017,Floating on air! My fourth pair of Brooks and by far the best. I walk 6 miles a day and couldn't be more comfortable!,
110258,5,10/03/2017,Just received mine. Perfect fit and very comfortable. Happy I walk 3 to 5 times a week on average. I love the comfort of this shoe. The shoe is also very stylish,
110258,5,10/03/2017,"Most comfortable distance show I've owned I'm currently running 6 days and approximately 45-60 miles a week.  I have used the Glycerin line since the 13, and this is my favorite model so far.  It is a great neutral running show, with the extra cushion I need for my high-milage runs.  I have also used the Ghosts for some of my shorter intra-week runs, but I noticed I started pulling my calf-muscle repeatedly whenever I would run on them for extended periods of time. Since switching exclusively to the Glycerin 15 this problem has gone away.  I only have one, somewhat shallow recommendation for Brooks.  Can you add some decent color ways to your shoe lines?  Functionally your shoes are top of the line, visually not so much.  I actually like some of the Glycerin colors you have this time around (light blue and bright red), but of course for my size (12.5) they are not available.  I usually purchase two pair of shoes and cycle through them during training, but I like them to be in different and decent colors.",
110258,5,10/01/2017,"GREAT!! I'm 6'2 , 255 lb.  Under pronator, 2E, and I use orthotics in my shoes. ... I'm extremely hard on shoe's because of my weight and the trial system I run but this shoe is so comfortable It leave's all the other shoes I've worn behind!  Getting another pair this week just for everyday life. Good job Brooks!",
110258,5,09/30/2017,"Amazing shoe but ugly as all hell This shoe is the best running shoe I've ever owned. I'm on my second pair now but I would just like to say please for the love of god Brooks make your shoes better looking. These are also one of the more ugly pairs of running shoes that I have seen. These feel amazing, are super durable, reasonably light and any one that runs avidly will love them just don't look down at your shoes and don't let anyone else either!!!",
110258,5,09/22/2017,Didn t skip a beat when you made the glycerin 15 The cushioning gets an A+.  The shoe is a bit on the heavy side but I can live with it,
110258,1,09/21/2017,"Disappointed I've owned about 20 pairs of Glycerins.  I was looking forward to the improvements of the 15s.  I usually put on a pair of Glycerins and can do a long run with them right out of the box.  The 15s just don't feel right.  I noticed right away that my toes felt like they were rubbing the end of the shoes.  They were the same size I've always bought and I compared them to my old ones and they were the same length.  Something was changed with the toe box inside the shoe.  These shoes are definitely getting returned. I did not run in them because I had no doubt that I would have had blisters after a coupe miles. I thought I'd run in Glycerins forever, so now I've got to find a new shoe.",
110258,3,09/20/2017,I returned the Glycerin 17 Did not provide enough cushion especially in the front foot area.  My little toe was getting pinched even when I ordered 2E.,
110258,5,09/18/2017,"G15 - Great Running Shoes I originally purchased a size 9 normal width G15 shoe - but sent them back for a size 9.5 with 2E width.  The shoe runs a maybe 1/2 size smaller than other shoes I have worn (even Brooks), and the G15 is more narrow than previous versions of the shoe (like the G12).  That being said - these shoes are great for running when you get the right sizing.",
110258,5,09/14/2017,Light and feel great Been running on this model since the Glycerin 11 - once a professional at a local running store recommended them it made my running experience MUCH better - wouldn't buy any other running shoe,
110258,5,09/12/2017,"Nice well cushioned shoes To start with I tend to be a bit more frugal with my running shoe money.  Usually try to spend about $100 or so for shoes.  And I have also been a long time nike shoe wearer (mostly wearing zoom air pegasus).  But it seems Nikes are starting to get way too narrow for me.  So I am looking for a different brand shoe that is cushioned and fits well on my feet.  Any everything I was reading said that these shoes are very good,  and I would agree.  So far I have only put these through a couple of short runs to date.  But are very comfortable and are cushioned very well.   Once I put these through a couple of longer runs and if things change I will change up the review.  The one suggestion I might give is maybe offer a few more ""adventurous"" type of colors.  Maybe a orange/black or a yellow/black colors to add a different type of character to the shoe.",
110258,5,09/07/2017,Yes Happy that the new edition did not mess up the previous version which happens occassionaly,
110258,3,09/07/2017,"Tread wearing too fast. I went from wearing the ghost 9 which the soles lasted about 235 miles. The Glycerin had same wear as the ghost at less than 100 miles. But, comfort wise it's great.",
110258,5,09/04/2017,"Best Brooks yet Lighter and more support than the previous versions of this shoe.  An absolute pleasure pounding the miles with it.  The bottom wears a little quicker than I like, but the shoe is so nice I'll take it",
110258,5,09/04/2017,"Usain Bolt should have used these shoes in competiton. It is difficult to get a running shoe in my size (14) and width (B) but these shoes fit like a glove, are lightweight, increase my speed,  and are cushioned to the point that my feet do not hurt like they do in other shoes. It is so easy to  make transition in stride and conformation and do so quickly  with the Glycerin 15 in running and powerwalking. They are pricey, but I am glad I made the investment.",
110258,5,09/04/2017,"15 is back to basics I fell in love with Glycerin 13's, and felt like 14 was a step back in quality and fit (didn't last me 200 miles without severe wear). I feel like the 15 is a return to the shoe I loved - fits and feels great, plenty of support and cushion. I like 'em.",
110258,5,09/03/2017,"Quality, right out of the box I ran 18 miles the same day I bought this shoe- no issues. Hoping they hold up well for my future long runs (I don't review shoes often so I am very satisfied with my purchase)",

110258,3,08/20/2017,"Dang it.. I've worn Glyerin 12, 13 and 14's and loved them all.  Bought the 15's and developed back and hip issues within a couple weeks.  Went to my pedorthist (who I've seen for 17 years and sells Brooks shoes, exclusively) to have my orthotics checked and he told me the shoe has become too soft for me, especially at 5'!0' and 235 pounds.  He showed me how soft the outsole (from the heel to mid foot) has become and how it is already breaking down (horizontal compression lines were 1/2 way up from the sole to the upper at the right heal).  So, I'm staying with the 14s and hope the 16s will have a more firm outsole.",
110258,5,08/20/2017,I would buy Glycerine 16s again I walk 5-10 miles a night at work during a 12 hour shift and my feet don't ever hurt afterwards.,

I thought it might just be the pair, but I bought another and the same thing happened. I have been buying Glycerins for many years without issue. One of the big reasons was the durability. Unfortunately, I will have to look for another shoe.",
110258,5,08/07/2017,I would buy this product again and again I run and I am an rn and I am on my feet all day. These shoes are very cushioned and comfortable and my legs and feet don't hurt at the end of a long shift.,
110258,5,08/06/2017,Love them! Even better than 14s ,
110258,1,08/03/2017,Back pain and wouldn't buy again I have been using the brooks glycerin for almost 6 years now and ever since I got the 15s I got very bad lower back pain. I run 65-75 miles a week and land mid foot strike first time use I had such bad back pain I took a day off running. Tried them again the next day same thing used the 14s for a week no pain. As soon as I tried the 15s again the back pain came back. 19 years old nothing changed but the shoe.,
110258,5,08/03/2017,"The best shoe I've ever owned. I've had a myriad of foot, knee, and hip problems and this is by far the most accommodating shoe I've EVER owned. My PT recommended the Glycerin 13 to me last year and I've been loyal to Brooks and the Glycerin model ever since. The bottom line is that this shoe has improved the quality of my life.",
110258,5,07/29/2017,"Comfy and spacious The most plush, comfy, and spacious Glycerin shoes yet. No break in period and they look great.",
110258,5,07/25/2017,"Great pair of shoes!- I am just trying to get back into running so I needed a shoe that had lots of cushion to support my joints.  I love this show, it feels great and keeps me out running!",
110258,5,07/22/2017,"Incredible I was a big fan of the Glycerin 12, but not so much the Glycerin 13 and 14.  I am extremely pleased with the 15.  The cushioning is amazing, there is plenty of it, but still firm enough.  They felt amazing right out of the box.  I have used the shoes outdoors and on the treadmill, great for either.  I ordered my usual Glycerin size 9.5, but found it felt just a bit too small.  I returned them an ordered another half size up.  I brought the bright blue, and find the other color choices a little boring.  I hope Brooks offers some brighter color choices soon.  This is definitely one of the best shoes I have ever run in, and will likely buy a couple more pairs.",
110258,3,07/18/2017,Runs small Love Brooks shoes and have always bought 10.5. These shoes run small. Didn't realize how small until wearing 3 days in a row on trip.,
110258,5,07/18/2017,"Comfortable and light, great color.  Sized different. The shoes are very comfortable and very light.  The sizing is different.  I always ordered a 10.5 but in this pair, I need an additional half a inch.",
110258,3,07/15/2017,"Sad: I think I'm done with Glycerin I ran in Glycerin for years -- and loved it. It was my favorite shoe. It saw me through many races, tough training, and two marathons. But somewhere along the way (I've forgotten which iteration), it got too narrow and started pinching my big toes. It ultimately became impossible for me to run in them. So I was thrilled when Brooks introduced wide sizes in Glycerin, but alas I was incredibly disappointed to find that the *wide* Glycerin 15 doesn't really feel wide at all. It's still tight, and it still pinches. I should maybe say at this point that I'm not a wide person. I don't wear wide in any shoe: running, soccer, dress, or casual. But there is something in the way that Brooks alone seems to make their shoes that makes them very tight on my feet. Launch suffers from this for me. And Ghost does too, but at least Ghost works in the wide size for me. When I wear Ghost wides, it feels comfortable, and it feels wide. The Glycerin 15 wide really doesn't feel wide at all. And, unfortunately, I can't run in it. I love Brooks, and I'd love to run in their shoes until the end of time, but it bums me out that they seem to want to make really narrow shoes that just aren't a great fit for me.",
110258,2,07/14/2017,"Too Narrow The cushioning in the Glycerin is fantastic. Not too soft, firm but cushioned. However, the forefoot is way too narrow, causing blisters. The Ghosts always fit me perfectly, but don't have quite enough cushion. Really confused as to why Brooks makes the Glycerins so narrow.",
110258,5,07/14/2017,Most Cushion Ever I'm 50 with plantar's fascia.  The amount of cushion and support these running shoes provide allows me to run my 2-3 mile session pain free.,
110258,2,07/13/2017,High ankle padding The additional padding at the ankle was to high and rubbed on my ankle bone so I have returned these shoes.,
110258,5,07/13/2017,Best comfortable shoe on market Although these shoes are made for running. I walk and stand on concrete all day long and the comfort of these shoes are amazing. They are a must buy,
110258,3,07/12/2017,A little to squishy ,
110258,5,07/12/2017,Best running shoe I've owned. Great fit for wide feet. This is the best fitting running shoe I have owned. Finding the right fit can be a challenge with other brands but I was able to find a 2E without issue. I also have a pin in my fifth metatarsal (from injury about 15 years ago) and this is first pair of shoes that don't eventually remind me of that.,
110258,3,07/10/2017,Glycerine 15 Glycerine 15 is about a half size too small.  Great cushion if that's what your after.  A bit too much cushion for me.,
110258,5,07/10/2017,INCREDIBLE I AM ELITE RUNNER AND MARATHONER 19 UNDER MY BELT..I HAVE TRIED EVERY RUNNING SHOES EVERY COMPANY AND HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS IS MY LAST STOP...I LOVE THE FEELING AND COMFORT OF THIS RUNNING SHOES..I STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!,
110258,5,07/09/2017,"Nice shoes I love Brooks Glycerins, my first pair was the Glycerin 11. However, I hope the sole of Glycerin 15 (both the side and bottom) should not be color white. It get easily dirty and the unclean parts are easily seen or noticed.",
110258,3,07/09/2017,The new Glycerin 15's are too small Glycerin is my goto marathon shoe.  My last 6 pairs have all been size 11 with no issues.  With the Glycerin 15 in that same size my toes hit the end of the toe box on the outer side.  The tips of my toes are blistered and I will be returning these shoes going back to the 14's.  Really disappointed.,
110258,3,07/09/2017,like the color ,
110258,5,07/09/2017,"Comfortable Shoe.  Would buy it again, and again, and again, Very comfortable Running Shoe.  It's difficult to find a shoe that is comfortable.  Will be loading up on this model.",
110258,5,07/08/2017,"Definite improvement over the 14 These are a definite improvement over the 14's. The cushioning has gone to another level. The ride is more cushioned and also more responsive. There's a bounce to the ride that I like. As usual, the upper is extremely plush and feels great on your feet. I had to go up a half size to keep my toes from hitting the front of the shoe when running down hill, but other than that it's all good!",
110258,5,07/06/2017,"I had my doubts, but now! In the past I had my doubts regarding Brooks running shoes, I didn't like how they felt on my feet and I felt that the quality was suspect. I have tried almost every brand out there over the 20 years,  hands down the comfort of Brooks can't be surpassed!",
110258,2,07/05/2017,Too many changes The toe box is too snug with lack of cushioning under the ball of the foot and too much behind the heal.,
110258,3,07/04/2017,Great feel.. ,
110258,5,07/04/2017,I would and have bought this product again and again. ,
110258,5,07/03/2017,"Great The Glycerin 15 is a great shoe.   They are very comfortable to work in all day on concrete floors.    Very,  very satisfied with the new Glycerin.",
110258,5,07/03/2017,"Brooks Glycerin 15 I have worn the Asics Nimbus for years, but I believe this shoe provides more cushioning and with less weight.  I may have found my new favorite running shoe!",
110258,5,07/01/2017,Love the glycerin shoe the best running shoe i found.5 pairs ,
110258,5,06/29/2017,Great shoe I've had the 14's and loved them but the 15's are a great upgrade. Better fit and cushioning than the 14's. Very happy with them.,
110258,3,06/29/2017,"FINALLY - One Good Color I have been slightly injured the past few weeks so I have not been able to start using the shoe yet for running. For walking it feels great, just as I would expect the Glycerin upgrade to be. I'm just disappointed with Brooks designers when it comes to color choices. I've voiced my opinion on this before, but one person cannot make the directional change on this topic. They finally gave men a nice bright blue color and a solid red color. That's nice, but the other colors are just drab. I understand they need to be somewhat subdued for others, but it would be fantastic if you provided some greens, yellows, and PURPLES!!!!  For the price we are paying for shoes, we should get better selection of color options. I'd wait an extra few weeks to have those options created so that you don't have to pre-spend inventory dollars. Perhaps let us design our own for an extra $10 like Nike ID. JUST A THOUGHT.",
110258,5,06/29/2017,Excellent shoe. ,
110258,2,06/28/2017,"Not worth it For the extra cost of the Glycerin 15 - it is not worth it.  The padding feels no different and, for the first time ever after lots of different brands, I got blisters on my left heal Sunday after breaking the show in slowly.  Like my Adrenaline much better",
110258,5,06/27/2017,GLYCERIN 15 This was a Father's day gift. My husband  noticed the improvements on the 15. It's like running on pillows.,
110258,5,06/22/2017,"Amazing These are my first pair of Brooks and I will be brand loyal from this day forward.  Just from the initial trying of the shoe on, I literally said ""wow"" out loud.  Comfortable is an understatement.  There is so much cushioning and support it really is like a cloud for your feet.  I just finished a 7 mile break in run and my normal minimal shin and foot pain is gone.  I remember thinking during my run, I could go for days in these shoes.  I must say thank you Brooks!  I did a lot of research before buying and now I understand what a real running shoe is like.  You have a customer for life.",
110258,5,06/22/2017,AMAZING I AM ELITE RUNNER AND MARATHONER..I HAD TRIED EVERY RUNNING SHOES OUT THERE AND BY FAR THIS BRAND IT'S MY FAVORITE I OWN 4- PAIRS OF RUNNING SHOES (TRANSCEND 4) ( ADRENALINE GTS 16) ( BEAST 16 LE) AND THE NEW ( GLYCERIN 15)..AM IMPRESSED BY THE RETURN POLICY..ALL I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS MY LAST STOP..LOVE THIS COMPANY,
110258,5,06/20/2017,The best shoes I've ever put on my feet... No need to break these shoes in ...they are broken in as soon as you put your feet in them..the stretchy yet supportive shell feels fantastic on a long run...I would recommend the shoes to anyone...Thank you Brooks you've out done yourself this time..,
110258,5,06/19/2017,"Comfortable Quality shoe I wanted to make sure I ran in these a couple times before I gave a review.  I had the Adrenaline 117's, but had to return them as something with the left shoe didn't feel right.  Caused a little pain in the midfoot.  I got these after trying them on in the store.  These shoes fit like a glove.  I am 6'3"", 255 lbs.  I really love the cushioning of this shoe.  They're so comfortable.  I don't usually ever have pain after running, maybe a little stiffness, but after running in these I felt great.  Thinking about going for a second run today as I sit here typing.  Glycerin is definitely one shoe that justifies the price tag.",
110258,5,06/14/2017,The best running shoes I have owned I run on trails as well as treadmills and these shoes are by far the best I have tried. I have owned Brooks Ghost 9 and countless Nike products and I will never go back to Nike.,
110258,5,06/11/2017,Incerdible support I've had several pairs of Brooks running shoes and these are by far the best and most supportive shoes they've come out with yet. So glad they caught with other brands as far as the looks too. Overall an amazing shoe choice for someone that's active and has achilles heal issues.,
110259,5,10/14/2017,Love them. Second pair! ,
110259,2,10/03/2017,"Not as Good as They Used to be I bought these shoes a couple years ago and LOVED them.  I should have stocked up on them then.  I am a female, but like the feel of these men's shoes better.  This newer addition  doesn't fit the same.  The bottoms of my feet get sore and tired when wearing them.  The previous generation of this shoe was perfect for my feet so I had very high expectations.",
110259,5,10/01/2017,Very Nice! These shoes have an amazing amount of cushion for the weight of the shoe! They also have very good traction which is great for the rocky muddy trails around me. The box said they are a D width which is a little wider than average but it fit my foot very well.,
110259,5,09/14/2017,"Excellent Got these about 2 months ago, and have loved them.  I've mostly been using Nike's Flex Run series last few years, sometimes alternating with Brooks PureFlows -- i.e., somewhat minimal shoes that allow a relatively natural gait.  I was looking into trail shoes with more of a sole on them to account for some of the trails I'm running right now.  These PureGrits have been great -- no rocks busting my feet up but still has a minimal feel that lets my feet glide along.  They've been ok in puddles / light rain, but haven't really taken them out in a storm yet (I know they aren't waterproof).Overall fit was great.  (My feet are on the narrow side).More than anything, though, was the piece of mind ordering with their guarantee.  Hooray!Thanks, Brooks!",
110259,5,08/26/2017,"Have run this shoe for three years. Run 20 miles a week, all trails.  I crushed my foot more that 10 years ago, it's full of pins and commonly painful. The sole of the shoe is great - if you stomp on a rock you'll feel it, but won't be sharp.  I've owned 3-4 generations of this shoe.  The previous one was a bit of a disappointment.  The tongue of the previous shoe was narrow, rigid and hard to get on without creating pressure points.  In this shoe they've gone back to making the tongue integral to a lycra structure in the shoe that wraps your foot infront of the ankle.  I find that extraordinarily comfortable.  Between that and the zero drop, there's no other shoe like it.  So they've got me hooked, I keep coming back... about every 6 months.",
110259,5,08/21/2017,good Good feel of the road and adequate cushioning. Felt a little tight in the front heightwise  but felt alright after loosening the laces.,
110259,5,08/14/2017,Excellent trail specific shoe This was my first trail specific shoe in a while and I love it. Will certainly buy again when the time comes,
110259,4,08/10/2017,Fit small I have been an avid Brooks shoe consumer for the last 5 years.  This is the first shoe that didn't fit true to size as it ran about a half size too small.  I love the design but had to return this pair upon receiving it.,
110259,5,07/09/2017,"Brooks Nails New PureGrit The all new PureGrit from Brooks is something special. This is a great option for neutral runners who are looking for a more minimal feel on the trails, without having to run with minimal happiness. Everything on this shoe is an improvement from the PureGrit 5. The upper features a more flexible mesh that will adhere to almost any foot shape while still feeling sturdy out on the trails. The shoe also includes a pocket on the tongue where laces can be stored, which conveniently keeps laces tied and out of the way.The Brooks DNA midsole on the PureGrit is nothing soft(if you're looking for a more cushioned option, check out the Cascadia or Caldera), but enough to keep you going and feeling energized. Transition in this shoe is extremely smooth and feels great throughout the entire gait cycle.And for all you wide footed people out there, this shoe has a spacious amount of forefoot room to keep your toenails on and your feet from falling asleep. Overall, I am very pleased with my PureGrit 6 shoes, and applaud Brooks for making such a great improvement on these shoes!",
110259,5,07/03/2017,"Best trail shoe ever Best trail shoe ever owned- have run in numerous brands- this shoe has the best feel for the trail, and  the most comfortable",
110260,2,12/14/2017,Not my best running shoe Shoe is quite stylish however if you plan on standing for long periods of time they wouldnt last too long before feeling uncomfortable. Their is not cushioning to keep your feet comfy. If you plan on running they are rather heavy and make my feets landing not as soft.,
110260,5,12/14/2017,Hands down the best shoe This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. It's impossible for me to go to another brand or style now that I've had these. I'm very flat footed and my feet used to hurt tremendously but these shoes help me in so many ways. It feels like you are walking on clouds.,
110260,5,11/29/2017,Most comfortable run ever ,

110260,4,10/10/2017,"Great kick around shoes I use this shoe as a kickaround shoe during the day and haven't actually run in it. It's a great shoe to wear around, very comfortable and stylish #reviewsweeps",

110260,2,09/17/2017,"Definitely NOT my favorite! I bought these for everyday use. They are not the most comfortable shoes. I wear men's shoes because I have wide feet, & the were too narrow for me. I can only wear these for small amounts of time. Really disappointed.",
110260,4,09/13/2017,Bought these shoes for my shoes ..he loves them! ,
110260,5,09/10/2017,Love my Brooks! These shoes look great and are comfortable as all get out!  Very happy with this pair and look forward to purchasing more in this style.  Hopefully more color options are introduced to this style.,
110260,5,08/28/2017,Perfect! ,
110260,5,08/25/2017,"Smooth Ride! I utilize these running shoes, three to five times, weekly and the ride is smooth!",
110260,5,08/24/2017,I would definetely buy more of these shoes. I have very bad feet issues and these are the only shoes I have been able to find that are comfortable on my feet. My foot doctor recommended them.,
110260,5,08/23/2017,"Incredibly versatile shoe! The shoe fits securely on foot, has an incredible ride under foot, and has an awesome aesthetically pleasing look. Great new shoe Brooks!",
110260,5,08/16/2017,"so far so good (35 miles) They feel pretty good so far. Somewhere between the Ghost and Launch. The Ghost has been my go-to for 5 years, but sometimes it feels too much shoe and I have also liked the Launch for shorter distances. So far I have used the Revel for runs between 4 and 14 miles and seems to hold well both in speed and comfort.",
110260,5,08/08/2017,"A Texan Goes to Washington DC in Revels I have been wearing the new Brooks Revel for the past 2 weeks, and I love them.  First, its looks gets me lots of compliments as it is a sharp looking shoe.  I have the black color, and it looks great and wears great.The Revel is very comfortable, and feels very supportive to my feet, and sure to my footing.  I wore it for my family's 5 day trip to Washington DC, where we stayed in a hotel on the National Mall, and as such I and my family walked 12 - 15 miles per day, visiting all the monuments and the Smithsonians, in 90 degree weather.  Often tired children weighing up to 60lbs ended up on my back for our hikes through DC.  The Revel kept my feet comfortable, and I felt that I had steady footing as I carried tired kiddos.  I received my new Revels from Brooks for free to try them out, and I could not be more appreciative of this opportunity.  In a week I am heading to Breckenridge, CO, to do more city street and trail hikes, and I am looking forward to how my feet are going to feel in the new Brooks Revel.",
110260,5,08/03/2017,I would buy these shoes again This is my 5th pair of Brooks. I have tried 3 styles. By far this is my favorite style. They are light and fit well. I like that they breath more than the other styles that I have used.,
110260,5,08/02/2017,"I WOULD buy these shoes again! I am 72 years old, unfortunately a ""retired"" runner.  I still buy running shoes(most always Brooks).  I do wear them walking, on the treadmill and just for general purposes.",
110260,4,07/26/2017,Thumbs up for Revel I am about a 30 mile a week runner who usually runs in the Brooks Launch but received a complimentary pair of Revel to try. I did an 8 mile and 10 mile run in them so far. Shoes are comfortable to run in and don't feel like a cushion shoe really. They do feel light to run in and could be used to train at any distance I think. I don't know the technical terms but toe box area is perfect and plenty of room but yet snug on the feet. As a long time hockey player I like my shoes to fit tight like a skate and they have that feel which is really nice.,
110260,4,07/17/2017,Not as wide as Transcends 3. I wouldn't say the toe box is wider than my transcends 3 but it is decent. I had to wear my thinner socks to make the toe box comfortable. I wore the shoe the whole day at Disneyland and I didn't feel any increase foot pain than normal. There is very slight arch support. I will give it a few more miles before I decide to return them but so far so good.,
110260,5,07/13/2017,"Another Winner for Brooks: The Revel! Brooks has become my favorite brand of running shoe. I have tried all of the other brands, but I always find myself going back to Brooks. In recent years I have loved running in the Launch and Flows. Over the past 14 years I have run 20 marathons and countless half marathons. As a result, I usually purchase 5-6 pairs of running shoes each year. While I'm not an expert on running shoes, I know what works and helps me to stay injury-free.On July 1st, Brooks launched a new model, Revel. I was fortunate to be asked by Brooks to test and give a review of their new model. To be fully transparent, Brooks provided me with a free pair of Revel and my only obligation was to run in the shoes and provide an honest assessment. Brooks did not influence the outcome of this review. This review was written after running approximately 50 miles in the Revel.AppearanceFor runners, appearance is not important so I will only comment briefly. The Revel are stylish and very nice looking. The upper construction is well done. This is one of the best looking running shoes on the market – not flashy but has a fashionable look and could be used for casual wear.Test RunsI felt it was important for me to do different types of run (e.g., Tempo, Intervals, Easy and Long) to give an overall rating or review on the Revel. Over the past couple of weeks I have tested the Revel on all of my runs.ComfortThe Revel are amazingly comfortable. The sizing was perfect. The uppers felt great. The soles were a little more firm than I expected, but they were very responsive and comfortable during my runs.QualityThe quality of the way the Revel were made, the way they look and the way they feel on your feet is outstanding.ConclusionThe Revel is the perfect neutral cushion shoe. It's sleek, with cushioned comfort. Great for an easy jog or for a long training run, I would highly recommend this shoe.",
110260,5,07/12/2017,"Revel Review Brooks sent me this shoe to wear test.  After three weeks of wear, I can honestly say that the Revel is a versatile shoe that continues the Brooks tradition of comfort, style, and high performance.  I biked, ran, walked, and weight trained while wearing the Revel and couldn't have been happier in terms of the support to my feet as well as the look of the shoe.  I would wear this shoe for any activity regardless of its intensity.  Thanks Brooks for leading the way in performance footwear!",
110260,5,07/11/2017,"Brooks Revel are super comfortable How do I begin?  I love them!  These are amazing shoes.  I am a marathon runner having run over 30 career marathons with the Brooks Adrenaline and Cadence being my two favorite shoes.  Normally I rotate my running shoes to my everyday world after having put 300-400 miles on them.  So with that being said, I had no interest or desire in purchasing a pair of Revel running shoes as I have plenty of old running shoes.  But then Brooks made me an offer to be a wear tester and try a complimentary pair of Revel running shoes.  I was somewhat skeptical but said sure, why not?The shoes arrived and I have to admit I immediately fell in love with them!  They are so comfortable and stylish.  I put them on to go for a walk around the neighborhood with my wife.  She immediately noticed them and commented how much she like them.  They don't look like a traditional running shoe but more closely resemble canvas sneakers.  I can easily wear them to the office and for a night out on the town.  The shoes feel just like running shoes.  Super comfortable.  The toe box is roomy and the arch support feels good.  No slip on the heel.  There is not quite as much support as my Adrenalins but still more than enough for everyday use.I was a bit unsure as to the sizing.  My normal shoe size is a 10 however with my running shoes I have found I need to go up half a size.  I did the same thing with the Revel shoes.  I found the shoes are true to size and probably could have kept with my usual shoe size.  But in the casual world, my socks are a little thicker than my running socks so it worked out.When my Revel shoes wear out, I will definitely be purchasing a new pair.",
110260,4,07/11/2017,"Good training shoe I have been wearing the Brooks Adrenaline exclusively for a long time.  I need the stability and I wear a custom orthodic with it due to previous foot issues.  The Adrenaline has been a wonderful shoe for training and racing.  I have tried alternatives but they have not worked out.  Perhaps because I have faithfully worn Brooks for so long, the good people there provided me with a free pair of the new Revel to wear test and review.  I love the look.  It is a shoe that I can walk in and wear to work after its running life is done.  The laces are way too long but that is so minor.  I think that the Revel is meant to be a less expensive model of stability shoe, but I cannot see any quality difference upon first look.  With my ordothics in it fits and feels great.  The only downside comes with the running.  Although it is comfortable and fits perfectly, it just does not have that push forward that I am used to, especially with a new pair of shoes.  My easy pace is slower than normal and I did a speed test of one mile and came up slower than expected.  I had planned to test them in a 10K race but after three training runs I decided that I would be faster in my Adrenalines.  Other new shoes I have tried always make me feel like I am being propelled forward, these Revels just do not do that.The remaining question is about how many running miles I can get out of the shoes.  The lower price is my only suspicion that they may not be as durable.  I will write another review if they fall apart after 100 miles, but I do not think that is going to happen.  In the mean time I will wear Revels for easy running days and enjoy having an alternative shoe that fits so well.",
110260,5,07/10/2017,"great shoe I have over 80 miles on the new Brooks REVEL neutral cushioned running shoe. I have run easy, tempo, speed work, and long runs in them.Looking at the shoes, the sole is relatively flat compared to the Brooks glycerin 14's I usually wear.  The toe box is all mesh for good ventilation and drying.  The laces have an interesting texture which I found helps keep them tied and tight.While running in the shoes, I found the ride both soft and responsive. I felt like I could clear my foot off the ground well in them.  I think that comes from the flatter/softer sole than I am used to.  It was a great shoe for speed work and tempo runs.  Looking at the price I think they are a great value. There isn't anything I would change or that I didn't like about the shoes. Overall, I would say a great neutral cushioned shoe for a good price.  Full disclosure: I was given a free pair from Brooks in exchange for an honest review.  I will be purchasing a pair to add to my glycerin rotation. It's a great shoe.",
110260,5,07/10/2017,"Neutrally stable with a responsive feel I have worn the Brooks Revel for 2 weeks logging  200+ miles on them on road, trail and treadmill.  The shoe has a simple, functional design. There is an ample toe box with few seams to irritate the foot; the top mesh is very comfortable. The Revel is neutrally stable with a responsive feel- not over cushioned nor  racing-flat hard. The shoe is flexible and comfortable. Revel's sole is of simple design and does not readily pick up rocks or mud; however, under wet conditions it tends to lose traction. The shoe performed well on tempo runs and intervals (sub 5:10); I did not experience blisters or hot spots that are common when working out with trainers. While the cushioning has compressed a bit after 200 miles it still gives a smooth ride. The upper remains in good shape with no tears or seams coming unstitched. The tread has held up remarkably well considering the variety of surfaces on which I have run, where usually I experience a shearing of tread..  I have been running in the Brooks Pure Flow shoes for several years and as a fore-foot striker prefer smaller heel-toe drop than in the Revel. The Revel is also heavier than the Pure Flow,  mostly as a result of more extensive cushioning.. Overall, I find this shoe to be a good training shoe and recommend it for runners who need a neutrally stable shoe and do not choose shoes based on flare.I was given this shoe to review by Brooks.",
110260,5,07/07/2017,"Great new shoe I received a complimentary pair of the new Brooks Revel a few days ago and have been running in them every day on a test basis.  The shoe seems to have more cushioning than my other favorites the Launch and the Ravenna.  Given the fact that I am over 50 and have been running for nearly 40 years, a little extra cushioning is good for my legs especially my knees.  The Revel is also very comfortable with a toe box upper that is made out of a material with a little more give than other Brooks shoes and it has a thicker, softer heel collar.  Overall, it is a very stylish shoe with a great fit that I plan to add to my rotation of regularly worn shoes.  And, when you are not wearing it on your daily run, it is also a versatile shoe that can be worn casually.",
110260,5,07/05/2017,"Great new shoe After being a loyal and happy Brooks running shoes customer for over three years, I was excited to try out the Revel.  Thank you to Brooks for sending me the Revel free of charge a week before the release.  I love the look of the shoe.  It looks modern and sleek.  The neutral cushion support make for a comfortable run.  I have already logged many miles in my new Brooks Revels.  I might have found my new favorite running shoe!",
110260,5,07/05/2017,"I think this is a great running shoe I am a 67 year old runner and still enjoy running immensely. But as the years have rolled by the wear and tear on my body have made me look for shoes that provide comfort and stability. I recently received a pair of Revels from Brooks to try free of charge and they are outstanding!!!They offer strong support but are very lightweight and they look great!My daughter is an ultra-distance runner and she ran with me on the 4th of July.Afterwards, she wanted to know all about the Revel.I ordered her a pair today.",
110260,5,07/03/2017,"Brooks Revel fit like a glove and are super comfortable, I was fortunate to be contacted by Brooks and asked to test their new running shoe, the Revel. I received the shoes for free and they simply asked me to wear them and submit a review.  Easy enough!I've worn Brooks Ghost for many years and I like the cushion.  I'm an older runner and I'm not necessarily thinking of speed, but of comfort.  It's nice to run without stress on my hips or legs. I don't like change so when I received the Revel shoes I examined them closely.The material on the top of the Revel seemed soft.  I was concerned with the space in the toe box width D (Medium) since I wear a 2E.  The heel cushion seemed adequate and I was anxious to try them.They fit like a glove.  The back of the shoe fit comfortably on the heel and held firm without any discomfort.  The toe box was perfect.  I felt plenty of room with absolutely no crowding of the toes.  The shoe was comfortable on the top with the new material finish.  I felt the arch support and it didn't feel excessive.  Now all I had to do is run in them!They are much lighter than my present running shoes.  I don't feel any weight and my running is easy.  The toes splay nicely and I don't have any issues with the toe box.  There is a lot of comfort with the bend of the shoe as I run.  They are flexible and light.  There is plenty of cushion and I don't have any aftereffects of pain or stress.  I simply feel very comfortable wearing these Revel shoes.I've run with low cushion track shoes before and the Revel feel like them but with a bit more cushion and support.  I've been able to run a little faster with these with no additional effort. They are very easy to run with a mid-strike forward. I look forward to running with the Revel in future races as well as local group runs.",
110261,4,12/16/2017,Wish I had stuck with the Beast Not many shoes come in my size so I was excited to try this one.  I also have the Beast edition and it fits perfect- This one is made a little smaller though,
110261,4,12/14/2017,For walking (4Xdaily) these shoes easy on my knees & hips. Adrenalin's Didn't have knee-hip support that my Addictions have since started with Addiction 7!,

110261,4,11/14/2017,"Pretty good 'My third pair of Brooks shoes, all this model.  I wish they would quit changing it (and charging more for each new model).  It's a good shoe.  It lasts.  I wish they would offer all models in black in addition to all the garish colors.  They're pushing the margins of ""good value"" with their pricing, but if quality holds up I'll continue to buy Brooks shoes.",

110261,1,10/26/2017,"Bad changes! I have worn Brooks' Addiction for more than 15 years. I have severe plantar fasciitis and the Brooks Addiction was the perfect treatment. Due to the structure of my feet, I required a ""collar"" or ""neck"" as well as pronation control. I tried Brooks Beast two years ago and my feet hurt so bad with the Beast so I went back to the Addiction.  Looks like Brooks is trying to get rid of their Addiction customers, so I will be looking and shopping elsewhere.  Too bad... I can truly say that the Brooks Addiction (pre-11) was the best running shoe I've ever had.  Not sure why Brooks is trying to look like Nike.  I hate Nike.",
110261,4,10/24/2017,"Best fit, not so good color Most comfortable version yet.  Blackish color not as preferred as earlier more silver/grey color.",
110261,5,10/18/2017,Best shoe EVER I have very narrow feet and these shoes width is perfect and I've never had a pair of shoes where the narrow width actually for so perfectly. I can feel the difference in the support the minute I put them on. I have plantar facsiatis  and they immediately gave me support and improved my foot pain. I typically where a 11.5 b width in mens. These shoes run about a 1/2 size too small so had to go up to a 12 B in mens and they fit Perfect!,

110261,1,10/06/2017,I probably won't buy another pair of the Addiction shoe ever I'm switching over to the Dyad because the last 3 pairs of Adicttion have been problematic. The first two with the two wearing through and the most recent pair causing a lot of pain on the top of my foot.,
110261,2,09/15/2017,"Too Wide This version of the addiction feels much wider / higher volume than the past.  It no longer fits my flat foot at all, even with inserts and trying the narrowest size available.  Possibly because of the sloppy fit, doesn't feel nearly as supportive as past models either.",
110261,2,09/11/2017,"End of the Addiction This is the first ""update"" to the addiction line that I'm aware of where they changed the last of the shoe.  It's advertised as ""roomier"" which translates to sloppier and less supportive fit for those of us with narrow, flat feet (which the addiction has always been touted as being perfect for.)  Only positive is that they've lengthened the tongue a bit to make it more reasonable, but otherwise, these are uglier and worse feeling than all other addictions I've owned.",
110261,3,09/09/2017,"Colors stink! C'mon Brooks I get the all black model but where is the light colorway with the ""Brooks blue""? And for godsakes enough with the ugly dated grey  medial post coloring. If the gals version was all white why not the men's? Still look like dated old men shoes. Can't seem to get out of your own way to increase sales.",
110269,5,12/27/2017,"L O V E these shoes! I was looking for a balance between my Launch 4's and my Ghost 10's. I wanted more cushion that my Launches offer but I wanted more spring than my Ghost's offer. I found the perfect balance in the Levitate. I tried them on and literally ran out of the store for a 5 miler and they felt already broken in. 2 days later I ran 13.5 in them and again, they felt great. They provide excellent cushion and still have a great energy return. I love my Launch 4's for shorter (3-5 miles) runs and love my Ghost 10's for anything longer, but I would feel very comfortable running anything from a 5k to a half marathon in these. Feel, transition, weight, breath-ability, everything I look for in a shoe, this one gives it to me. Honestly, the price scared me away at first, but I finally caved and they're worth every dime. I love these shoes and I highly recommend them!",
110269,5,12/27/2017,"Love these shoes - but i destroy the heals I love these shoes but i have destroyed the heal tread after 200 miles. I bought another pair wanting to make sure i can get them to have as a backup for the race i'm training for. I had the Glycerin which the heal tread was completely gone and well into the heal foam after only 100 miles. I'm hard on shoes, but seems like the buttery feel i love with the Brooks comes at the price of low tread life for me. That said, don't buy them if you are hard on your heal strike and want a shoe that's worth the value in its longevity.",
110269,4,12/24/2017,I love the looks but it runs too narrow. Great looking shoe. The insole was thicker and more comfortable than most. I have the Beast which fits great and is super comfortable.  The Levitate is too narrow. It needs to be available in wide.,

110269,5,12/14/2017,"It is a great shoe I wanted to try these out and I am glad I did.

110269,5,11/30/2017,Levitate review  Great shoe to run in The Levitate shoe was better than I expected.  I expected a spring but I did not expect this amount of spring.  Breaking in period was very low.  I wore the shoe 3 weeks before my first half marathon and I experienced no foot problems and no blisters.  This is the best shoe that Brooks has ever created.,
110269,5,11/29/2017,"Best new Brooks running shoes! First neutral shoe I've tried. I have trained and raced in the Ravennas for the past 7 years. The Levitates are amazing: super energy return, fast, light enough, and provide just enough ankle stability support for me. I couldn't be happier with these and it is only generation one!!!",
110269,5,11/28/2017,"Definitely worth the money! Love this shoe, just wish I could get it in a wide style as it is a bit narrow. Still a great shoe though!",

110269,5,11/22/2017,"Very comfortable and responsive, Love it Juat as comfortable as all other high end running shoes if not more comfortable yet a lot lighter and is great for both distance runs and tempo runs",
110269,5,11/20/2017,Great shoe! Will definitely purchase again. I have always run in ASICS and decided to try out a new shoe. Very pleased with the Brooks Levitate after a couple weeks and over 50 miles logged. It feels light on your feet with a lightweight and breathable upper. It also feels a bit stretchy so it conforms nicely yet lets your foot move naturally while running.,
110269,2,11/20/2017,"I would not buy this product again. I've been wearing Brooks shoes for ever. Have had several pairs of Ghost/GTS/Beast/Glycerin. 2 weeks ago, I opted for the Levitate to try something new. They fit like a glove, are super comfortable, wonderful to lounge around/walk in. Start to run however, and I found its like running through mud. The absorption in the sole appears to suck any power out of each footstrike making my usual 8-10mile run feel far, far longer. I've worn them on 3 occasions and I simply cannot tolerate the lack of feel coming back from the shoe nor the lack of power transfer. For the first time ever, I'll be taking Brooks up on their 90d return policy and reverting back to my usual Brooks choice.",
110269,5,11/19/2017,"Great shoe for a longer distance, slower pace. I grew up in the Launch 4's (favorite shoe), which i still use for shorter-mid distances. I tried the Levitates, for my longer distance, slower paced days. Though a bit heavier, the comfort, and cushion, with an ""already broken in"" feel made these a close second for me.I notice a great energy return, and arch support, which feels great in later miles.",
110269,5,11/18/2017,Perfect! I run 20 miles + a week and have High arch feet . It's a struggle finding the perfect fit. Iv tyred the glycerin 15 and a few asics before that all of them we good but I either blacked out nails or my arches hurt after 6 miles . The levitate is perfect and my search is finally over,
110269,5,11/18/2017,"Kudos to Brooks These are great running shoes. Despite not being the lightest out there, somehow you just don't feel the weight. Energy response is the best I've ever felt. Only complain is perhaps a being a little narrow but after a few uses they feel fine. Bought my first pair when they launched and loves them so much that I bought my second one already.",
110269,4,11/17/2017,"Quality Shoe, But be Careful of Size Quality shoe, but it seems to run a bit bigger than the pair of Brooks shoes I replaced with these.  My old ones were an 11, and fit perfectly; so I ordered these in an 11 and they feel a little bit too big.  So, bottom line, great shoe, but consider ordering a half size smaller than usual if you purchase.",

110269,5,11/13/2017,Definitely will buy again I have been running in Adrenaline's for years based on stability because of a high arch and tried the new Levitate model. Couldn't be happier! Great stability in a lighter shoe Definitely would recommend,
110269,5,11/13/2017,"Incredible Shoes I typically run 20 - 30 miles a week. I ran in a 15K shortly after getting my Levitates. I PR'd it. Actually, ran it 20 secs off of my normal pace. Was it the shoes? or was it just everything came together? The shoes definitely contributed!",
110269,5,11/10/2017,"Love it...... I have been an Asics die hard for 42+ years... and finally decided to venture out.. The Levitate fits to my true to size foot, is very responsive, it maybe on the heavier side but you would not know it.. It hugs your foot nicely.  In my younger days I was a 2:28 marathoner, 5K-10K race pace was 5:10 pace.. I am still very competitive at the age of 65 and have over 100,000 miles on this body..

Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever ran in.,

110269,5,11/07/2017,"yes I started running with the Ghost 7 years ago. I switched to the Glycerine about 4 years ago for more cushioning. I've been running about 3 miles/day for 2 weeks in the Levitate. So far I love the extra cushioning and light weight. The upper is soft and really comfortable. I do wear custom orthotics, so I like the neutral support of the shoe.Overall, I'm happy I switched.",

It's not a horrible shoe, it's just heavy and somewhat cumbersome.  Was really expecting more of a responsive feel, especially for the price and marketing hype  For the price I will simply stick with the Glycerin for future purchases.",
110269,5,11/04/2017,"Very lightweight, almost unnoticeable on your foot. I run on a concrete floor. It feels great, only if you do exercises where you move left or right with your feet, it feels a bit slippery inside of the shoe. They are meant for running mostly.",
110269,4,11/04/2017,"So fresh Strava didn't even have them as a shoe choice. In just a few runs this shoe has become my go to for just about any type of run. I am a bigger runner (175) but I have been able to use these for long runs, short fartleks, and even tempos. Will likely become my new marathon kicks",

Would usually not run in a brand new shoe (let alone a marathon) but I did and these Levitate's were literally the most comfortable and responsive shoe I'd ever run at distance on the road. They hold tight to your foot, are not bulky and allow for a natural, comfortable stride. As luck would have it, two days after returning back to Colorado, our puppy found and destroyed the shoes....but I liked them so much I bought another pair. Highly recommended for any runner looking for a high performance, responsive shoe.",

110269,5,10/31/2017,True to the name This shoe is very comfortable. It is aptly named Levitate as it is light and airy. I have no reservations recommending this shoe.,
110269,1,10/31/2017,LEVITATES ARE TOO HEAVY Bottom line...this shoe is TOO HEAVY! If you're a performance athlete or even a recreational runner this shoe is a wreck and has a negative impact on running economy.,

Even more than my Pure Flow 3s which I went through 4 pairs of before I couldn't get them anymore. True feel, great laces and thin tongue help these grasp your foot tightly but comfortably. Great support and soft sole help your glide through the miles. I'll be going through many pairs of these. Great job, Brooks.",
110269,5,10/29/2017,"one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn Absolutely would recommend. As a 220 lb runner, this will be my absolute go to half marathon shoe. I will see if it's enough for a full in my case. Usually I run in Transcends for a full because of form breakdown in later stages.",

110269,4,10/23/2017,Made for runnining The Levitate is a beauty visually! It is like the Jaguar of running shoes.

110269,5,10/23/2017,"Extra Bounce I usually run in Hokas and have been very hesitant to run in any other shoe. I've tried Altra's and Asics, both have caused injuries. I've only taking for 2 runs at the moment, but I like them. They seem to give that extra bounce that I felt the original Hoka Cliftons had. I'll hope move these into my normal running shoe rotation. My only complaint and it's with every shoe, is I have high arches and the liners are useless to me.",
110269,5,10/23/2017,Great shoe - best I've had in a while! ,
110269,5,10/23/2017,Brooks is my running shoe for 40yrs+ The platform is spectacular!  Best yet for everyday runs. Hyperion still fav for speed work. The upper feels a little loose compared to most models but is still good.,
110269,5,10/22/2017,"Excellent Shoe so FAR I have run in this shoe four times...all fairly short runs with a total of 19 miles so far.  I overpronate with flat feet to boot and these shoes are not rated as support shoes but I have not had any issues.  The shoes are comfortable and have enjoyed the springy, responsive ride that is advertised for this shoe.  The material of the shoe is a nice add.  I have a mix of three Books shoes (the other two are Adrenaline GTS 17 and Ghost 10 LE).  In comparison, I have noticed a bit more support in my Adrenaline as advertised and the Ghost are extremely comfortable.  However, I think the Levitate is a great add to my running shoe rotation, so far.",
110269,5,10/22/2017,Great shoes. So far they seem like awesome shoes.  I have only had them a couple of weeks but so far so good.,
110269,5,10/22/2017,My new favorite I've bent running in the Revennas for the last couple years. The Levitate gives me the stability I need with a much more cushioned response. It is noticeable lighter too,

If you like the Glycerin shoe, you'll probably like this as well. The Levitate is:-Neutral-Great toe box-Cushions the run-Aesthetically better looking than the Glycerin...however, I find it does not hug my arch the same way the Glycerin does.Final recommendation: TRY IT!     I like the shoe. I will likely go back to Glycerin next year, but I'll definitely keep the Levitate as an everyday shoe.",

In trying to get the rebound they wanted felt it was to stiff got 40 mi. on them so far should be broke in by now. Was impressed with traction this shoe has on wet surface and should get a lot of life out of them. Downfall again, need to have extra shoes, feet get sore from poor cushioning. A great looking shoe!",

I just felt these shoes were a little heavy and felt sloppy. They felt sloppy because the weight is mostly on the bottom of the shoe, so it just felt like with the light weight top and heavy bottom, it was just uncomfortable. Also, these were terrible on wet surfaces. I slid a lot when running on a paved trail after rain. Again, shoe isn't bad but for the cost, better are out there (i.e glycerin or Cadence).",

I bought the shoe to run The New York and St Jude Marathons in. I had bought t Ghost 10's direct from Brooks before they were available and had worn those out by late September, knowing I would have to buy before the races I decided on the Levitate from all the emails I'd received from Brooks and they had never let me down before. Mistake on my part. the shoe is uncomfortable and feels heavy on runs.

Just finished my first marathon in these bad boys and besides the Glycerin I wouldn't have picked a different shoe. The knit upper is super comfy and supportive. It feels both snug and nonrestrictive. The cushion is just as soft as the Newest iteration of the Glycerin except it gives you that extra spring in your step. In the looks department this shoe is great the silver on the sole makes this shoe really standout. I have the white version and it looks very clean, sharp, and futuristic. I typically run in the Ghost and Glycerin but I feel like if you enjoy any Brooks shoe you will definitely like the Levitate.

110269,3,10/19/2017,"Still Unsure My two most recent running & racing shoes are the Nike LunarEpic Flyknit 2 and the Adidas Supernova.  Both 10MM Drops and both very comfortable.  Prior to that about 5 pairs of Brooks Launch.  I run 40-70 miles per week and compete in marathons (2:40-2:55 finishing time for most races). I just completed the Columbus marathon this past Sunday and raced in the levitate.  It was much more firm and heavy than what I am expected. I bought the shoes about 1.5 weeks before the run due to the surprisingly quick wear out in the Nikes so a trusted brand like Brooks was preferred.  Sold on the levitate over the Supernova and Cloudflow, I put in a few long walks and a few runs prior to the race to gauge feel and thought the firmness with go away once broken in but it is just the way the shoe is. I did not think the weight would make a difference from the Nike's but after 10-11 miles the heaviness of the levitate could be felt and made the remaining 15 miles much less enjoyable.  That all said I like the shoes potential and believe going down a half size to a 12.5 will help a ton but the store I bought mine from did not offer a 12.5 so I will have to return and order direct. I am hoping it is just an adjust period and a need for the correct size because the shoe is premium quality and has promise.  Updates to come once recovered from the marathon and in the right size shoe.",
110269,5,10/17/2017,"Best Sneaks on the Market Right Now Energy losses in stride is significantly minimized compared to previous designs. Your friends will love them and you will get many compliments. They work great with slacks and are great daily drivers.This is my first pair of Brooks and first pair of new sneaks in approx. 6-7 years. Huge difference!The only stipulations I have for these shoes are the laces and shinny sole. The laces are flat like and need to be laced up untangled and flat on the shoe to reduce wear. The sole is very shinny and therefore scuffs and curbing are much more noticeable! So be careful and take care of these shoes. Great shoes, but too nice to be ruined from intensive workouts. I would recommend these as daily drivers for business casual settings, school, or walking on clean streets. #ReviewSweeps",

And then I realize in trying these on that they are just NOT LIGHT. Yes, they are comfortable; yes, they would probably have nice energy return...if I could run in them. But 11 oz? That's a non-starter for me. Maybe this shoe will suit runners who are used to a heavier shoe, but I'll wait for the version that's light enough for my running gait.",

110269,5,10/10/2017,"Great Shoe - wonderful transition for Ravenna/Launch loyalis I am a former Brooks ID member, and was also part of the Fanatics program. I have been a decade-long Brooks fan and was excited to get am email from Brooks asking if I would wear test a new shoe that had yet to be released.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I did receive this pair of shoes for free as a pre-release. I am a light pronator that does 100% of my runs in Ravenna or Launch, depending on the distance and workout plan.   The first thing you notice when you put them on is the signature Brooks feel. They feel amazing walking around the living room.  Like the Launch, there are no pressure points. You don't feel like the shoe is forcing you to do anything your foot doesn't do for itself.  My first run in these was a hill workout on single-lane gravel roads in the woods of southern Indiana.  After a quarter of a mile, I got lost in conversation with my running partner and completely forgot I was wearing brand new shoes.  To me this is one of the best compliments a new shoe can receive.  There was no break-in period. They just felt great.  The silver soles look mean as hell and the mesh upper breathes like a champ.  The next morning I did.a slower pace (~7:00/mile) over some paved road and some packed gravel.  This route also had some pretty mean hills.  We did and out and back where the out was primarily uphill and the back was flying downhill.  I am a larger runner, upwards of 175 lbs, so downhills can beat me up.  The heel fit and cushioning on these is fantastic, and handled the downhills like a champ with no slippage whatsoever.    PROS: amazing curbside feel, you will feel instantly at home if you run in Brooks now, cushioning for days without being a bulky shoe. CONS: with the lightweight mesh upper (which I love), I worry about long term durability. Time will tell.  Cost - I will probably be swapping out Ravenna for Levitate long term, which means an extra 40 bucks a pop.  OVERALL: a fantastic shoe for neutral and even mild pronators like myself. Love it",

110269,5,10/05/2017,"A Bit Heavy, But Seriously Innovative Cushioning I typically run in Adidas boost shoes: Boston 6 for quicker pace, and last year's Supernova Glide for everyday training. Given the marketing surrounding the cushioning tech in the Levitate, I was very intrigued by this shoe. I think that Brooks did something genius by encasing their new cushioning in a TPU shell. While the Glide 8 could feel a little sloppy at times, the ride on the Levitate is extremely smooth, cushioned, and responsive without being obtrusive. If you want to run faster, the shoe will give back without feeling awkward, but at its heart this shoe really likes to cruise. The single density sole is also great for transitions. My only complaint is that we're now in an era where shoes are getting a lot lighter while improving their performance/cushioning properties. The Levitate may not have been considered heavy 3-5 years ago, but it is a heavy shoe by today's standards. That said, the materials and ride are superlative.",
110269,5,10/03/2017,"A Great & Innovative New Shoe from Brooks Full Disclosure: I received a complimentary pair of these from Brooks for the purposes of wear-testing and providing public feedback. The only string attached was that I post a couple of honest reviews on certain websites. To be sure, these words and views are entirely my own. My first impression of these shoes is that they look great—fully modern but understated and not too flashy. Upon trying them on, I noticed right away that they feel no less good on the foot. The upper is soft and slightly stretchy, but glove-like and supportive. I'm not sure it's advertised as being seamless, but it definitely felt that way. Breathability is high, and my only potential concern, given the lack of overlays, is how durable it would be over the longer term. Now, the real test: how well does this attractive and comfortable shoe actually perform? Evidently, Brooks has been working long and hard to engineer what they believe is a revolutionary new midsole, touting it for its top-of-the-line energy return. While I cannot personally compare this shoe to those of its competitors with similar aspirations, I can say, after a few 9-12 mile test runs, that it is remarkably responsive, even springy, upon footfall.  I suppose the main goal of any midsole is finding the right balance between cushioning, feel for the ground, and energy return, and this one gets that just right; but the emphasis on the latter is clear, and really shows to its credit.  If you're looking for a little extra bounce in your stride, then this shoe will not disappoint. The proof will be in the pudding over time, but I'm very impressed by the Levitates thus far. I've been running exclusively in various iterations of the Launch for years, but these shoes, which offer a noticeably different experience, will now be entering the rotation. They are a bit heavier, and less connected to the ground, but they are still plenty nimble and flexible, with a good heal-to-toe transition. Overall, a great debut from Brooks!",
110269,5,10/02/2017,"Great Introduction to the Brooks Lineup When Brooks contacted me with the offer of trying a complementary pair brand new neutral cushion shoe, the Levitate, I couldn't wait to sign up. Right out of the box the Levitate looks great. Shoe color and design are quite important to me, and this shoe did not disappoint. The silver midsole is eye caching. Quality shoe laces too. This small detail is more important than people thing. As for the fit, I am a size 10 and a normal width. The Levitate is true to size charts, so on size alone the Levitate is like other Brooks that I have owned. The heel collar is one piece which eliminates chaffing and unwanted rubbing during use. I don't ever run without socks, but you could with this shoe. The knit upper gives the shoe a snug fit at the same time allowing just the right amount of movement. I was not sure how I would like this feature, but after one run, I was sold. It was comfortable and responsive to my foot movement. The weather has been hot, but this fabric seems to dry quicker, which is another bonus. I am very particular about the weight of my shoes. I prefer shoes weigh under 10 ounces, even for everyday running. This is evident by the fact that I have owned 35 pairs of Brooks Launch since 2009. The Levitate gave me some concerns with weighing in at just over 11 ounces. Those concerns were gone after one run. The new DNA AMP material is fast and light. You can run fast in this shoe. This new material combines with the sole pattern (arrow design) really does allow for quick transitions. The Levitate is a fast shoe! I am sold. The new Brooks Levitate delivers on its promises.

As a wearer of running shoes with more support (the Ravenna has been my running shoe of choice for many years), the Levitate is not the type of shoe I would usually choose.  I was pleasantly surprised how good it felt.  The shoe has a very soft heel, a snug but flexible toe box, and a sole with a design and material that I have never seen before.  The sole felt very flexible, like it was giving slightly as I ran.  Overall the shoe felt great, no rubbing or chafing anywhere.  I found myself naturally striding off of the mid-foot and even the ball of my foot, which is usually difficult for me to do.  The shoe seemed to be propelling me forward as well.  I tried both a long, easy run and a fast paced speed work run, and the Levitate performed great for both.   I am looking forward to running further in the Levitate and highly recommend that others that have enjoyed the Ravenna or the Ghost to give it a try.",

110269,5,09/30/2017,"Excellent new shoe Upon first putting this sneaker on, the mesh upper material was SO comfortable.   It fit snug yet not constricting an any area of my foot.   After a few minutes, I actually couldn't feel the upper, it was almost like wearing a slipper !   The laces were perfect length.   The toebox width was spot on for my foot.   Initial response on the mid-sole was positive.   I could feel a soft, cushion base to the foot bed.   I am a heel-striker and I am coming from the Adrenaline GTS with a larger drop than the Levitate so it took some time to get used to less drop.   After a few miles I was comfortable with the drop, my pace was actually quicker than I expected.   My first run was a steady state 10K run and then a recovery type 10K run the next day and noticed I was going faster without thinking about pace during both runs.    On the recovery run, I had to concentrate on slowing down.   I ran on pavement and in dry conditions so I was not able to test traction.   The weight of this shoe felt 'bottom heavy' compared to the GTS.     Since the upper was so comfortable, I think the mid-sole felt heavier.I did go up a ½ size on this shoe compared to my normal sizing.   Looking forward to trying a longer (10+) mile run in these to see how my feet feel after a longer time in this shoe.   Full disclosure, I was sent a free pair of Levitate to test.",
110269,5,09/30/2017,"Your New Rocket Ship is Here! WOW!  I opened the Brooks box and first thing I notice is the midsole. The shiny, silver, geometric design  -  accentuated and coming together in the midfoot with the powerful stamp of DNA.AMP. The seamless upper reminds me of a one piece glove, contoured to the foot.  Beautiful design… beautiful shoe….they look like Rocket Ships!   I quickly slid on the shoes.  Perfect fit, no pinch, no gap, no rub.  Toe box feels and looks right (vented, stich less), heel counter feels and looks right.  Laces don't bind (I lace my shoes tightly), 3 upper eyelet options allowing me to perfectly lace configure.  Feels right, looks right.  And then I stood up – and took a step.  W O W!  Seriously! Cushion for sure – but with a responsiveness that I am not used too.  As I walk around on the hardwood floors, my feet feel alive.  ME:  Age 50, Male, 6 foot, 144 pounds – running since 13, past collegiate runner and pro running circuit.  I run a lot.  100+ miles per week.  I demand and expect my running shoe to be my partner.  I always train in neutral shoes and go through a pair a month (500 miles, wash and donate). Brooks sent me a complimentary pair asking me to test the Levitate as part of their wear test program and provide objective feedback. This isn't a problem as I am always searching for the perfect running shoe.  To that, I want to help in any way possible to find my 'solemate'.   Runs 1-4, 52 combined dry and wet miles and from the first to last step, this shoe is very different.  Fully integrated with me, my stride, the speed and beyond responsive. It is really cushioning my landing with the right amount of impact absorption, but reflecting the energy back to my legs. This shoe, is the real deal.  You can see and feel all of the engineering that has gone into producing this model.  Brooks has really outdone themselves with the Levitate. I can see all types of runners falling in love with this shoe – like I have.  Levitate is my new shoe of choice.  This is my new Rocket Ship!",

Some are too plush, and don't facilitate a ride that connects you with your stride. The other extreme is a low drop for the sake of a low drop that does you no favors on longer runs. Brooks hits the mark here for performance-oriented runners, who have to sift through marketing sizzle to find the steak. My only knock is the price tag!

110269,5,09/29/2017,"Comfy and good heel cushioning Brooks sent me a pair (gratis) to try and review. The last few years I have been wearing the Launch by Brooks. They sent me a shoe 1/2 bigger than I normally get and it fit fine. I might have able to live with my normal size too, but I wouldn't want it any bigger than 1/2 size bigger than normal. I have put about 25 or so miles on it on four different runs trying a variety of surfaces (asphalt, concrete, dirt trail, trail with a million tree roots, and some gravel paths. I tried some hills as well.   My very first impression was how comfortable it was just putting them on. I thought it might be too warm, but it wasn't. The weather has been upper 80s and humid and it was fine. So my thinking is it will be ok in the winter too as far as cold and wind. Second impression - the laces were appropriately long (some shoes I find the laces are a bit too short even though I don't lace to last hole). As for colour, they sent me blue. You can't wrong with blue in my book. Now for the running. I found these to be what I considered a pretty cushioned shoe (more than the Launch, for instance), but not like some shoes where you are not even sure your feet are hitting the ground and you have to look down to check. The heel in particular had the extra cushioning, which for me I liked. My guess is this shoe is a tad heavier than the Launch but not a heavy shoe. Sort of medium. But heck, with shoes getting lighter and lighter even the heavy shoes of today aren't really heavy. The shoe had a nice response. Not overly bouncy, but I felt like it gave me energy. I feel like my legs were definitely less sore than usual after my runs.  I had no problem gripping on all surfaces - including rocks and turns on soft dirt going downhill.  I was not able to test it in rain (or snow/ice).  The disappointment: despite the name of the shoe, I have not been able to figure out how to levitate. No instructions in the box either on that matter. The verdict: I will be running in them.",

110271,5,12/26/2017,I've been a Brooks customer for years. I always buy a half size larger than normal. Having a choice of widths always provides a good fit.,
110271,5,12/22/2017,love the new design ,
110271,5,12/20/2017,Always a great shoe I can't run consistently anymore due to bad plantar fasciitis but I'm so accustomed to wearing running shoes -they're great for resistance and other trainIng.,
110271,5,12/19/2017,Would buy this product...ALWAYS! Training for Marathons (Full & Half). Use shoes to run about ~20+ miles a week.,
110271,5,12/19/2017,"I would buy this product Comfortable fit, and with an added insole pad the shoe has a cushioned spring like feel , which makes for less wear and tear on the knees. I would have been happier with a brighter shade of red.",
110271,2,12/18/2017,Wish I'd gotten a size or width larger. ,
110271,3,12/16/2017,"Only shoe that is sized right This was the only pair of shoes that were true to the 4e width. I wanted different shoes with better colors and styles but not available in 4e that would fit. I only walk in these and I am on my feet all day on concrete. By the end of the day my feet are feeling it, wish they had more cushion. My feet are always hot and these have good ventilation so that helps. Please offer more choices in shoes and colors for fat feets",
110271,5,12/16/2017,"Awesome! I have been running in Brooks Adrenaline for 13 years and was somewhat concerned about the changes made to the GTS 18.  Now that I have run in them, I love the new feel.  It took a few runs to get use to the slight change in material/style, but I prefer the flexibility and lighter weight of the GTS 18 to prior models.  I have only been running in them for a few weeks, so I cannot comment yet on the durability.",
110271,4,12/16/2017,"My favorite Brooks shoe to date! I wish I had discovered that the Adrenaline came in narrow width before now. I've had multiple pairs of the Addiction, which seemed to be the only shoe Brooks made in a narrow width. The Addictions were okay, but always had some slight flaw(toe box too short, or too narrow). The Adrenaline shoe was comfortable from the first time I put them on. There was no heel chafing, no tightness in the toe box, and I've been wearing them virtually every day, since I got them. My routine walking route is a little over 2.5 miles, and I do it 4-6 days/week. I used the Adrenalines the day after I received them, and have continued ever since, with no problems.",
110271,5,12/15/2017,"Comfortable. I bought 2pr. Glad to have new shoes. Wearing Adrenaline since '10, sizing has fluctuated. Originally wore 9M consistently until '16. Now wear 8.5M.",
110271,5,12/14/2017,"support and quality great feeling since the first steps, the one piece upper perfectly adapts to the feet giving a comfortable feeling. support pronation well structured as normal for the adrenaline serie. The soft upper lets the foot moving in the shoe, therefore a right lace up is necessary. not optimal grip on slippery surfaces but that's a common thing for all the Brooks I used.",
110271,5,12/12/2017,Somehow brooks has improved their adrenaline show even more ,
110271,5,12/12/2017,"Awesome shoe, love the upgraded upper ",
110271,5,12/11/2017,Great product. ,
110271,5,12/11/2017,"Great Great Great It all depends on one's anatomy, I suppose; for me, these are the best Adrenaline GTS yet. I currently own three 17s and a 16, in addition to the 18, and I welcome the extra softness at landing provided by the latter.",
110271,5,12/11/2017,Best shoes ,
110271,1,12/08/2017,No Next time I'll buy a Wider size I would order a wider size for example I ordered 2E  it feels tight .  next time I will order 4E.,
110271,1,12/07/2017,"Nice Looking-Poor Stability Going back 3 years since I bought by first GTS 14's, I have bought over 30 pairs of Adrenalines due to my over pronation problems.  My shoes wear out very quickly and I am forced to get new ones frequently. They were always the shoe for me.  When I saw that they had redesigned it, I was happy to buy the GTS 18.  This model, although better looking does not offer the stability of it's predecessors.  After 15 minutes, my feet were in the same pain that an overpronator feels when they walk in regular shoes.  I now will buy whatever GTS 17's that are left out there since I don't know if Brooks will correct this issue in the GTS 19's.  Bottom line Brooks, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Learn from other sneaker companies that keep the same models around forever for those that are used to having the right fit for them.",
110271,4,12/06/2017,"Good shoe - 17 felt better The 18 is good, looks better than the 17. I own the 17, and find it to be more supportive and comfortable. The 18 looks better, but felt light and not as supportive. The lacing structure felt lighter and weaker, whereas the 17 has a nice thick secure fit. I would recommend brooks build the 17 model and make it look like the 18. Not a huge fan of light mesh uppers....don't think they will last as long.",
110271,5,12/06/2017,Awesome shoe I have been running with Adrenalines for years. This latest version has been very reliable and comfortable.,
110271,5,12/05/2017,Comfy shoes and are great! These are very comfy shoes.  I bought them because i work on my feet a lot and needed shoes because i have plantar fasciitis.  They feel very comfy for me and I'm glad i made this purchase.,
110271,5,12/05/2017,Comfortable and light shoe - would purchase again. ,
110271,5,12/03/2017,"Excellent shoe for a 5K!!! This is a very light and stable shoe.  It's been excellent for 5K and 4 mile runs.  For 10k's and above, I like the Brooks Glycerin which offers a little more cushion.",
110271,5,12/02/2017,Amazing ,
110271,4,11/28/2017,"Great shoe! Great fit, very comfortable, the only complaint is that they squeak when I walk or run in them. My old pair of brooks did not, not sure if it's a change in the sole setup.",
110271,5,11/25/2017,Finally!! Last ones I bought were GTS 16's. Terrible. Hated running in them. All kinds of problems I've never had before. I run between 10-15miles per week. I've been wearing GTS since the 7's. These 18's are easily the best ones I've had since my favorite 12's- which I literally put 1000miles on. (Yes I know). If you severely overpronate then I can see how you'd prefer the older versions. These provide me sufficient support in the ankle area yet don't crush my wide feet in the toe box. Incredibly comfortable! Always remember to buy 2 pairs of shoes that work for you once you find them.,
110271,5,11/24/2017,Best version. I've been wearing Adrenaline since the 10s. This is the best version I've worn.,
110271,4,11/24/2017,Love the change. Need more color options in extra wide Bulkier than years past but more comfortable. Would like to see more color options in extra wide.,
110271,5,11/22/2017,"Great shoe, improvement over the gts 17 With flat feet I need a lot of support and the adrenaline GTS definitely provides it.  No overlays on this shoe makes it more breathable and comfortable.  Love them!",
110271,3,11/21/2017,"Fashion over function. I initially ordered the GTS Adrenaline 17, but soon realized the new 18 version was coming out. I now have my hands with the two versions, so here's my take on both. The 18's look and feel amazing, very modern and sleek, but as for the stability and support when running, it sadly does not compare with the older GTS 17. Sure the 17 look ""uglier"", but it's design is like that for a reason - it offers a noticeable increase in stability.  I bought this for my overpronation and flat feet, so the GTS 17 is the winner here. If style and comfort is your priority, the GTS 18 will make you happy.",
110271,5,11/20/2017,Best adrenalines ever I've been running with adrenaline fir years and this is so far by mist the best shoe ever.  I was going to switch show because I didn't like the arch in the GTA 17.  But then these came along. So I'm now staying with brooks for at least my next marathon,
110271,5,11/18/2017,"Best GTS shoe yet Best GTS shoe yet, I have always bought brooks GTS running shoes starting with 11, 12, all the way to this one the 18. Best one yet most comfortable and they fixed the oversized Young's issue from the 17. Great shoe",
110271,5,11/17/2017,"Best Shoe Ever I have been wearing Brooks Adrenaline GTS for about five years.  I bought the GTS 18 and my foot has never been in a better shoe.  The cushion and the support are wonderful.  I have a narrow foot so I bought the B width and it fits my foot snugly with enough room in the toe box.  I have run a couple of 5k distance and and will have no trouble running half half marathons.  Thank you Brooks for having a shoe that makes running a joy.  Like they say, ""Run Happy""!",
110271,2,11/16/2017,"Great feel and fit. Low quality. These shoes look 10 times better than the previous model. I am sure the new mesh will help prevent the toes rubbing through as it did in less than 30 days on th last shoes. I love how they fit and feel. My problem is with the quality. I have had these shoes for one week and the treads are peeling off on the edges. I don't run, I walk. I have not alked much in these. I am actually pretty sad they have not even lasted two weeks before starting to fall apart. This isn't my second pair of Brooks's shoes. I don't  know want to love them because they feel great. But I can't afford new shoes every month.",
110271,2,11/10/2017,"Ignore fashion, stick to what people want I know that fashion is moving towards simpler shoes (ie cheaper to make), but many people still need support/motion control shoes. There are so many shoes with low drop, knitted uppers, and very little by way of medial posting - the Adrenaline does not have to morph into another one of these. You have plenty of other shoes to choose from.I got an early release pair of these - disappointing. They need more posting, and some more overlays, further forward in the shoe, to lock the foot down onto the sole.It's a shame, as I can see that Brooks seem more interested in chasing the fashion market, than proper runners.Please make at least ONE shoe for moderate to severe over-pronators, in future. Not this one.",
110271,5,11/09/2017,"At last, Adrenaline is once again tops for wide feet I'm not a runner, but I walk a lot and wear sneakers almost all the time. I have wide feet, and as I get older and my feet continue to grow (recent news to me) I've found comfortable shoes harder and harder to come by. And it's been my experience that most shoes called 4E or extra-wide, aren't. Sometimes the problem is in the toe box width or shape, but mostly they're too tight at the mid-sole.The Adrenaline GTS is different, with an actual wide sole (as opposed to a standard sole with extra volume above) and a good fit from the mid-sole forward.I had great luck with the GTS 12, 13 and 14. However, with 15, 16 and 17, the overlays were wrong for my feet, causing severe pain at the knuckles in short order. I found a pair of new-old-stock 14s in my size last fall (2016) but they were worn by August of this year, and I've been just getting by since then.When the GTS 18 was previewed with engineered mesh and no overlays, I pre-ordered a pair, and it's the best Adrenaline yet. Compared to previous models, they're lighter and have more cushion in the heel, and yet they still have that great support and anti-pronation stance. These shoes were comfortable the moment I put them on, and still comfortable two weeks later.I wouldn't mind more color choice at the 4E width, but the grey/blue is fine, and frankly, I'm happy just to have shoes that fit comfortably. I couldn't be more pleased with the Adrenaline GTS 18.",
110271,4,11/09/2017,I would try this shoe The new design of the shoe is lighter and better ventilated. More comfortable than GTS 17 but hands down the GTS 16 was the best shoe ever. I will keep on running in the 18's but wish I could have my 16's back,
110271,5,11/08/2017,GREAT UPPER LIKE A SLIPPER Flexible but supportive upper.Bottom provides support but it cleverly allows normal foot motion by just having plastic on the medial side allowing good ankle movement.Upper much better without overlays,
110271,5,11/08/2017,"I love this update I use this to run in and it is incredible.  I have ran in the past few models and this one is the best.   The upper is amazing(got the NYC model, had last years NYC one also).  The midsole is more comfortable and I have a better toe off in this model.   I need to get a few more of these to wear all year round.",
110271,1,11/03/2017,Why did Brooks ruin their best midrange antipronation shoe? The Adrenaline is a Brooks legacy.  An excellent stable shoe for moderate overpronators now joins the legion of soft squishy unsupportive shoes.  Why ruin a legend?,
110271,3,11/02/2017,Great updates to a staple shoe ,
110271,5,10/28/2017,"Best Upper Ever on New Adrenaline This is the most comfortable upper on any Adrenaline (or any other stability shoe) that I have ever tried.   While some may not like the less structured mesh (with its lack of overlays), I think this is possibly the greatest update that Brooks has ever made to the Adrenaline.  If there is any change that i wish Brooks would consider for the Adrenaline, it would be a slightly lower drop.  That may be too much of a change for some loyalists, but an 8 to 10 mm drop would be better for me.",
110278,5,12/23/2017,"Love these.  Former PureFlow wearer. Used to swear by the pureflow until they changed the design, these are the best I've found since then.  Good bounce / support, lightweight, and they breathe well.  Very happy.",
110278,5,12/20/2017,"My new Go To Shoe Look- my handsome shoes get compliments. Feel- they feel snugger than the Transcends that I am used to. But that is a good thing. This thing hugs my foot like my mother instead of a brutish uncle. Just perfect.  Performance- comfortable ride, excellent support while still feeling light. Good response and bounce-ability. Overall- just a great high quality product. Yes it was expensive but I treated myself for the holidays and it was worth it...and I am worth it. LoL.",
110278,4,12/19/2017,Comfortable shoe ,
110278,5,12/18/2017,"Great Shoe for Neutral Runners I love this shoe. I had previously been running in a shoe that did not have a rubber outsole and I found myself slipping and I also found that the shoes wore out very quickly. However, with this shoe the outsole has shown no signs of wear and I have not been slipping at all. The DNA cushioning provides a very cushioned feel but keeps its structure. I have enjoyed my miles with these shoes so far and look forward to my runs in the future.",
110278,5,12/15/2017,"Happy since the first mile. These things are great and have told several people about them already. Right out the gate had a great long run and then the next day had a great speed workout. Like previous Launch's, it's light but comfortable. The new mesh on the toe box is really comfortable and the new collar is great as well. Looking forward to a second and third and probably fourth pairs. I marked it as a half size to big only because i did go down a half size only because the store didn't have my normal size (13) and they still fit fine. I'm sure if i went back up to a 13 it wouldn't be a huge deal.",
110278,5,12/02/2017,"Fantastic! Seasoned marathon runner, first experience with the Launch after many years in the Ghost, Glycerin and Ravenna. I've only had it a week but loving how light and responsive it is for runs between 3 and 10 miles. It makes me want to run quicker, as the shoe seems to respond well to additional pace. Well cushioned too despite the light weight! To be determined if it holds up to half marathon and longer distances but I feel like it will based on initial impressions. The style on these is excellent as well...Great job Brooks!",
120188,5,12/16/2017,"Always the best stability Good every day support for working out or going out on errands, walks etc. Best overall shoe for pronation.",
120188,3,11/25/2017,I would not buy this product again This shoe i love the color and comfortable but in a couple of months the stiching in the front coming apart and also on the side,
120188,4,11/24/2017,I would buy this product again Absolutely love the comfort of this shoe since recovering from plantar fasciitis. I've had at least 5 pairs so far and  I always get wear (holes) in the toe area within 6-9 months.  I sure do wish they could have a larger piece of reinforcement across the top at the tip to prevent this.,
120188,5,11/15/2017,I love this edition of the Addiction.  I love the colors too I use this shoe to run errands and around the house and yard.  My orthotic fits in it nicely.  I love the colors.,
120188,4,10/26/2017,"Great Fit, Great Comfort I have used several pair of the sister shoe (same shoe, different color) for about 5 years. like a number of other customers, I found it tends to wear out thru the toe prematurely. But it is so good for me in fit and comfort that I'm willing to live with that one negative.",
120188,5,10/26/2017,"Saved my feet! I am a nurse, I barely sit for 12+ hours, taking care of two floors- I am on my feet a lot. I was already planning on leaving a review so I got the #ReviewSweeps email and knew this was the perfect opportunity to leave my review. I've told so many people about these shoes since buying my first pair. These shoes literally saved my feet. I was having so much pain in my feet it was affecting my sleep, it hurt to walk, it hurt after days of rest. None of the dozens of brands I've tried have solved my foot pain. I was even considering going to a doctor! (If you know any nurses you know we are the worst patients, haha!) I did some research for running shoes(running is my first love and this pain had forced me to completely stop running) and came across this brand. I decided to try a pair (on sale!) and after ONE WEAR my foot pain was dramatically decreasing. After three wears I no longer had ANY PAIN! I worked seven days in a row wearing these shoes and had ZERO pain! They are the best, hands down. The support and comfort is unparalleled and they're so lightweight! I'm 100% satisfied and will definitely be a lifelong customer!",
120188,5,10/07/2017,"So why didn't I try these shoes earlier???? I walk 3-4 miles on a treadmill 3-4 times a week. I have had plantar fasciitis in the past and was beginning to feel the telltale signs of it coming back and my knees were really aching. Since wearing these sneakers (narrow width which are nearly impossible to find any more) aches have disappeared. And, they are wicked comfortable.",
120188,4,09/27/2017,Stitching came apart in toe of shoe. ,
120188,4,09/18/2017,"My go to running shoes I used to buy the Adrenaline and Ravenna, but since they got ""improved"", I stopped wearing them as they became so uncomfortable. I recently purchased a pair of Adrenaline 17 after reading the reviews, I tried them out and they're not bad, but the Addiction 12 are now my favorite running shoes. The Adrenaline 17 are the ""runner up"". I just wish the Addiction 12 would come in more color options.",
120188,5,09/18/2017,I will buy this product almost exclusively! My only complaint is that the laces are so long!   I'm trying inventive ways to tie them in order to get them short enough not to drag.,
120188,4,09/16/2017,"Yes, i would buy this product again. Left shoe collar began tearing within a few weeks and has gotten worse over the last few months. Right shoe have to keep retying a few times to get it to keep the heel from slipping.  Never had this problem with an Addiction after the first few days of tying.  This has been going on for a few months and I cannot get it right until I have retied it a few times. It is only on the right shoe.",
120188,4,09/15/2017,Shoes sturdy ,
120188,4,09/13/2017,Yes Podiatrist recommended for foot problem. Have helped greatly but do not like the loop to keep the tongue aligned. Shoe available in narrow on your site and having very narrow feet I tried them. Good fit.,
120188,5,09/06/2017,"I Plan to Buy This Shoe Again I need motion control support for pronation and this is the first time I have purchased the Addiction.  The insert is cushioned well and the toe box feels comfortable even though I have bunions.  I walk five or six days a week, and these shoes felt great the moment I put them on my fee.I purchase athletic shoes at least twice a year, and will buy Addiction again.",
120188,3,09/05/2017,"disappointed in fabric wear I have worn Brooks shoes for years and am disappointed in this last pair. The fabric inside the heel and along the laces has worn through, and the stitching and fabric over the toes has also worn through. This started to happen after wearing them only a couple months, and now after 6 months they can't be worn. The quality of the fabric seems to be inferior to previous versions of this shoe.",
120188,5,09/05/2017,"Great Shoe/Great Support I have flat feet, so really need the arch support. Brooks is the best shoe ever. Well made, and they don't wear out.I use them for everyday walking.I noted they feel 1/2 size to small because typically I wear a 10, and need a 10 1/2 in a Brooks.",
120188,4,08/31/2017,These work for me I've worn Brooks Ariel for many years but the newer models became too narrow and uncomfortable.  I purchased the  Brooks Addiction in wide width and they have the toe room that I need even wearing toe spacers.  (I've never worn a wide shoe previously.)  The Addiction has the support that I need for severe overpronation.  I did replace the insoles with a soft arch support insole.  The new tread pattern on the sole is a bit more prone to slipping than in older models.  It took me months of trying every brand of shoe to find these that fit well and had the support I need so I bought three pairs.  Very comfortable for walking and hiking.,
120188,5,08/31/2017,Love this shoe! ,
120188,5,08/30/2017,I would purchase these again I need good shoes to walk as I have very flat feet! I pronate but not badly. My feet are horrible and I get pain in them a lot. My Podiatrist says I have horrible feet so you see good shoes with stability and motion control are the up most importance for me!,
120188,5,08/26/2017,"Great shoe, although toe stitching breaks down quickly ",
120188,5,08/26/2017,"Love my new shoes! Wear them every day! I'm a teacher, and I'm on my feet all day long. They really help keep my feet feeling great at the end of the day. Plus the kids all think they are cool!",
120188,3,08/14/2017,"I'm so disappointed... As a long-time Brooks customer, when my Addiction 10s wore out, I bought a new pair of Addiction 12s.  As with all the other Brooks I have owned, I loved/love them.  They fit well and are extremely comfortable.  BUT, after two months of moderate wear, I can't believe they are already worn on the inside behind the heel.  Luckily it doesn't hurt my foot -- yet, but in looking at both pair of my old Addiction 10s, there's already more wear in the new ones than in either of the other pairs I've had for years!  Pretty unacceptable for a shoe of this price -- and from Brooks.  I may have to find another brand -- sadly...",
120188,3,08/10/2017,"Great fitting sneaker - but not so great insole This is my second pair of this sneaker. Fits really great. I did notice that this time it had a thin insole.  My last pair were thicker and were more comfortable walking and standing for extended periods.Any reason why they changed it??  I would have given it another star in the review, but I was very disappointed in this new insole.",
120188,5,08/06/2017,"I will purchase this product again! This is the best shoe for me. I only use this shoe for running,  but I'm thinking of purchasing a pair for just everyday use too.",

120188,5,07/11/2017,"I love these shoes: size 8EE These are the only shoes that don't aggravate my Morton's neuroma. The width is perfect for me. I can wear these shoes all day with no discomfort. Currently, I have 3 pair: One for trail walking that stay dusty; one for road walking and daily wear; and one spare.",
120188,4,07/10/2017,"Almost a perfect shoe for someone who overpronates Overall, a good shoe. I like the flexible sole, which I feel encourages a smooth heel-toe transition. Very supportive - I have super flat feet but don't feel like I need an insole. They're fairly nice-looking for a running shoe. These are both improvements over the older Addictions that I used to use. I use this shoe mostly for walking, but I don't think I would have trouble running in it.The only complaint I have is that the older Addictions had a really stiff heel to stabilize ankle movement. As an inveterate overpronater, I loved this feature. This new model has a more flexible heel than the Ghosts that my family wears. A little annoying, as this model is supposed to be for the people with the more messed up feet, right?? I've only been wearing these for a few weeks, but I've rolled my ankle a couple times already.  But in the end... these are Brooks! They're comfy. You can't go too wrong.",
120188,4,07/10/2017,"I would definitely buy this product again My only complaint are the shoelaces.  They are really stretchy and difficult to untie when I double knot it.  Otherwise, the shoes are great.  Also, I wish the models didn't keep changing every year.",
120188,5,07/06/2017,"When is the next version coming out? I love them. I love these shoes and they really work for me. That being said, I am having trouble finding them in my size and usually when that happens they are about to be phased out. Every shoe that I can wear( lots of surgeries  on my feet) goes out of production. So, will there be a next generation of the ""Addiction"". Please say yes. The other pluses other than stability, reasonable price and fit, ----they are dark in color and I do not have to always wear white shoes that get dirty all the time.",
120188,5,07/03/2017,Love love love my new shoes! Will be purchasing again! I wear my shoes to work everyday and they feel great. I'm on my feet all day and I have the worst feet every. Very flat feet and these shoes are the best ever! Highly recommend to anyone who has flat feet.,
120188,3,07/01/2017,Do not hold up well Very disappointed in these shoes-good support but I've only been wearing mine a few months and already have a hole in toe. Not worth the price.,
120188,4,06/30/2017,Great Support! Love the support of the Addiction and the Ariel.  Great shoes for those of us who are severe pronators!  My biggest complaint - why only the dark colors?  Many of your other shoes have fun prints and lighter colors.  Please add some lighter choices in these two models!!,
120188,5,06/25/2017,Perfect ,
120188,5,06/23/2017,It helps with your  posture. It's great. The only thing shoes were made differently. One had bigger sole the other was bigger  cloth. Looked different.,
120188,3,06/23/2017,"Too narrow Purchased this shoe a couple years ago without any issues.  Last one was too narrow, hurt my small toes.  Returned & purchased Ariel which fits perfectly but much more expensive.",
120188,5,06/17/2017,stability I ordered the wide and I wear them with spends total support max inserts. They feel stable and are holding up well.,
120188,5,06/11/2017,A classic Great shoes but terrible colors.  Please offer more feminine colors for women's shoes!,
120188,2,06/03/2017,disappointed have bought the addiction for years.  this is the first pair that fell apart within a month  .stitching unraveled and mesh developed holes  perhaps cost cutting measures have compromised quality . very disappointed  don't know if i will buy brooks again,
120188,5,05/25/2017,Support and Comfort! I am a long-time Brooks Addiction Walker wearer.  I simply love those shoes.  I have tried the Addiction Walker sneakers in the past but found that they did not fit me.  I decided to try them again and size up a half size and this time the sneakers fit perfectly.  I am so pleased with the support and comfort with these sneakers.  I get the same pronation control in the sneakers that I get with the shoes except that the material is so much lighter for the warmer weather.  I am also delighted about the color as I prefer a sneakers that aren't bright neon.  The sneakers looks stylish with everything I wear.  I can also wear these sneakers for a long day and my feet are comfortable and supported.  I purchased a second pair as a back up.  I highly recommend Brooks Addiction Walker line of shoes and hope that they continue to make them.  No other shoe manufacturer offers a shoe that is comparable to Brooks.,
120188,5,05/21/2017,"My Top Choice for comfort and Support! These are my go to shoes for daily walking -- outdoors and treadmill, and whenever I am on the go for most of the day.  Very supportive, no lower leg discomfort even after being on my feet all day.  I just wish you would make them in more attractive/trendy colors -- they can be a little boring to look at.  I have purchased 5 pairs of these shoes over the past 2 years.",
120188,4,05/12/2017,"These have done wonders for my plantar fasciitis Other than the laces, these are great. Laces are too long, stretch out and come untied",
120188,5,05/12/2017,Wonderful I've worn Action Walkers for years and decided to give these a try.  They are wonderful and very stylish.  Glad I bought 2 pairs.,
120188,4,05/07/2017,"been wearing this shoe for years,ready for a new color! ",
120188,5,04/24/2017,Excellent shoe yet again ,
120188,5,04/21/2017,"Great product The stability is the reason I continue to use them for all my walking.  Tried a different brand and came right back to these Brooks.  Although they are a little heavy, they offer the best all around support and comfort for an overweight woman continuing to work on weight loss by walking.",
120188,5,04/20/2017,"Would love more color choices Of all the shoes I have tried, this shoe is the most comfortable.  I do wish there were more color choices.  Other styles have so many options, but this one doesn't.",
120188,4,04/17/2017,Good shoe overall It is fine for me to wear a size 12 but I have to lace them up more than usual because they are a teensy bit too large.,
120188,5,04/17/2017,This shoe fixed my foot problems I power walk because I am too old to run.  My old shoes were making my toenails black and painful.  The Brooks shoes fixed the problem and I am walking comfortably again.,
120188,5,04/13/2017,Love them I've enjoyed jogging and walking in the Brooks Addiction for years in all weather.  Love the darker gray color! Very supportive and comfortable.  They seem to be off on sizes a bit.  I buy an 11.5 in these even though I'd normally wear a 10.5 or 11 in other shoes.  But I just know the 11.5 fits great and keep buying it!,
120188,5,04/13/2017,"I am in love with this shoe I use these as my walking shoes, daily shoes, have flat feet and overpronate.One use and all heel pain is gone, feet WANT to move, it is excellent in all ways. I mean I love this shoe. TRUE to size and my nine and a half narrows would know.So good and colors are my kind of colors....love the gray and turquoise...LOVE it.",
120188,4,04/11/2017,I would buy this product again Hi- I never knew your shoes come in width.  I went to a running store to buy shoes.  I bought one pair of shoes. When I got home I went online and saw that you have shoes with different widths.  As we get older our feet get some bumps here and there so a choice of widths is important.,
120188,5,04/11/2017,"I would buy these again in a heartbeat The Addiction 12 is an improvement, wider toe box, and comfortable. Contrary to people saying to order up, my advice would be to go get measured and then get a half size over your foot measurement as in any other shoe..this shoe is supposed to be snug to support the foot....I wear nine and a half narrow and the fit is excellent.It is true to size. I used to wear New Balance but they messed up their shoe with bad materials, etc. no support. Trust Brooks. I do.",
120188,5,04/07/2017,Immediate Comfort My doctor recommended trying Brooks sneakers and I'm so glad I did.  My husband and I walk several miles/week and I need a sturdy sneaker that offered comfort.  This pair of sneakers has worked great for me.  This is actually my second pair of Brooks sneakers I've purchased and I can't imagine buying another brand in the future.,
120188,4,04/04/2017,"Love the shoes, hate the colors/styles I have been wearing the Addictions for over 10 years and although I love the support, I just wish they would come out with more edgy colors like the Ghosts or Adrenalines.  Just because I need extra support doesn't mean I don't like cool colors!",
120188,5,04/03/2017,I would recommend these shoes. I wear these shoes all the time because they fit well with my orthotics.  My feet feel great!,
120188,5,03/28/2017,"Pleasantly surprised When you have been wearing Brooks Adrenaline's for years and out of the blue the running store asks ""when did we last look at your gait""...and sees that you aren't getting the support you need from your go to shoe :(  And they pull out the addictions and you cry a little bit inside...wrong direction...too heavy!  I'll never be fast!  But I gave the addictions a shot....and you know what?  They don't feel heavy-I did go up a 1/2 size bigger for extra room.  And I don't run any slower than I did in the GTS.  And my constant nagging knee pain is gone.  I've got about 100 miles on these and so far-they have done well.  I so wanted to be in the Ghost or Ravenna but it looks like I need the extra support so I can keep doing what I love :)",
120188,4,03/20/2017,I will buy this product again I use to walk 40-50 miles a week at moderate speed. Very comfortable but they wear out on the top mesh (holes) before I wear the soles bare. Still will continue to buy but wish the tops were more durable.,
120188,2,03/16/2017,Disappointed I've been wearing Brooks Ghost shoes for quite a while and love them. I read so many great reviews about the Addiction that I wanted to try them. I was very disappointed. My feet got tired and painful very quickly. They are not as cushioned and comfortable as the Ghost shoes. So I guess the Addiction works great for some but regretfully not for me.,
120188,5,03/13/2017,Great shoes! This is the fourth or fifth pair of these shoes I have purchased.  They help control my plantar fasciitis so I can continue to run.  My heels don't hurt anymore!,
120188,3,03/11/2017,Nice shoe not for me I have been a long time user of the Ariel and had changed shoes because of the color varieties. It does not give the support and cushion that I had in the Ariel.,
120188,2,03/09/2017,Addiction 12 wears out EARLY Hole in big toe at a month! 2 pairs did this! What? the Addiction has always been better than this! Where are they being made?,
120188,5,03/06/2017,"Love these shoes! I am not a runner, but I teach and coach track and field, so I do a lot of standing. These shoes are super comfortable and provide great support.",
120188,5,03/03/2017,Best shoe I've bought in a long time I'm constantly on my feet at work and these shoes have helped tremendously with foot pain.,
120188,3,03/03/2017,"Wish they had more sole cushioning. Already said, it doesn't have enough cushioning on sole and feels like a cheaper shoe.",
120188,4,03/03/2017,I like the fit but not the mesh..thin and cold ,
120188,1,02/21/2017,"Color? I waited for 1 year for a color and you pick darker gray, do you not read all these comments about color? I tired but have to return I can't past this color.",
120188,2,02/18/2017,"Quickly wearing out These shoes are great with my orthotics. The colors are muted which is a must for me. Sadly, the stitching is coming loose around the top on both shoes and the insides are getting holes all over with about 3 months of use. I wear these shoes mostly on the weekend just for knocking around. I haven't used these a lot or in my traditional way because I am recovering from leg surgery that caused me to need these shoes in the first place. If I am offered a warranty pair I will take them, but I am wary about purchasing again if this is the standard of quality.",
120188,1,01/25/2017,Addiction 12 is a far cry from Addiction 11 There were changes between the 11's and 12's 12's are more true to size. 11's ran half a size to big.11's lasted for a year12's last for about a month before the front and side mesh start ripping.Inside cloth less durable as well.I have 3 pairs of 12's that I alternate now since my 11's had worn out. All 3 pairs developed holes in the mesh and inside within a month.I would have given the 11's 5 stars whereas I would NOT recommend these. I give these a 1.,
120188,1,01/22/2017,"I loved the Addiction 11! I wear Brooks Addiction shoes every day. I started wearing them in 2014 when New Balance quality went downhill. I've owned 3 pairs of Brooks Addiction 11s and they were all fabulous. I've owned 2 pairs of Brooks Addiction 12s, one of each color, and after a very short time of wearing the shoes, a hole formed on the top of both right shoes in the area of the big toe. I am still wearing a pair of Addiction 11s and no hole! Although quite comfortable, the 12s were a total waste of money because of the holes!",
120188,5,11/11/2016,"More colors please! The addiction has been my go-to shoe for eight years or so. They give me everything I need in a shoe except for arch support (I use inserts) and color variety. As a woman in my mid-30s I have shoe envy every time I go to the gym! yes I am wearing the correct shoe for me but my friends and fellow gym-goers have awesome looking shoes, and well the addiction historically is not a good looking shoe (especially this last one - grey and a hint of pink ... the grey is overpowering and the shoe looks larger than it should). Please, please, please make fun-colored options for those that want a good fitting shoe that also looks great! I have other brooks in great colors but I can not work out in them (knees hurt, calves hurt, etc.) because I need the control the addition offers. Thank you!",
120188,2,11/08/2016,"Showing wear early Because of a nagging foot injury, my foot doctor literally prescribed these Brooks Addiction 12 shoes for me along with an orthotic.  They provide good support and are comfortable.  I was surprised to see, after about 8 weeks of wear, that the material around the top of the shoe was starting to deteriorate.  Yes, I have to wear these all day, including work, but I wouldn't expect this so soon. I'm not running in them, although I do hit the gym 5x a week.... Like the shoes, but wish they were a little more durable.",
120188,5,10/26/2016,"Hands down, best shoe for low/flat arches I bought these shoes after reading articles about the best shoes for low or flat arches. I was very impressed. I often get pain in my feet from running but I can run pain-free in my Addictions. I get tired long before my feet ever start to hurt. I love them; just wish there were more color options!",
120188,5,10/13/2016,"Addiction 12 shoe Did not like the 11, it was more pointed and uncomfortable to wear. The 10 and 12 both seem to be a little more squared off across the toe area and for me that makes them very comfortable to wear and do long walks in.",
120188,4,10/12/2016,"The Cushioning is Just Right Back in July I bought a pair of Adrenaline GTS 16s in a size 7.5, but sadly they didn't work for me due to lack of cushioning in the forefoot. (I am therefore very thankful for the generous return policy). Also, either Brooks shoes are getting smaller or my feet are getting bigger because I felt like I needed the shoes to be a little bit longer. I ended up going to a running store and ended up with Addiction 12s in a size 8.0. There is good cushioning throughout, they're longer without being too long, and the laces are nice and long (unlike the ones with my last few pairs of Brooks shoes). The only thing that could make these shoes better is pretty superficial: I wish they came in more colors.",
120188,4,10/11/2016,Excellent shoe I average 15-20 miles walking per week. I have severe pronation and feel these shoes offer great support.,
120188,5,10/10/2016,"Loving my new pair! I usually buy myself the Trenscends when I am training for a marathon, but the Addiction 12 has been a supremely excellent choice. I wanted to keep running but I'm not marathon training anymore - I wanted something with fewer bright colors but still gives me the support I need (I pronate severely!) and this was an awesome choice. They feel comfortable throughout the whole day and they are excellent when I am running, especially when coaching Cross Country at my school. They are good during drills and long runs! I'm so happy to have a great new pair of Brooks that help my runs stay supported and smooth! Thanks!",
120188,5,10/08/2016,Only shoes I can wear. I own 3 pairs. I'm an ER nurse and spend over 13 hours on my feet a day. This is the only shoe that I can wear without having sciatica and knee pain. All my fellow nurses wear this shoe also. Have purchased many brands/styles and this one beats them all! Only complaint I have is they only have two colors available!,
120188,5,10/08/2016,"Feels like nothing ""It feels like nothing!"" When I said that, the fitter said, ""Then it's perfect for you."" He was right. I have worn no shoes but these for over a year. This is my third pair. The arch is exactly what I need. The wide stabilizers help me not trip and fall. The only negative is that after three months my toes stick through the top and I have to get a new pair.",
120188,5,10/08/2016,Best Shoe ever! I have very wide flat feet and I got the Adrenaline 15 and the arch was too high for me. So I upgraded to the addiction and I love it. Perfect for flat wide feet.,
120188,5,10/06/2016,"LOVE these shoes !!! LOVE Brooks !  My husband runs & owns several pairs. So I bought a pair & fell in love. Quality, comfort & style !  So I bought a few more pairs... highly recommend. They are the coolest pair of sneakers !",
120188,5,10/04/2016,So far so good! I have plantar fasciitis in both feet.  I was told by my Physical Therapist to get these exact shoes for the structure.  So far so good.  Waiting to see the orthotist and see what inserts she recommends (I already have orthotic inserts i them).  Well made.  Shhh...  my husband even likes them.  Who knew we would take the same size.,
120188,4,09/30/2016,Approved by my PT Great shoe that I use for everyday. I had to add an orthotic to snug the heels. I also use it for short hikes in the woods (5-10 miles).,

120188,5,09/17/2016,Flat Feet Relief for this Runner I run 2 miles each time 3 days a week. It is helped me temendously with my after soreness pronation. I am not in pain with my flat feet. It is the supoort I need after jarring my ankles and knees for 25-30 minutes. Best decision I have made!,
120188,5,09/12/2016,"Brooks: best shoes ever I have been wearing Brooks shoes for over 20 years because they are comfortable and fit my feet.  I walk every day, averaging 45 minutes, mostly on asphalt, up & down inclines. I can wear these shoes all day and my feet never complain.",
120188,5,09/09/2016,"Reduces pain from foot injury I twisted my ankle and strained a couple muscles in my foot this past summer. I do a lot of walking at work and for recreation, and no matter how much I would rest and ice it at home, my injured foot felt very sore by the end of the day. While my injuries healed, I struggled to find a reliable shoe offered in various widths (I'm usually a 7W) that could support, cushion, and control my foot from turning. My daughter found this shoe online and we decided to try it out. She ordered me the 7.5W and it fits perfectly. I've never owned a Brooks pair of shoes before, so I was very pleasantly surprised that these kept the pain I felt by the day's end at bay. I've since taken them on a few off-island trips, and they're holding up very well with all the walking I do.",
120188,5,08/12/2016,"Used Addiction series for over a decade I use Brooks Addiction shoes for running only. I have been using this series of shoes since I discovered I had neuropathy at age 15 or 16. They provide the arch support I need and reduce the impact that was causing too many stress fractures before I used them. When I wear one pair out, I just order another. I highly recommend these shoes for road running to anyone with low arch problems and/or unusual gait.",

However, the Ariel colors are limited so I did the quiz and read the reviews and Addiction 12 was the winner.  But they do not energize my legs and feet like the Ariel's and the soles of my feet burn in these shoes.  So I'm returning them and re-ordering the Ariel's in the same color I have now.  The Addiction is a good quality shoe but not for me.",

These latest Addiction 12s (that replaced my last Addiction editions) already have a hole in the mesh. That has never happened.   In fact, the only reason I have ever had to replace my Brooks shoes is because the sole wears down over time. What's odd is that none of my socks (also Brooks) have a hole in the toe - just the mesh on the shoe.   I am very disappointed and will be seeking a replacement.   Hope Brooks makes good.",

My #1 issue with shoes is I have wide, flat feet, so I get blisters on my arches regularly, until I met Addition 11. Please bring them back!

120205,2,12/16/2017,"Brand it great! This brand I personally love. Unfortunately, breaking these shoes in has been a some what uncomfortable process.I will pick a different style in the future.",
120205,5,12/15/2017,Love my Defyance! I'm a fairly neutral runner that needs a little more support than the ghost provides n the Defyance is the perfect fit for me. Comfortable from the get go!,
120205,1,12/03/2017,Toe box has changed - will not buy again The design of the toe box has changed and the shoes were uncomfortable after less than 2 miles. Returned. Very disappointed.,
120205,1,10/23/2017,"Made my feet hurt I have been loyal to the Defyance shoe for a long time.  The only running shoe that I have loved.  However, when I got the Defiance 9, my feet hurt so much.  Not only pain but numbness.  I dreaded putting them on.  I thought it was just me, but after reading the reviews, it seems like a common problem. I don't know what to do now because I will not order another pair of the Defiance 9 shoes.  I hope they resolve these issues and come out with a defiance 10 that were like the older ones (only with better colors)   :)",

120205,5,09/14/2017,Just bought my second pair of Defyance 9 shoes! ,
120205,2,06/17/2017,"Returned I usually buy the Ghost model, but decided to buy these. I am a 10.5 narrow which is usually a perfect fit in Brooks. The Defyance 9 seem to run half a size short. I returned.",
120205,5,05/22/2017,"Loyal Defyance runner I felt I had to defend this shoe. I've been running in the Defyance for probably 10 years now (as a former Division I runner and now recreationally). I wear a size 9 in street shoes, and typically size up to a 9.5 in running shoes to accommodate my inserts and just because I like a roomy toe box for running. My first pair of Defyance 9's I purchased my typical 9.5, then I sized up to a size 10 on my next pair because they do seem to run a bit smaller than previous Defyances. Not a deal breaker at all, and that is the only issue I've had with these shoes. I encourage you try them out for yourself and don't just listen to the negative reviews. Everyone's feet are different.",
120205,5,04/18/2017,"Defyance 9 is my first pair! I feel the need to defend this shoe!  As it is my first pair of Brooks shoes, I can't compare these to previous models, but I have been very happy!  I do have narrow feet, so maybe some of the complaints wouldn't impact me.  I didn't know I needed a dyad--didn't even know what that meant--but have loved feeling that my feet and ankles are well-supported for running or walking.  My only complaint is that I am wearing holes in the toes very quickly--much more quickly than in cheaper shoes.",
120205,1,03/26/2017,"It is the end of the road for me and the Defyance I Have been wearing Brooks Defyance since the Defyance 3.  The Defyance 5 was my all time favorite.  I bought 7 pairs of the 5 and am now unfortunately on my last pair.  Defyance 5 had perfect cushioning, yet enough support with just the right amount of flexibility to protect the balls of my feet while allowing for  a smooth stride. I sorely miss the gel and find the new foam to be too firm.  I tried the 6 and kept it.  Tried the 7 which was unattractive and increased supination, so I returned it.  I kept the 8s out of desperation, although I found them to be not as supportive or protective of the forefoot.  The 9s  were so bad they caused ball of foot pain after wearing around my house for 35 minutes.  Unfortunately, I am now looking to other shoe brands for a more cushioned, supportive shoe with a roomy toe box.  I have found all Brooks shoes including the Dyad to have become firmer, offer less forefoot protection and smaller all around.",
120205,1,01/03/2017,"Not even close to the 8s I found that cushioned shoes became too cushioned and aggravated both my metatarsal joints and PF. A store gave me the Defyance 8 which was the answer to all my prayers. My running was great, and my feet did not hurt, straight out of the box. They were perfection, but as shoes do, they wear out. I could not find another 8 and my local stores stopped carrying the 9s because of negative reviews. I gave them a chance. I should have listened. After a 6.5 mile run, the balls of my feet are screaming and every toe felt like it was on fire or numb. I liked this line because there was a little cushion but not too much; these felt like they had zero.The Ghosts were too soft, the Glycerines were way too soft. Now I have to revert to my worn out 8s.",
120205,1,12/01/2016,Very bad shoe I run 3 times a week! Always had Brooks shoes nut this is the worst product ever made by Brooks! The nose of the shoe bows and that causes blisters on the top of your feet.,
120205,5,11/01/2016,"Love Defyance, Hate the 9! LOVE the Defyance line. They are my favorite as I have many pairs over the years. I thought it was just me when I got the 9's that they changed and I continued to use my older 8's. I've now seen that many people feel this way too. I hate the new version as they are not the same as before. The older versions were much better with more spring. These are harder to run in for me.",
120205,4,10/19/2016,"I would buy this product again Specifically bought the product for running, and maybe to wear casually 1-2x/week.  I only run 6-10 miles/week and unfortunately I'm getting shin splints, however this could be d/t my weak ankles, poor arches, flat feet etc.  The product is super comfortable to wear and affordable.",
120205,1,08/31/2016,"Way too tight at toe box What were you thinking with the redesign of this shoe, Brooks? I have bought this model for years and years---every time I need a new running shoe, I just buy the new version of the Defyance and it always works great. Went running with my new pair this morning and the toe box was painfully small and narrow. I felt like I was wearing dress shoes/high heels with the way my toes were scrunched. Held the shoe up against my last pair and sure enough, this model is noticeably smaller and narrower at the toe. Who are you designing shoes for with this pointy-toed disaster? I am extremely, extremely disappointed.",
120205,5,08/29/2016,I keep buying this shoe each year ,
120205,1,08/22/2016,"What has happened to Brooks!?! What has happened to Brooks!?!  My two or three all time favorite, can depend on, go to shoes were made by Brooks for years.  For some reason they decided to make sweeping changes to them and I agree with the other reviews - the new ones just do not make the grade.  They say they fixed the sizing issues in the Adrenaline 15 - it is still too narrow in the ball of the foot and the new application of the trim around the toe box means it now breaks on your big and pinkie toes.  And now the Defyance is completely different.  I'm hoping they change the trim on the adrenaline back to where it previously was and not even sure what they can do to get the Defyance back in shape!  It's a shame.  Used to be a go to company.  Now, not so much.",
120205,1,08/10/2016,"Unhappy with changes from previous models I have had many previous models of the Defyance, and all of them I have been very happy with. I wear orthotics, so I need a stiff neutral sneaker to maintain my alignment while running, and this has been the ONLY shoe that has given me proper support. Unfortunately the Defyance 9 update has been a huge disappointment. It feels clunkier and less cushioned than the 8, and feels wider in the ball of the foot. I'm so disappointed in this model that I started another epic search for another appropriate sneaker, and will likely have to switch brands. The Defyance 8 was really onto something great, the Defyance 9 has been a step in the wrong direction. Hopefully the 10 will be something more similar to the 8",
120205,2,07/16/2016,"Not as good as previous versions I switched from the Adrenaline to the Defyance several years ago, I think with the Defyance 3 or 4. 5 and 6 were great, I did not have a pair of the 7. The 8 took some getting used--much longer and narrower than the 6, had to go down a size--but in the end I loved them. The Defyance 9 is a different story. I've been wearing them for about 6 months now and I still don't like them. I can't pin point what is wrong with them. They seem like they are a lot of shoe. They don't feel as neutral or as natural as the 8. There's like extra room in the toe but the toe is too pointy. And this might be stupid, but the laces are super long and they shredded. The colors of the 8 were awesome, but I'm almost embarrassed to wear the 9. Overall they seem like a very old fashioned running shoe in both look and feel. I have to get a new pair and I don't really want to buy another pair of the Defyance 9, but I also don't want to have to go on an epic trial and error search for a new shoe. Please go back to something like the 8 when you design the 10.",
120205,1,05/21/2016,"Fabric ripped in less than 300 miles. I have ran in the Defiance's from version 3. I have LOVED them. Unfortunately with the revamp of the 9's they feel very narrow, and have I worn through holes in the fabric with less than 300 miles on them. I have never had holes in my shoes even with 450-500 miles on them. This new version is not the same shoe, and leaves me really questioning what to go with next, as I have worn Defiance's for the last 6 years.",
120205,5,05/12/2016,Love this shoe. This is my 4th pair. I use this product to wear everyday and I have a new pair that I only use for working out. I wear a 10.5 and this is the only shoe that I have ever found that fit my feet and keep them happy.,
120205,1,04/30/2016,"Too Tight Couldn't even purchase due to the tightness of the shoe.  Was told by my local running store that it was a shame, because the older generations are perfect for me.",
120205,2,04/08/2016,"Size changed from Defyance 8! I had the Defyance 8 in size 8.5 and when the Defyance 9 arrived in the same size they are HUGE! It's always a bummer when sizing changes on these shoes.  Still love Brooks, but had to go on the shoe hunt after this again.",
120205,1,04/05/2016,"Painful I have been wearing the Defyance for several years, unfortunately I could not transition to the Defyance 9. Something has changed with the top of the shoe, creating painful pressure points on the top of both feet. I was able to find a pair of Defyance 8 online in my usual size and purchase them, took them out for a 5 mile run without issue. I then tried the ghost and dyad but wasn't crazy about them. After chatting with a Brooks rep on this website they had no further suggestions. This has been my go-to shoe for years so what a disappointment! The only conclusion the Brooks rep could come up with was trying a specialty running shoe store and when I suggested trying another brand shoe, ""sounds good"" was the reply I got. Very disappointing.",
120205,2,04/04/2016,"Needs changes Disappointing... i have been happy with Defyance for many years and 9 is a different shoe.  I noticed much wearing of top mesh since 7, overall issues with 8, yet 9 is painful.  It's a peculiar feeling where the toe of the shoe feels too narrow, yet little support at sides - mesh and shoe laces have too much give, causing much irritation.  Also base feels stiff with less cushioning. i experience numbness in toes, pain along the top of foot and heel.  I truly hope they can bring back previous design of the shoe.",
120205,1,04/02/2016,"I need to find a new running shoe I loved prior models of Defyance, but the fit and comfort of Defyance 9 has completely changed and not for the better.  It's shorter, narrower and less cushiony than prior versions.  Didn't even try running in them; knew from trying them on they were no longer an option.  Why do manufacturers always change models and ruin a good thing?  Now I need to find a new pair of running shoes.",
120205,1,04/01/2016,"Super Sad about New Shoe I have been wearing the defyance for years!  At one point, the running store were I bought my shoes stopped selling defyance, so they put me in a ghost.  That did NOT work for me, so I went back to the defyance (but the store had to special order the shoe for me).  Now I am EXTREMELY disappointed that the defyance does not work for me anymore.  With the new design of the shoe, I feel the heel is higher than the 8, the shoe is more stiff, the arch feels harder/higher, and the toe box is smaller.  In fact, I even tried to go up a half shoe size, and that still did not help. I'm getting pains in my knees and feet. Now that I cannot run in the defyance shoe, I'm not sure what shoe I will run in.  #sadface",
120205,1,03/28/2016,"Defyance 9 not as good as Defyance 8 The Defyance 8 was the most comfortable shoe I had ever had. The 9 fit differently in the toe box.  I returned the shoe. Was very disappointed in the fit of the 9.  Not sure what changes were made, but please go back to what you had!!",
120205,1,01/26/2016,"Total disappointment I ran my first marathon in the Defyance 3, and I've been wearing Defyance ever since. The Defyance 8 was a step down, but was at least acceptable. The 9 is completely different and painful to run in.I first ordered my usual size, but returned the shoes because my toes were poking into the end when I was just standing in them. I ordered a half size up and tried them on two 5-mile runs. It felt like I was running in clogs: no cushion and the soles were stiff as boards. And even though I was in a larger-than-usual size, my toes were somehow being squeezed painfully. I also had knee and tendon pain I hadn't felt in years.Total bummer. Now I have to search for my perfect shoe all over again.",

120217,5,12/19/2017,LOVE! I searched for about 5 months for another pair of Brooks Glycerin 14 because I hated the 15s. Wish Brooks would make the 16 like the 14 when they do another shoe release!,

120217,5,12/16/2017,"So helpful for my shin splints! This shoe was recommended to me by a Brooks customer support specialist after I reached out to complain about shin splints. Due to an exceptional Black Friday sale, I was able to purchase these shoes much sooner than I anticipated! And they have been wonderful. I've been able to run consecutive days again, which hasn't happened in three months... The cushion and support I need (for the way I run) can't be matched.",
120217,4,12/16/2017,"very comfortable, great color options, would recommend This is my first time trying brooks shoes.  I love their colors and have heard good things about them.  I've been true to asics gel kayanos for years now.  And while I still love those shoes, they are pricey and you can't seem to find discount on them.  So far, I'm loving the glycerins and might even be a convert.  Need a few more months of running and training to be convinced.  I would recommend trying them out to anyone on the fence.  They don't have the same bounce/air feel as the gel kayanos but still very comfy and good support.",

120217,5,12/16/2017,LOVE THESE! I have had some Achilles problems and have been running in Saucony's. My friend who is a Chiropractor sent me a pair of these and my calves felt less pain when I ran in them. I needed another pair to that I could rotate every other day.

I tried Brooks after reading some blogs and researching the 'try and return policy'.  I like the cushion the Glycerin had over the Ghost so I went with it.  It took about a week of running to break in my shoes and I loved them so much I bought (2) additional pairs for the closet.  (I don't like the thought of change once I find a great product!) I am training for my first marathon and I will be wearing Brooks Glycerin 14's.  I have a few months before the race and wanted to make sure I had two pairs broken in for the big event.Note - I took a friends advice and ordered 1/2 size larger (size 7.5)  than my normal street size of 7 since I run in Florida heat and expect my feet to swell after hours of running.  I have normal feet for a 5'4"" woman @ 112 lbs.  Some other brands were running so small I felt missized!   Not Brooks Glycerin 14's.  The are PERFECT for me!",

120217,5,09/18/2017,I would buy this product again and again I love how comfortable they are and the support they have. The cushion is amazing.,
120217,5,09/17/2017,I love these glycerin 14's! This is my second pair!! Perfect comfort! Not a heavy shoe for the cushion! Love the smooth feel of them on a run! Only down fall is more variety of colors would be great!,
120217,5,09/16/2017,I would buy these shoes again and again ,
120217,5,09/15/2017,Great Sneakers! I actually bought these shoes as a gift for someone and they absolutely love them!,
120217,5,09/14/2017,"I love these shoes. I have been wearing orthodics.  The clerk at at Scheels in St. Clout, MN, told me that I was wearing the wrong shoe.  She advised this shoe and now I am wearing the shoes WITHOUT the orthopedics.  They fit like a glove and are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.  I'm 70 and wear  a pair everery day.  PLEASE consider making them in more subtle colors without the metalics for those of us who don't use them for running.  I love the colored soles instead of white, please make more.  Hope you continue this model in your inventory forever.",
120217,5,09/12/2017,Definitely recommend This was my first pair of Brooks and will not be my last. Most comfortable running shoe I have ever owned,
120217,5,09/11/2017,Love my Glycerins I bought my first pair of Glycerins. I liked them so much that I bought the same exact pair again.,
120217,5,09/11/2017,Awesome shoe ,
120217,5,09/09/2017,"Love these shoes! A friend introduced me to Brooks shoes 10 years ago. I haven't bought a different brand since. I run on the road and a treadmill if the weather won't let me outside. These shoes are comfortable from day one and never need to be broken in. I do have to order a full size larger than my regular shoes as they tend to run small.  I love the fun, bright colors that are offered.",
120217,5,09/09/2017,Love Glycerins Been using glycerins a long time! Tried the Ultas one spring and a pair of launches fir a couple races. Went back glycerins.,
120217,5,09/09/2017,"Still comfortable Surrounds feet comfortably. Recommend insoles. Laces are good short length. Good cushioning.  Sometimes, you forget you have them on.",
120217,5,09/09/2017,"The perfect shoe for those who supinate! It is rare to find a comfortable and supportive shoe for supination! Brooks has nailed it perfectly with the Glycerin!! From the very first run this shoe is comfortable and correctly fitting encouraging the correct stride. If you hit with the outside of your foot, you will LOVE this shoe and the support it has.  I often joke that I should own stock in Brooks  having a houseful of runners because this company does that great of a job  producing quality shoes time after time. We have a neutral, a severe overpronator and myself with the need for the Glycerin. Buy the shoe you need for your stride and Run Happy!!",
120217,1,09/09/2017,"Terrible experience I bought the shoes based on great reviews from my husband. Unfortunately it almost damaged my foot and I had to walk 5 miles back to minimize the damage.i was lucky that I had enough time to recover before my Marathon. Sadly i lost a few weeks of training while I was recovering..,",
120217,4,09/08/2017,"Love the quality and comfort If you order wide ones go half a size down, other than that it is worth your money.",
120217,5,09/08/2017,"i would buy it again these shoes ar every comfortable, i do feel like they're a little heavy though. wish they were lighter",
120217,5,09/07/2017,"I will buy these again I have always worn the Transcendence shoe and actually found the Glycerin on sale at another store so decided to give them a ""try"".  Well, not sure why I waited so long!  These shoes are so much more comfortable to me than transcendence.  I was a little hesitant at first because they fit a little tighter than what I am used to....but after one run they loosed up and fit perfectly.  They are light, full of cushion and perfect on the support.  I deal with heal spurs and cramping in my calf muscles often.  I have run in these several times so far and have zero problems from either.  In fact while I'm wearing them my feet and calves feel better than in anything else I am wearing....Just goes to show you you need to try each pair and find the one that works for you. Brooks....please do not change anything about these shoes!",
120217,5,09/07/2017,Best running shoe ever I have wide and flat feet and these shoes fit perfectly. The toe box is a little wider which makes my feet happy. The construction and material hold up after logging in lots of miles. I've tried many different brands of shoes and I'll never buy anything else.,
120217,5,09/07/2017,Perfect Shoe ,
120217,4,09/06/2017,Not the Glycerin they used to be. My first pair were the 7's. The arche support was fabulous! It seems to have been on the decrease since. The toe box also doesn't seem to be as supportive as its predecessors. I may try another Brooks in the near future.,
120217,1,09/06/2017,Glycerin 14 These are definitely NOT an upgrade to the 13's.  Ordered two pair and sent them back for something else.  Disappointed,
120217,4,09/06/2017,"Great for neutral runners This is super comfortable and great for a neutral runner.  This is my first Brooks ever after running in Asics Gel Nimbus for years!!!  A few things to note: - the heal does not come up as far on the this shoe as I am used to, it is still comfortable but takes time to adjust.-the shoe is about 1/2 size shorter than a normal 8 -there is a lot of room in the toe box-the cushioning is fabulous-the lacing is amazing and does not come lose when running 5 miles-bold colors are great",
120217,3,09/06/2017,Eh.. ,
120217,5,09/06/2017,Have 3 pair ,
120217,5,09/05/2017,Bought another pair because I liked them so much Like the shoes so much that I purchased another pair. Plan to run NYC marathon in the shoes,
120217,5,09/05/2017,"Love them! I run on pavement a large amount of the time and these shoes are perfect. They provide lots of comfort, and the cushion is notable in the way my knees have been feeling since I have got them! Love them!",
120217,2,09/05/2017,did not like toe area I did not actually wear these due to as soon as I saw them I knew I would not like.  I did however try them on just to make sure.  The toes go to a pointy end and are curled up like an elf's shoe.  Most shoes have the very end toe area go to a pointy finish.  I prefer a more rounded toe to avoid my big toe being pushed inward.  I don't even recall if shoe fit well or was comfortable or not. But the review made you select an option.,
120217,3,09/05/2017,Horrible colors Hire a a new designer to pick colors. I can't wear these atrocious colors to work or anywhere. Choose 1 or 2 color schemes like Nike.,
120217,5,09/03/2017,Best running shoe for me. This is my 3rd pair of exact shoe ,
120217,5,09/03/2017,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these shoes! Finally got these shoes in Narrow and it has made a huge difference!  Loved them before but REALLY love them now!  Most comfortable show out there!",
120217,5,09/02/2017,This is my second pair. Best cushion ,
120217,5,09/01/2017,"Happy I changed brands! The last time I tried a different brand shoe for running, I was miserable for weeks healing. For many years I've used N*k*. I'm so happy with Brooks running shoe! Soft, nice wide toe box, grippy, and cool!",
120217,5,08/30/2017,"Extremely light, comfortable and supporting. ",
120217,5,08/29/2017,I would buy these again These are my second pair and I am very happy with them. They hold up well and work well for anyone who has arthritis. They have great support too.,
120217,5,08/29/2017,"New lifetime customer! Light weight, great fit and lots of cushion. First time trying Brooks and won`t buy another brand after using these. Also love the color.",
120217,5,08/28/2017,"This is a wonderful running shoe This are beautiful, well made, light and comfortable running shoes, even though my running days are over, I still walk many a mile and also use the exercise bike at the gym. Highly recommended!",
120217,5,08/28/2017,I would buy this product again. I walk 4 - 5 miles daily.  These took awhile to adjust to as the Glycerin 12 is still my favorite. Brooks are the only shoes I've worn for walking  for the past 3 years.,
120217,5,08/28/2017,I would buy this product again. I walk 4 - 5 miles  daily.  There are worn almost exclusively for walking. I still like the old Glycerin 12 the best but Brooks was the best thing I've ever done for my feet. Been wearing them for the past 3 years.,
120217,5,08/28/2017,Excellent Shoe! I am a high school cross country and track runner and I run about 30 miles per week mainly on roads with some trail running sprinkled in. I have been buying these shoes since the Glycerin 11 and have always loved them and never had an injury *knock-on-wood*. When I tried on the Glycerin 15 in stores it felt slightly more narrow and less cushion-y than previous models so I stuck with the 14 for the second year in a row. I would highly recommend them!,
120217,5,08/28/2017,"adore these shoes. i'm not a high mileage runner bc running is not my primary sport. i use it to augment my main pursuit. however, i am training for a half marathon trail run and an earlier version of these shoes got me through it beautifully two years ago. i love that you buy these and put them on and never worry about blisters or a bad fit. they are perfect for my feet and make me feel like i'm running on pillows.",
120217,5,08/28/2017,"Ugly as sin yet more comfortable than any Glycerin to date I am a grandmother training for her first marathon a la Jeff Galloway run/walk and I love Brooks Glycerin running shoes. The only iteration that didn't win me over was the Glycerin 13. The G 14 is mighty fine, a true fit and a pleasure to run in but the silver, pink and charcoal is really not pretty. Since I am not a fashionista and my running clothes never match, the color of the shoes does not matter. I never look down anyway! They only had the azalea combo in 7 2A (narrow) size so there they are (two pairs!) in my closet. I can't wait to try the G15 to see if they are as great as the G14.",
120217,5,08/28/2017,Perfection. My third pair and will never try another. ,
120217,4,08/28/2017,Love Glycerin! ,
120217,3,08/28/2017,"Had to return it I normally wear a size 9.5 Narrow in other brands.  I followed the online recommendations for size (took the cool quiz) and ordered a half-size up.  This pair wasn't too long, but the half-size difference increased the volume of the shoe.  My foot was sliding laterally.   A year ago, I'd given Brooks a try (normally wear Saucony), and the 9.5 was too short.   I'm not giving up on Brooks because I liked the quality of the shoes, but I don't understand why this brand has sizing that is so unpredictable.  I also wish they would create some nicer walking shoes, since that is what I really need.",
120217,5,08/27/2017,"No break on run needed! The shoes are a little more narrow than my previous Brooks but it works out to my benefit. They are comfortable for long runs and springy for short runs. My new favorite Brooks!!! My first run in them was a 10 miler, no blisters or rubbing.",
120217,5,08/27/2017,LOVE THEM! ,
120217,5,08/27/2017,I own 2 pairs of these shoes! I've ran half marathons in these shoes and have experienced zero blisters or pain in my arches. I also own a pair to wear to work because I'm an occupational therapist and on my feet all day and I haven't found shoes more supportive and comfortable than these!,
120217,5,08/27/2017,Love this shoe! This has been my go to shoe for years and this edition continues the tradition!  The shoe is wide in the toe box which is what I need and provides great cushion. A wonderful shoe!,
120217,5,08/26/2017,"Love this shoe Great show, I do get bruising on my 4th to on one foot, but this is a minimal issue. I love glycerin, this is my 7th pair and 3rd of the 14s, love the 14s.",
120217,4,08/23/2017,"Amazing comfort, crummy appearance I have had these shoes less than a year and hands down, they are the most comfortable shoes I have purchased (as they should be for the price). I continue to wear them even though the plastic is cracking significantly and peeling off the shoes. A pair of shoes that cost what these do should hold up long than these have (I don't wear them daily). All in all, the shoes are so comfortable but the majority of the ""decoration"" has cracked or peeled off the shoes.",
120217,5,08/22/2017,"Great shoe! Great customer service! This was my second pair of Brooks glycerine shoes. I wear them for my job as an X-ray tech and I'm on my feet a lot and they're very comfortable. The first day I wore this pair, sections of tread peeled off one of the shoes. I called customer service and I the sent me a new pair overnight. the new pair is fine and I couldn't be more pleased with the customer service!",
120217,5,08/21/2017,Better than the 15 ,
120217,4,08/21/2017,Great shoe for comfort and lower mileage runners! ,
120217,5,08/21/2017,"The best! These are my favorite running shoes, my only running shoes! I own 3 pair of the exact same ones. I have tried so many different brands and styles and Brooks are the best!",
120217,5,08/21/2017,I will buy this shoe again ! This is my 2nd pair. I walk 2-4 miles daily for exercise . The most supportive and comfortable shoe I've ever worn !!,
120217,5,08/21/2017,"First time a charm I've had Brooks running shoes before but this is the first time that I tried these.  They are so comfortable and when I'm walking/running with them on, it feels like I'm walking on air.  Definitely will buy these again.",
120217,5,08/21/2017,"Great support for anyone who is on their feet all day These are my works shoes for my 12 hour hospital shift. This is my third pair and my feet never hurt, even after being on them for 12 hours straight. I have had back issues for several years and these shoes were recommended. These along with my orthodics have helped tremendously.   Never going to anything else for work shoes",
120217,4,08/20/2017,Comfortable and pretty My feet don't kill me at the end of the day finally (I am a nurse assistant and photographer and Mom) and that is great but I do feel like I still need more arch support then again I have pretty high arches so not the shoes fault.,
120217,5,08/20/2017,"These shoes top the charts! I love everything about these shoes: they are very cushioned without sacrificing spring in my push-off and the flex fabric upper provides a custom ""foot hug"" I didn't even know I needed. The last pair of runners earning rank as my all-time favorites have been pushed off the podium by these. Thank you, Brooks, for a great shoe!",
120217,5,08/20/2017,I'm glad I bought Brook's Glycerin 14 again! ,
120217,5,08/19/2017,perfect fit for my size 5.5 foot! ,
120217,5,08/18/2017,Love them! They are so comfortable! I don't run because of a previous left knee meniscus surgery but I walk a lot. I love the rubber shoes I just bought coz they are lightweight and the cushioning is perfect for my knees. So comfortable!,
120217,5,08/18/2017,Best shoes on the market ,
120217,3,08/17/2017,Not as cushioned as the Ariel I purchased this pair because I saw it was supposed to be the most cushioned shoe that Brooks offers. I wore the Ariel previously. I walk 5 days a week and am quite heavy so I want the most cushion I can get. The Ariel is definitely a lot more cushioned than this shoe. The shoe itself if comfortable and contoured nicely to the foot.,
120217,5,08/16/2017,I wear and will always buy Brooks Glycerin shoes I have been wearing Glycerin (walking shoes ) for the best comfort. My right ankle has been fused and these she's have the best cushion. I wear these all the time. I have one pair that I wear a special orthotic with and some I wear just a little heel lift. I hope u continue with the Glycerin.,
120217,5,08/14/2017,"Love love love this shoe! I use these shoes for both running and walking.  Over the last several years, I've tried the Ravenna, Adrenaline, and Ghost running shoes.  The Glycerin works best for me.  I have low races so it provides the best arch support and structure for my feet. The most important reason I chose this shoe is the fact that I experience fewer aches at the end of my workout.  My shoe size is 10.5 but I purchase an 11 for a bit of extra room for socks.",
120217,5,08/10/2017,Love my Glycerin 14 shoes I run 20-30 miles a week and the Brooks Glycerin are a great comfortable shoe,
120217,5,08/09/2017,I LOVE my shoes.  They are awesome ,
120217,5,08/08/2017,Best running shoe out there! I have been running 6 days a week for 25 years.  I switched to Brooks shoes 5+ years ago.  I am continuously in training for half and full marathons.  Right now I own 3 pairs of Glycerin 14's.  2 to run in and 1 to use as my everyday shoe.  Hands down....best shoe ever.,
120217,5,08/07/2017,I would but this product again and again These are my favorite shoes. They provide the maximum support for people with plantar fasciitis and they are very light,
120217,1,08/07/2017,"I always buy only Brooks The big toe area of the left  shoe gets very uncomfortable after wearing the shoe for an hour or so and walking. I have always bought Brooks, and never had this problem before. I am thinking it is a defective shoe. What do I need to do to return them for another pair?",
120217,5,08/07/2017,"My go to shoe, never disappoints. Love my new Glycerin's, they are super cushy and feel so smooth on the run. Great grip and control.",
120217,5,08/06/2017,"Addicted to Glycerine! I was having a terrible issue with plantar fascitis. I am on my feet every day for 12 hour shifts as a RN. I was having trouble walking due to foot pain. After some encouragement from a co-worker I went into running store to have my gait evaluated. They fit me for the neutral ghost 5 or 6(I can't recall). With proper shoes but I found that my foot pain began to resolve within the first 2 weeks. My issue was that the ghost didn't seem very durable to my amount of wear. 3-4 months later I upgraded to the glycerine 11 and have never looked back. I have had the 11's, 12's, 13's and 14's. I buy approximately 2 per year. They hold up well to my long days! Love the colors available and have referred multiple co-workers to buy Brooks. I won't purchase another shoe brand... EVER!",
120217,5,08/06/2017,Stable Friend This is an amazing shoe! I've owned the Glycerin 11's and the Ravenna 7's. I hated my Ravenna's and loved my Glycerin's so I decided to go back to them. I'm so glad I did! The 14's have the comfort of the 11's with some added stability that I love!!,
120217,4,08/05/2017,"The color is Fabulous! So, I have been wearing Brooks Glycerin for running for a long time. New kicks time, YAY!!! Love the excuse to buy new shoes. Went to local running store, wasn't not impressed with the new model. Came home ordered last year's online. Color is fabulous! Not that my feet care. Put them on and off we went. And then - discomfort. Weird right? Since when does a Glycerin hurt? So, tried again the next day.  I had run in the mud and rain I knew they were mine forever. Ended up buying some inserts that helped. Not sure what I will buy next.",
120217,4,08/05/2017,"OK substitute for the beloved defyance I bought these shoes to train for/run a half marathon.  I LOVED my previous Brooks defyance shoes (I had version 5) as they were the only shoes I ever found that fit well and did not cause shin splints (I have run since high school, competitively in college, and now well into my 30s and suffered shin splints all along EXCEPT with the defyance!)  I wanted another pair of those but based on the terrible reviews I opted not to get the new model of the defyance.  I got fitted at my local running store and these were recommended.  Much more cushy than the defyance but I found them very comfortable.  I like a wide toe box and these fit the bill.  I am between sizes and so sized up and they were perfectly roomy like I like.  They felt a bit stiff at first but broke in during training.  Sadly I did get shin splints while training in these, but not severe.  They were comfortable for the half, however I did get wear/a huge blister on the medial aspect of my big toe after the race and now that area still rubs every time I wear these shoes!  Overall, though this is a pricey shoe, I'd say it's quite comfortable and an adequate replacement for my beloved defyance shoes. Definitely a good buy when on sale!",
120217,5,08/05/2017,Own them! Bought my first pair in store. Loved them so much a year later I bought the same ones different color. I usually only get 3-4 months out of a pair. These lasted one year. Great shoe.,
120217,5,08/04/2017,"I would buy these shoes again Love the colors of these shoes. My feet never get sore, like with other shoes no matter how many miles I walk.",
120217,5,08/04/2017,Perfect Selection I love my sneakers!! Perfect for my running style. They are my favorite running sneakers.... the first time I had Brooks select for Me! I am very pleased!,
120217,5,08/04/2017,This is the shoe for me! Training for a marathon needing a few different shoes. Using glycerine 14 and 15 for miles and ghost for speed intetvals. Brooks are the only shoes that provide sufficient area for the forefoot! Hooked!!!,
120217,5,08/04/2017,Will buy this shoe again I work 12 hour shifts and on my feet. Thought I would try these and I am so impressed. Love them. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn!!! I highly recommend and will buy them again.,
120217,5,08/04/2017,"I love the Glycerin 14 This was my first Brooks running shoe. I went in to a running store to have a proper size fitting and to try on the Glycerin 15. Decided to go with the Glycerin 14, as it was on sale on the actual website. Love, love, love the shoe! Very comfortable on my feet. Feels like I'm running on cushiony pillows now. I look forward to running for fitness every chance I get, and working on increasing my run time.",
120217,5,08/03/2017,Always a winner ,
120217,5,08/03/2017,Love the Glycerins! ,
120217,5,08/02/2017,Love Glycerin I love the Glycerin line. Each year they increase in comfort and are a fantastic fit.,
120217,4,08/01/2017,I am very happy with my Glycerin 14's! While I can no longer run-I walk about 20 miles a week exclusively in my Brooks.,
120217,4,08/01/2017,"Happy and Comfortable My first Brooks Glycerin was a size 7, regular fit. With those shoes I lot a few toenails as the fit was quite fitted (not tight). I don't like sneakers with a lot of room, on my runs, but this shoe seems to fit perfectly. It is not too lose on my feet, yet very comfortable.",
120217,4,08/01/2017,"Presently Suprised I have wide feet ant the toe bed is VERY wide.  Love them on the trail as long as it's not a long downs slope.  I little sloppy in the front.  Love the extra cushion when running rocky terrain.  Wasn't sure of the huge sole, but he hey serve a purpose and I will be sure to get again.  Love that the grass seeds don't get caught as easily in the weave. I tend to make my own trail :)",
120217,4,07/31/2017,Great shoes I have been wearing these for treadmill running and generally working out. Pretty comfortable except they come up too high at the front of my ankle- sometimes bothers me,
120217,5,07/31/2017,"Consistently good in every way I use the Glycerin to help with bone spurs.  I believe that by wearing this shoe, along with other exercises, my bone spurs have pretty much gone away.  This shoe has been consistent in its quality and comfort.",
120217,5,07/31/2017,Love them! I usually buy a new pair of Brooks every 4-6 months and these by far are my favorite. I did have to send them back and get half size bigger but super comfortable.,
120217,5,07/29/2017,"I would buy this again and recommend to others! Previously hooked on the Ghost shoes but thought I would try these at the sale price and I'm glad I did, great, cushiony shoe!",
120217,5,07/29/2017,"These are my go to shoes!! Love them! I love to hit the gym and am on my feet all day long at work, I also have bad knees and these shoes help me do all the things that I need and want to do!! Super comfortable and supportive!",
120217,5,07/29/2017,Love my glycerin 14😍 I have been purchasing this brand and product for over 3 years they are worth every penny! Will not buy anything else.,
120217,5,07/29/2017,Love love love my Glycerin 14... ,
120217,5,07/28/2017,Excellent running shoes I discovered the glycerin over 6 years ago and purchase a pair every 6 months for running.  The glycerin 14 is my bes purchase yet!  The shoes are so cushiony soft and easy to slip on.  They provide excellent support.,
120217,4,07/28/2017,Good for now ,
120217,5,07/27/2017,"Exceptional Shoes I have worn Brooks for years. I have broken bones in my feet three different times, and suffered from reoccurring plantar fasciitis. There is absolutely nothing like the comfort and fit of Brooks Glycerin, if you are a neutral runner or walker. I don't run anymore with foot problems. I do walk a lot. I read reviews on the 14 and waited until Brooks website ran them on sale.  They are just great shoes. They do run a tad smaller than the 12 and 13's. Which is great for me as I run between a 7 and 7.5.   I just love these shoes.  Great color selection too.",
120217,5,07/27/2017,Awesome Love these shoes. Ran in them for the first time tonight. Shock absorbers. So comfortable.,

120217,1,07/24/2017,Wear and tear Only had these for 2 months and the mesh had a little hole which now is Hugh,
120217,5,07/24/2017,Just perfect from first fit! They feel just perfect but shoe laces could be a little longer. I like to double tie and they are short,
120217,5,07/23/2017,Love them!!!  waiting for next year's sale.... i am a massage therapist and on my feet all day.  At the end of the day my feet still feel great.,
120217,3,07/23/2017,Hurt my feet This shoe didn't seem to have enough padding in the mid and forefoot.  It caused mid foot pain when running.,
120217,5,07/23/2017,"I love these shoes! I've owned prob a dozen pairs of Brooks, & after 5 marathons & countless miles of training have never had a blister or problem with my shoes.  Best shoes out there!",

120217,5,07/21/2017,Great toe box!!! I have worn Glycerin for 7 years. Only shoes I run in. Never lost a toenail or had a blister. Cut my ankles once because of SOCKS. It was pouring and they slipped down in my shoe. Not heavy. perfect support and cushion.,
120217,5,07/20/2017,"I love Glycerin! My 3rd pair These are great shoes, I accidentally ordered a half size smaller than I should have. They're expensive, but worth the price as they last a long time...and I'm very hard on shoes. I was fortunate enough to catch a sale and get them for around $100. Great deal!",
120217,3,07/20/2017,"They hurt ! And rub blisters ! They rub blisters on the sides of my heels ! I would love to be able to wear them , but every time I do I get new blisters !!",
120217,5,07/18/2017,"Avid Glycerin Wearer! I've been running in Brooks Glycerin shoes for almost 10 years and honestly cannot find a better shoe for my high arches. I've tried other ""cushioned"" running shoes (Asics Cumulus and Brooks Transcend) but they just don't seem to fit my feet right - the Asics model was a bit more firm during running which gave me a slightly sore back/hips/knees, and the Transcend's were a bit too wide for my foot and started to give me blisters on 10+ mile runs. I'll usually buy a couple of pairs of Glycerin's when they go on sale since they're on the pricier side, but I have to say that each new model that Brooks releases seems to be better than the last. Plus, I've been wearing these for triathlons and Tough Mudder's and I never experience any discomfort or blisters during the run, despite the fact that they're usually drenched from the water. I'm training for my first Ironman triathlon this fall and will happily be sporting these across the finish line.",
120217,5,07/15/2017,LOVE the Glycerin! I've tried on all the Brooks running and walking shoes.... the Glycerin is the perfect one for my foot.  Everything about it is comfortable and it feels great the second I put it on.,

120217,5,07/13/2017,"Great shoe I have foot problems due to bunions and also have lower back pain due to arthritis and stenosis.  My favorite exercise is walking.  I need a shoe with a wide toe box and good cushioning.  I had great difficulty finding shoes until I found Brooks Glycerin years ago, and since then I've made sure I always have a couple of pairs.  Plus, they come in wonderful stylish colors and are light weight.  I just met another walker who was wearing the same Brooks Glycerin; she also said she loves these shoes.  I've recommended them to others, including those without any foot problems, and those who bought them like them.",
120217,5,07/12/2017,I would recommend this product A little wide in the toe but great cushion. Wish they made a shoe that fit tight to the foot like the pure flow with the same support as the shoe,

120217,5,06/29/2017,I buy glycerin This is the shoe I run in 30-35 miles per week.  I buy them at end of season on sale when available.   I wear 2 pairs at a time and switch between them.   I can wait the extra 6 months for the upgrade to save 20% when there is a sale.It is a great shoe.,

120217,3,06/26/2017,"Great color, No cush Overall good shoes and attractive.  However, since you ask, actually I am disappointed with this pair.  They feel old/used, i.e., no cushion under my feet.  Do they deteriorate just by sitting around the factory?  They feel just like my old ones that I've been wearing for a year.  I'm going to have to buy replacment insoles so that it doesn't feel like my feet are directly contacting the pavement ow.",

To try and save money but stay in a cushion shoe, I bought a pair of Neuro earlier this year. Clearly you get what you pay for as I had leg and back pain. I switched back to Glycerin and I feel like I'm running on a cloud. So if you want a cushion shoe, spring for the Glycerin and stay away from Neuro.",
120217,5,06/11/2017,Very comfortable! I wear these shoes to work and when I go for a walk or run. They are super comfy and have lots of cushion without being heavy.,
120217,5,06/09/2017,"Great shoe for my foot problems! I have alway worn Dyads, which I liked, but after talking to one of your representatives, she suggested that the Glycerin 14 might give more cushioning for my feet problems (heel spurs and plantar fasciitis.)",

120217,4,05/31/2017,"Love this shoe I absolutely love this shoe. Fits my foot perfectly and I love the amount of cushioning. I have run 3 1/2 marathons in them and have had no problems. My only con for this shoe is that it breaks down sooner than I hoped for the price of the shoe. I was hoping to get between 400-500 miles out of these shoes before having to get a new pair and I only got about 300 before noticing aching legs and hip issues. But since I love the feel so much, I'm willing to pay the price for the shoe and buying a new pair sooner!!!",
120217,4,05/31/2017,Have a lot of these Luv these shoes Have some I use for running and others I use for work. Only draw back is the inner cushioning material around foot will degrade and tear apart. Other than that--my fav shoe of all time.  Never worry about foot soreness on long runs. Uber cushy ride. On feet all day teaching college classes--glad they work on regular footwear as well.  Kudos to Brooks,
120217,4,05/26/2017,"changed the sizing for Glycerin I found that Glycerin 11 and 12 fit my feet well as I needed a large toe box to accommodate my toes which tend to spread and curl up. Therefore, I had purchased several pairs of them in the past. I finally need a new pair but find that Brooks has changed the Glycerin 14. I need  to order a whole size larger.  The shoelaces were also too small although Brooks was kind enough to send another pair.  I am a walker and also work out in the gym.",
120217,4,05/26/2017,The Glycerin 14 shoes The only reason I did not give the Glycerin 5 stars is because the thread always comes unsewn on the toes of every Glycerin tennis shoe I have,
120217,5,05/25/2017,"Nice shoes with lots of cushioning I really like these shoes except that the colors are completely different than shown on my monitor. They are much more washed out than the vibrant tones pictured. (I got the light teal/purple ones, the purple was more of an orchid, not what I hoped for). Probably going to return for a different color as I bought for a team sport with those colors.",
120217,3,05/24/2017,"A little underwhelmed These are...fine. Not nearly as cushy as previous versions, in my opinion. Still comfortable, still fit great, just not as cushy and I can start to feel it at the end of long runs.",
120217,5,05/23/2017,7th time buying the Glycerin! Brooks doesn't mess with a good thing. The past three versions of this shoe have all head up to par. I run 4-5 times a week 25- 35 miles and the shoe lasts 3 months.,

120217,5,05/20/2017,"Brooks are ALL I wear in a tennis shoe! They are the best! As a registered nurse I am on my feet and on the go 12-14 hours a day, Brooks are my go to shoe for any work, play, travel, etc. This is my third pair and I will never wear another athletic shoe again. My daughter is an avid athlete and she turned me on to Brooks...best advice she could have given me! Love them!",

120217,5,05/16/2017,"Comfortable! These have become my go-to running sneakers! The cushioning has made all the difference for me. They are light and comfortable. I ordered size 8.5 as that's what my other Brooks sneakers are, but they were too big and I returned them for a size 8 which fit great.",
120217,5,05/11/2017,"My Go-To Running Shoe I have worn Glycerin's for 3 years now, these shoes are my running partner. Consistently comfortable and reliable. I wear them for marathon training and long running, good for 500 miles per pair.",

I sprained my ankle a year ago and Ive struggled with finding a shoe that cushions as well as supports my ankle. LOVE. THESE. SHOES! They are extremely comfortable. They come up slightly higher than the other pair of BROOKS shoes I returned in exchange for these. Great for keeping my feet steady.,
120217,5,05/08/2017,"Love this shoe! Got these shoes and wore them for over 20,000 steps per day this past weekend at a dog competition event. Very comfortable right out the box, I was on my feet a lot and running quite a bit. Plenty of room in the toes and felt good with my plantar fasciitis.",
120217,2,05/08/2017,"Didn't Make Boston Cut I qualified for Boston twice at two different marathons in the Glycerin 13. I bought a new pair post-marathon in December 2016. Went for two long training runs in 2017, preparing for Boston, and found that this current model caused blisters on the inside of my feet where the big toe juts out and then inward. Not sure what happened in between models, but I couldn't take a chance of running the race of my life, my first Boston, in shoes that would cause blisters starting at approximately mile 13. I now own a pair of Sauconny Freedom ISOs. I'm sorry Brooks. It certainly wasn't the socks, because I experimented with those. What exactly did you change between models? I'm up for suggestions for a different pair of Brooks. On the other hand I switched to Sauconny about three weeks before Boston, and they performed beautifully. You'll have to entice me back to Brooks.",
120217,5,05/04/2017,"i would buy again I love the glycerin 14's they are the reason I purchased BROOKS.  I have always purchased Asics Gel Kayano's in the past, and these shoes were much more comfortable than other BROOKS models I tried on.  So far I'm loving the shoe",
120217,5,05/01/2017,"Great Fit ! I like the Glycerin sneaker-- my Favorite was the 11.  the 12 was too tight in the toe box, the 13 was good and the 14 is good but my favorite was the 11. It had the most amazing fit ever.  Granted I went to Marathon Sports that is local to where I live to have them fit me for the best sneaker and it was there I was first introduced to the glyceirn 11.thank you",

120217,4,04/19/2017,"Great shoe! Overall, I loved this shoe! I went through a tough time with ordering because I ordered my original size and the shoe was causing my blisters. Once I went up a size this shoe was perfect. It is very comfortable and keeps me sturdy as I run. Unfortunately I am having to return the shoe. The arch of this shoe is very flexible and after meeting with my doctor the shoe is causing excess pain in the ball of my foot. Wanted to love it so much. She will be missed!",
120217,4,04/18/2017,"Feel incredible. The Adrenaline's have been my go to for years, but I tried the 16s and they felt poorly made and painfully stiff. Switched to the Glycerine's and I'm thrilled. This shoe feels well made with great cushioning but it doesn't feel too heavy. I run 5-6 miles per run and love this show. The toe box is a little tight so might order another half size up next time but I'll live with it.",

120217,5,04/16/2017,"Love this shoe! I have tried this shoe on in the past but did not like it as the toe box was far too big for my narrow feet, creating the clown shoe effect.  However, this iteration of the Glycerin gets it just right in terms of size and comfort.  This shoe is comfortable enough for long runs and lightweight enough to accommodate speed work as well.  I will definitely be purchasing another pair to add to the rotation!",
120217,3,04/16/2017,"Not enough room for orthos, VERY short laces! These don't fully support my orthos.  The addiction style that seems to be discontinued or in the process of it, ( which has dull colors)  is much better for me and my orthos.. Although in that case the laces are too LONG!  The Glycerin 14, they are ULTRA short.. and don't support my orthos as the heel space is not high enough.  Very cool colors.. good support for stability.  But I am disappointed.. Although I will keep them, but not for major ( I walk up to 25 miles or more a week)  walking, since they are very cute.  PLEASE give us back the addiction in these colors.. You would have a win win!  Thanks!",
120217,5,04/14/2017,"New Favorite I have worn Asics Nimbus for years but noticed that the last two pairs have not held up well; the material tears in the same area so we guess they are using cheaper material or production and we won't buy anymore. Brooks are a new brand for me but I am very pleased with the fit and wear so far. The sole grips well but doesn't interfere, is lightweight, looks good, and is very comfortable with no areas rubbing. I have never tried a wide in an athletic shoe before now but seems just a tiny bit wide for the normal width; there is plenty of room and I just tie the laces tighter and it seems to do the trick.",

120217,5,04/07/2017,"Awesome Shoe...Need Better Colors! I just switched to Brooks from Adidas, which I loved but was looking for something new.  The Glycerine is an awesome shoe, but why are the color options for the higher end shoes so bland?  Brooks makes such great shoes, now give them great designs too.  Offer some prints and funky stuff along with the traditional colors.  Bring some of the cool prints you are doing for the Launch and other lines to the Glycerine and the Ghost.",

120217,3,04/07/2017,"Okay. I am coming back from a knee injury and wanted to start off on the right foot :)  So what better way to do that, then with the Glycerin 14!  However, I have been averaging about 10m a week (50% less than miles than previous models of Glycerin's I've owned), and I am extremely disappointed by the durability of the shoe's tread.  On the medial region of the toe box the tread is becoming detached from the sole of the shoe.  At this price point I would reasonably expect this to be not something I would see at the distance I have put on these shoes for just six weeks.  In terms of arch support, responsiveness, and cushioning, this series of Glycerin's have not disappointed; however, if the shoe's tread falls off these things mean nothing.  Great shoes...have been for many years.  Just need to revisit tread adhesion and COLORS - would love to have more muted colors offered for women!  Green, Orange, Grey, Yellow...please limit the pinks & purples.",
120217,3,04/06/2017,"A bit disappointing I have been running in the Brooks Glycerin series for the last several years and every year they've gotten better and better. Until now.  I couldn't wait to buy my new shoes for an upcoming marathon, even going so far as to grab my size off the shelf without even trying them on. That's how perfect they've always been.  I got home only to find that the shoes feel distinctly more narrow through the mid foot (toe box is still good) and there is absolutely zero ventilation.  One mile into my training run and my feet felt like bricks on fire.  How sad! I have truly loved these shoes until now.  I will say on a positive note that I ran nearly 19 miles for a first run out of the box and had no other problems like leg or foot pain or blisters.  They're still a decent shoe and have the best cushioning out there which is why I will keep them. I was just disappointed in the narrowness and ventilation issues.  The 13 series was the best shoe I've ever had!",
120217,5,04/06/2017,Like walking on a cloud! ,
120217,4,04/06/2017,I love these shoes! This is my 3rd pair! ,
120217,2,04/05/2017,"Already getting blisters I bought these instead of another brand, I run around 8 miles 3-4 days a week and I am already getting blisters..... disappointed.",
120217,3,04/05/2017,"Wish the 12s were still being made I held out because I am a lover of the Glycerin 12. I searched high and low to find the remaining pairs of 12's and finally exhausted the supplies. I never wore the 13s so I can only say that the 14s are A LOT different than the 12s and not in a good way. They are stiff and less cushioned. My left foot doesn't mind but my right foot is rebelling against them. I never felt that there was a ""breaking in"" period for the 12s but I guess these will require that. I wish running companies would understand that avid runners LOVE to buy the same shoe when they find one that works..... so stop changing what works! I love Brooks as a whole so I will continue to buy their shoes..... just wish they would continue to produce lines of shoes without reinventing the wheel each time. If you have any 12s hanging around in 9.5; I would be happy to buy them. :)",
120217,1,04/04/2017,"No Ventilation These shows have no ventilation. My feet are wet within 2-3 miles, making long runs painful. I have had more blisters due to the friction with the increase moisture in the shoe compared to my old brand. My shoes are even still wet the next day after a 3+ mile run.",
120217,5,04/04/2017,Great fitting running shoe! ,
120217,1,04/04/2017,"Shoes Don't Breath I had a hard time spending this amount of money on the shoe, but they came highly recommend. These shoes don't breath at all. I have had more blisters due to the moisture in the last two weeks, then the last two years. My feet at wet within 2-3 miles making long runs very uncomfortable and painful. I am wearing the same socks as my previous shoes. I would not recommend these shoes.",
120217,5,03/30/2017,"GREAT shoe. I am very loyal to this brand. My only complaint is the miserable selection of colors available. I like to buy a different looking shoe every four months, and the last three I bought were the identical color because there was nothing available in my size and width. Increase production of wide width because inevitably those are sold out.",
120217,5,03/28/2017,I do buy this shoe over and over I had surgery on both my feet 5 years ago and after my surgeon recommended a place to fit me in the right shoes.  Brooks have been my shoes ever since!  My husband walks on average 7 miles a day at work and switched brands after hearing what a difference they made in my life.  We wear them EVERYDAY! Thank you Brooks for giving me a happier part of my life back.,
120217,5,03/27/2017,Excellent Sneakers I bought a pair of Nike's that were around $85 and thought these have to be the best but I wore them once and my big toe nuckle hurt really bad I just thought I needed to wear them in because they were new but nope over the course of 4 months my foot started to ache all the time even when I was not wearing them. Thats when I said to myself Enough is enough!  Time to buy something better. I Googled the best high arch running sneaker and Brooks Running Glycerin 14 came in 1st. So I bought them. The first time I wore them the pain decreased significantly I have had them for over a couple weeks and don't just use them for the gym but for normal wear and the foot pain has completely stopped!!! I wouldn't have thought that a pair of sneaks would help but I am sure these Sneaks are the best! Thanks so much Brooks Running for making great shoes!,
120217,5,03/27/2017,"These shoes are meant for me! These shoes are so comfortable.  Sometimes my feet feel a little heavy, but that's usually at the end of a 10+ mile run...so probably more fatigue than the shoes :)",
120217,3,03/26/2017,"Narrowed toe box I've been a faithful Brooks Glycerin shoe buyer for many years. I've always been able to jump right into my next pair & pick up right where I left off with little break-in period, until 2017. I always purchase the wide width and really have had great success being blister free. However, with this year's model the toe box feels much more narrow. I've been laid up with blisters- severe blisters- that happen after running 6 miles. Blood blisters too. I'm not quite sure what has happened with this shoe, but I'm going to have to move on sadly. The blisters totally derailed my training this winter. I spend too much $ on races to wear ill-fitting shoes. So sad :(",
120217,3,03/26/2017,"Too stiff and heavy for me These shoes seem very well made and durable. I did order 1/2 a size bigger than usual and they fit just fine. However, for long runs, they are too stiff and heavy. I need more cushion. I'm trying to find an alternative to Hoka's because I think they are causing some foot problems for me, but unfortunately I don't think the Glycerin's are the right choice for me.",
120217,5,03/26/2017,"This novice runner loves these shoes! I am new to running, and went from couch potato to running 5 or 6 times a week on a treadmill. These shoes are so comfortable, even this fat girl (soon to be thin girl) can get thru my runs...while every other muscle in my body aches, my feet do not. Love these shoes. Just make sure to buy a half a size up. They run slightly short, and you need that extra half size due to your feet swelling anyway (during workouts). Did a lot of research before buying (didn't want to waste money), and so glad I bought Brooks...and love the Glycerin 14's.",
120217,5,03/26/2017,Perfect Fit ,
120217,4,03/23/2017,Almost my favorite ,
120217,4,03/23/2017,"Great buy! I run any where from 3 to 5 days a week, with 6 miles be the furthest I've ran. Most miles on the road but do run trails occasionally. I feel they have great traction for both. They are lightweight and very comfortable. I did notice my Ghost 8's maybe had softer cushioning than these do, but still a comfortable shoe for the amount I run.",
120217,5,03/23/2017,"In love...again! These are my third pair of Glycerin and each new model is better than the last.  I use these shoes mainly for running short distances (5k's) and for long distances (13.1's) and am happy with the support.  I am flat-footed, so the arch support and comfort of this sneaker works great for me...not too much arch height, which is uncomfortable and tends to hurt.  Overall, the shoe is a bit bulky but has great cushion and stability.  Love the new colors, I have gotten many compliments on them.",
120217,5,03/22/2017,"Glycerin is ultra-comfort for your feet! I was looking for a good, cushioned, supportive sneaker for walking.  I had foot surgery 4 years ago and stability in all shoes is critical to me. I LOVE my new Brooks shoes...........so comfortable with good support - can't wait to see how they wear over time.",
120217,5,03/22/2017,My Favorite Running Shoe I'm about to purchase my 7th pair! This is the best running shoe for me! I retire each pair after so many miles of running and will then use them for walking or working out at the gym. Can't say enough good things about the Glycerin! I also just purchased my first pair of the Caldera for trail running,
120217,4,03/21/2017,I would buy again 1/2 size smaller Loved the shoe. Comfortable and supportive.  However feels like there is too much space in the toes.  Haven't taken them in the road yet to see how they wear.,
120217,5,03/19/2017,Perfect! Buying another pair! This is a great shoe! More coushin than the last version. Buy a half size bigger than your normal size. Buying another pair since I love them so much!,
120217,5,03/17/2017,"Best shoe ever for working 12 hour shifts at the hospital! Great for the working nurse,the best shoe I have ever found that cushions my feet! I have no fat pads on the bottom of my feet but these shoes take all my pain away!",
120217,5,03/16/2017,"Love my Glycerins I had a size 9 in the Glycerin 12s. The 14's definitely feel snugger but as comfortable for long walks. I walk about 20 miles a week. These shoes ensure way reduced aches and  pains in the feet, legs and back because they keep me well supported and aligned.My only complaint about the last pair is that the fabric on the toe box  around the big and small toe of the right shoe wore out and tore in a year.",
120217,5,03/15/2017,"I would buy this product over and over again. I just started running not too long ago and never had a good running shoe prior to these. Wow, what a difference a good pair of shoes can make. I am also a nurse and imagine these would be wonderful after I retire them as a running shoe.",
120217,5,03/13/2017,"Perfect! Perfect. Love that they come in narrow widths! I'm a neutral runner, run 35+ miles a week, train for anything from 5Ks to Full marathons and am so glad I found these shoes. No doubt that they will be perfect for daily training and even racing. All around comfortable shoe. Not too mushy yet not too stiff. Great support for a neutral runner! Pricey but worth every penny. Will continue to buy as long as they come in 2A!",
120217,5,03/13/2017,"Best for fussy feet This is the only thing I want to run in. Great for my problematic, wide feet.",
120217,4,03/09/2017,Glycerin 14 is great ,
120217,5,03/08/2017,"Very comfortable and ""cushiony"" These work great with my orthotics. Didn't require ""breaking in"" and have been wearing them for 10 hour work days.",
120217,5,03/05/2017,"The Glycerin Series Just Keeps Getting Better! In the beginning I had to start wearing these because of the position of my toes. Now I continue to use only this brand and series as I am able to run, jog, and trail hike without any discomfort. I have tried other styles and brands but the Brooks Glycerin series is consistent in meeting my needs to continue my activities.",
120217,5,03/05/2017,Just what I wanted I have a narrow foot and I sooo appreciate a good looking functional and comfortable shoe that fits my foot. Thank you Brooks! I can no longer run but walk (and do) forever!,
120217,5,03/05/2017,"Great support for long runs My first pair of Glycerine was G13 which I got 2 years ago when I started running again a year after my HNP surgery. I had plantar faciitis back then and the G13 helped me run comfortably. As a matter of fact, I ran my half marathon with them and they felt great! And it came the time to retire the pair. So I replaced them with G14, which I just bought yesterday. Today I took them for a light 10K run and they're just awesome! I love the fit, the cushioning, and the ground impact. The overall feeling was comfortable. The most important thing was, there are no blisters after the run and no pain.",
120217,4,03/04/2017,"Awesome support and perfect for being on your feet a lot These shoes are great for both being on my feet for long hours as a nurse and for medium-distance road running most days of the week.  They have great support and are very easy to break in.  They are not ideal for trail running or sharp cutting/movements but are better for long, steady periods.",
120217,5,03/04/2017,Love this shoe I have difficulty finding a running shoe that doesn't hurt my feet. (Morton's neuroma and bunion). This shoes really works for me.,
120217,5,03/03/2017,Super Comfy ,
120217,5,03/03/2017,i would buy agian ,
120217,5,02/28/2017,this one for me👍 ,
120217,5,02/27/2017,"Left Asics Nimbus 18 in the DUST! I am on my feet all day in an athletic facility, walk an average of 8 miles a day and also wear these to the gym. These shoes are amazing! My feet, legs, knees NEVER HURT at the end of the day. Indoors, outdoors, trails, treadmill-all good. The traction on wet surfaces could be better.   I was sold out for Asics Cumulus 18 until my pinkie toe went numb and never fully regained feeling. The Portland Running Store folks are amazing! I'm in my second pair of Glycerin 14's, replaced after the tread went bald after 991 miles logged. ( but even then my feet never hurt). Would like a neutral gray or black for work.",
120217,5,02/25/2017,"Like walking on a cloud I went to a running store and these are a perfect fit! Room in the toes and sturdy sole support! Also, cushion makes it feel like I'm walking on clouds!",
120217,2,02/23/2017,Very Different from 12's My 12's were so perfect. I am returning these 14's with a very deflated heart. I will have to go find a store & try shoes on.,
120217,5,02/22/2017,This is by far my most favorite shoe ever!  They are amazing Great support for any arch and are just all around a great shoe and worth every penny,
120217,4,02/12/2017,I love this shoe.. so comfortable . I have been running  for a couple of years off and on . Had a hard tim r finding a comfortable  shoes. This one is great.,
120217,5,02/10/2017,"Like walking on air. First off, I am not a runner.  I am a walker.  I was looking for a comfortable shoe for an upcoming vacation where we have lots of hikes scheduled.  I wanted a light weight shoe that had good arch support.  I have found that shoe!  This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought.  It does seems to maybe run a little small as I have always taken a size 7 1/2 wide, but went with the 8 wide instead.",
120217,2,02/10/2017,"Where's the padding? I recently bought a pair of this over the internet. Never again! There is a distinct lack of padding that i have some to expect from Brooks. This is my third pair, and they are not comfortable at all. I have a high arch, so I need the support. my last pair where like walking on clouds, but they developed holes in the bend (the Adrenaline 15's). Honestly, it feels cheap. Brooks seems to have lost their way and are using lower quality materials to maximize profit, but they are losing business by altering their formula.",
120217,5,01/22/2017,"The Best Running Shoe I've Ever Worn The Glycerin 14 is perfect for me. Don't ever change a thing. I jog on an outdoor asphalt trail. I tend to supinate, and this shoe corrects that pretty effectively without being uncomfortable. The toe box is roomy without giving the appearance of a clown shoe. The cushioning is perfect and so is the arch support. I can (and have) worn these shoes all day when I know I will be walking miles, and I have never had any issue with comfort or blisters. Out of the box the Glycerin 14 is outstanding and comfortable. And beautiful! I get complimented on a regular basis for these shoes (I have the purple).I started wearing Glycerins back when the 8 was the latest model. It wore out quickly, but everything else about it was perfect. I kept trying, but at some point I just gave up on this model. I couldn't justify spending the money for a shoe that was going to have virtually no outer sole left after a few months. And so began the trial and error of wearing other brands that were just as pricey and wore out just as quickly. I tried trail shoes. Even worse and stiff as a board to boot. Four months ago I started looking around for new shoes again and checked out the new Glycerin 14. The consensus seemed to be that this shoe's outer sole had been improved greatly, especially in the forefoot (where I was having the biggest issue). It sure looked better when I checked it out in person. I decided it was time to come back to Brooks. I am SO pleased. Four months of regular use on the same surface at the same speed with the same gait, and these shoes are going strong, and my feet and legs couldn't be happier! Thanks, Brooks. You won me back.",
120217,1,01/05/2017,Bring back the 13s! This is my 5th pair of Glycerins and I am so disappointed!  I've worn these on the treadmill about 5 times and every time I have to stop to readjust my lacing because either my toes go numb or they are rubbing in a weird place.  The front pad feels like there is no cushioning between the insert and the sole.  I don't know what Brooks did but these unfortunately are going back and I now need to find a new running shoe :(,
120217,2,12/04/2016,"Disappointing The Glycerin has been my go-to shoe - or had been.  These are definitely more cushioned and comfortable than the 13, more like the 12's were.  But the tread has changed and these DO NOT grip on wet pavement.  The toe slipped as soon as I pushed off and continued to do so throughout my run. Additionally I feel the arch support is not what it was.  I have high arches and when I first started with these a couple years ago they were perfect! Seeing as I live in the PNW and run in wet conditions about 8 months of the year, I had to return.  So disappointing. Ended up with the Ghost, whose traction is far superior and seems like there was better arch support.",
120217,5,11/21/2016,The Ferrari of Running Shoes!!!!! These shoes are AMAZING!!!!!!! I have run in the 12s 13s and now the 14s. These are the most comfortable and cushioned!!! They do run a half size smaller than the previous versions. I live in the center of Venice and to say the ground is hard is an understatement and with these I don't feel the impact. I am a Brooks girl for life !!,
120217,5,11/12/2016,"Perfect for wide feet and narrow ankles I have very wide feet, narrow ankles and I wear orthopedic insoles. So yes, shopping for shoes is always an unpleasant experience that I postpone until all of my shoes are falling apart. If I order shoes in larger width (W or D), they are not too large near the ankle. If I order them in regular width (C), my toes are crammed. I also need to find neutral shoes to fit my insoles.These sneakers are amazing. They are super wide in the front so my toes have plenty of space and my super wide insoles fit perfectly (I struggled to fid shoes in which they would fit). The color is great (got so many compliments on them).They are really comfortable. I wore them for the first time for a 30-minute eleptical workout. The next day, I wore them to walk to school (45 minutes) and took them off 12 hours later. I didn't get any blisters (which almost never happens).My only criticism is that they lack a little aeration. Hence, I could feel my feet were getting quite sweaty over time. But otherwise, I found my new pair of sneakers for many years.",
120217,5,10/25/2016,"The most comfortable shoes; great style & worth the money These are my 3rd pair of Brooks! I love the fit, style, & color of these running shoes. I use them mostly for walking on concrete at work, on my elliptical machine, and for kick boxing/circuit training. They support my narrow feet well; I do not slip out of them as I do with many other shoes. Also, I love that my feet do not overheat during exercise due to the sturdy ventilation construction. I receive compliments regularly on the color and style since they are so unique. It goes to show that once again, you get what you pay for - and then some. :) I highly recommend these shoes if you have any problems finding comfortable shoes that fit well.",
120217,2,09/26/2016,Not in love I bought these for running. I've run in the Glycerine 12's & 13's and loved them! I just can't get used to these.,
120217,2,09/26/2016,Toe box is too small ,
120217,5,09/23/2016,"The Best THis is my second or third pair of this same shoe because they fit my narrow foot so well and they are very cushioned, which I like. I even ordered these without trying them because I knew the Glycerin pair I just wore out felt great. No complaints!",
120217,5,09/23/2016,"LOVING the new cushioning on the 14!!! This is my third pair of Glycerins and I am loving the 14s!!!  I was introduced to Brook's running shoes about 2 years ago, I used to be a loyal Nike Pegasus wearer. The Glycerin 12 was my first Brook's shoe and I have not looked back since.  I was a little disappointed whit the 13s, they didn't feel cushioned enough, I struggle one I first started running in them.  Then I heard about the cushioning improvement on the 14s......pure heaven for my.  I am a half marathon runner so I do pack on the miles every week, plus I am a custom orthotic wearer too.  The orthotics fit nicely into the sneaker.  Due to the new cushioning the sneaker feels a bit more snug, I usually wear a size 9 but needed to go up half a size to the 9.5.....fits perfectly.  My only negative about the shoe is this, it slips on wet road surfaces. As I push off, I have experienced my foot slipping out from underneath me a little.  Other than that, it is a great shoe.  Happy running!  :-)",
120217,5,09/20/2016,"LOVE this shoe! These are the best shoes I have ever run in. I am training for a marathon and I couldn't find the right shoe, until these! I'm thinking about buying another pair exactly the same so I have a back-up. I have problems with my left foot (bunion and two previously broken toes) and these are the only shoes that haven't hurt me. I would highly recommend!",
120217,5,09/19/2016,"LOVE these shoes! This is my third pair of Glycerin's. I was nervous to buy the 14's because I loved the 13's so much. However, I think the 14's are even better than the 13's.",
120217,4,09/18/2016,"Comfy and supportive Bought this to be 2nd pair of Glycerin 14 - just different color (to rotate shoes). I just ran my first half-marathon in my original purple-color Glycerin 14 which were about 80 miles in to use by race start. They are terrific! These shoes combined with the user's fairly careful focus on proper running form (lots of hlls/downhills and mix terrain - both dirt and paved roads), had zero knee/feet issues the whole way. Nice and easy to walk in too as needed (this 1st timer just had to!) on the paved sections after 11 miles worth and let me run well through the finish line itself.My feet - normal arch, some overpronation on right foot - gradually easing up, use no orthotics (recommended not to by deep tissues/chiropractor as had overused in past - and now successfully restored previously fallen arches, biomechanics through dedicated PT/deep massage work), and now always seeking a ""neutral"" but nice feeling and stable enough shoe and with still enough proprioceptive feel - especially for trails per below.This second pair felt a little unexpectedly stiff on 1st run out on them (for about 3 miles worth), didn't recall that with my first pair - that is why the 4-stars instead of 5, hopefully they'll break-in better in the future runs but still feel great otherwise. As a mountain trail runner (about 90% of running there), zero success in any brand of ""trail"" running shoes - too stiff, uncomfortable, causes tightness/numbing issues with plantar tendons, including Brooks' Cascadia unfortunately, I also use my Glycerin 14 for my technical hilly/rocky/cambered distance trail running. They will probably wear quicker that way but feel out of options there - still comfortable and supportive enough in those conditions and have none of the issues that crop up with all the trail-specific shoes. Thank you Brooks for these great shoes!",
120217,5,09/16/2016,"Thank you for including a color that's NOT pastel Been wearing these shoes for several years, and I keep coming back. This review is primarily to say THANK YOU for finally making a women's running shoe that's not pastel. It so hard to find a shoe thats not baby blue/pink/sea foam green as a woman. Refreshing to finally see just a normal red/blue combo.",
120217,5,09/15/2016,Love these running shoes ,
120217,2,09/14/2016,"hurt my feet and too long Lots of cushion but still hurt the outer side of my feet in the middle opposite my arch. Returned. Also, sizing off compared to other Brooks shoes.  These are longer than the Ghost and the Dayna.",
120217,5,09/12/2016,I only wear Brooks Glycerin I have bought Brooks Glycerin shoes for the last 4 pairs. I use these shoes to workout in the gym and run on the road. They are great for both. These shoes provide you with the cushion and support you need to go the extra mile. They are great for casual running!,
120217,4,09/11/2016,"Very different internal fit from the ghost I have been a devoted Ghost wearer for almost 5 years. This particular marathon season, I was looking for more cushion and perhaps longer wear out of each pair so tried the Glycerin. While comfortable for short runs (3-6) miles, I noticed some ankle soreness after. I attempted a 23 mile run this past weekend and that soreness turned to pain around mile 11 and I had to cut my run short at 18 miles. While I need the wide width for the toe box, it was overall much roomier than the Ghost and wasn't holding my foot in as well. They unfortunately will be going back. Great shoe, just not for me.",
120217,5,09/10/2016,good shoe ,
120217,5,09/10/2016,Brooks Glycerin Running Shoe Is A Keeper I use the Glycerin Shoes because it supports my high arch. I also use it with Orthotic  Inserts to give extra support. I found this  is the only shoe that my feet are not sore after a full day of work. Every time I purchase the next Series of Brooks Glycerin I am completely satisfied.,
120217,5,09/08/2016,Awesome shoe I don't have anything bad to say about these. Loved the 13s and love the 14s now!,
120217,5,09/08/2016,"Run Like the Wind I ordered these shoes after much research.  I was wearing Brooks Ghost 7 but they are no longer being produced, so I was forced to find a new shoe.  I wanted to stay with Brooks because they are the only brand that does not rub when heal when they are new.  I also need a shoe for my under pronation.  This shoes feels just like the Ghost 7.  Very comfortable, easy to run in, lightweight.  Since I run on the street, I go through shoes in a year.  We will see how long these last.",
120217,2,09/02/2016,Wish you were Ghost 7 I loved Ghost 7 wide in 6.5 but I can't wear any of your current or recently current shoes as my buying all of them and returning all of them tells you. How about making a shoe that fit my feet like the Ghost 7 did?,
120217,5,08/31/2016,"Best women's running shoes Best women's running shoes for under-pronaters.  Do not ever discontinue them.  This years are better than last year, feel similar to the 11-12 which were excellent.",

120217,5,08/28/2016,So comfortable I don't want to take them off! I was a little surprised with the silver bling on the emblem . But I now love them! Super comfortable and I love how the look and fit. I will never buy another brand. This is my 2nd pair of Brooks.,
120217,4,08/25/2016,"So comfy I am so far really liking this shoe. On my second week of wearing it, and so far, so good!",
120217,5,08/24/2016,Loving my glycerin 14!! I use them to train for marathon. I ran 8miles on first use and th y felt perfect. My feet didn't hurt and shin splints went away after a couple of runs. I love the colors I got the red and blue ones.,
120217,5,08/24/2016,"super comfortable I am a distance runner and upgraded from the Glycerin 13 to the Glycerin 14. Foot feels stable, shoe doesn't feel bulky and they are very comfortable. I ordered 9.5 wide and they fit true to size with enough room to comfortable accommodate an orthotic insert. Very pleased with purchase and will definitely recommend to others and purchase again.",
120217,5,08/23/2016,"Great work shoe! I use these shoes for work. I am on my feet for 12 hours and need something lightweight and comfortable. These are perfect! I do have a very high arch,however, and benefit from inserts.",
120217,5,08/23/2016,"This is my 5th pair of Glycerins I workout at the gym and walk everyday getting my 10,000 steps. These shoes are great. I have been wearing ,Glycerins for over 6 years. They are a great all around shoe.",
120217,5,08/21/2016,"Love these shoes! I run about 5 miles a day in these shoes- this is my fourth pair of glycerine's over the last 4 years and I LOVE them. I tried another shoe recently and had to go back to the glycerine asap... nothing compares.  The woman at my local running shoe store was right when she said these are the ""Cadillacs"" of running shoes",
120217,5,08/20/2016,"LOVE!! These Glycerin 14's are by FARRRRRR better than the 13's!! I have worn the Glycerin since the 9.  I am absolutely in love with my 14's!! I have put approximately 75 miles on them since I got them about a month and a half ago.  I am training for a half marathon and running 5 out of 7 days a week.  I have zero pain or any type of problems!  These shoes are AMAZING!! I will be purchasing another pair for sure!! If your on the fence, my advise is to fall off into the Glycerin 14's and enjoy the ride!!",
120217,5,08/19/2016,What plantars fasciitis ??? ,
120217,5,08/18/2016,love my glycerins I have been running in the Glycerin since the model 9's. Will continue to use them!,
120217,1,08/16/2016,Not right for me ,
120217,4,08/13/2016,"Loads of cushioning I am still in the testing phase of loving this shoe/.  I have worn Ghost 7's and wanted to try something else, and would have gone with the ghost 9's, but did not like the colors. I like cushioning for my neutral gait and thought to give these a go.  This shoe has awesome cushioning, as many reviewers noted.  I have an average arch and the first few times I wore these on my runs I noted some lowerback pains I had not had before. In subsequent runs this has not been a problem so it may be more of a breaking in issue, then fault with the shoe.",
120217,5,08/13/2016,Best running shoes I've ever owned! Most comfortable shoes I've purchased. I have a high arch and have tried every shoe out there. These fit me perfectly. They provide cushion and stability when running and I love the tread for wet weather outside and the treadmill inside. They are also very lightweight. You have a new fan!,
120217,5,08/12/2016,"Great shoe! I've never written a review - but had to on this one.  I wore Adrenalines for years & switched to Glycerin 2 years ago. I loved my 12's and was so disappointed with the 13's when they came out, but decided to give the 14's a try before starting the painstaking search of a new running shoe.  The 14's are amazing!  I've been running for 15+ years and these are my favorite shoes ever!!  I've got over 500 miles on these and they still feel and look great.  I always go up a full size in my running shoes due to orthotics (and they're usually just a bit too large) but these are perfect - so they must run just a little shorter than previous models, but it's a perfect fit for me.  Great cushioning in all the right places.  I plan to stock up because you never know what the next edition will bring -",
120217,4,08/12/2016,More color options in the Wide Width ,

120217,5,08/11/2016,Love my shoes!  I will be getting more in the future. ,
120217,4,08/09/2016,Love the shoe but already coming apart on bottom I have had these shoes for about a month or 2. I work in a clinic setting and these really help with my back pain.. I love the shoes but the bottom on the right shoe is starting to come off. I only wear these to work 3-4 days a week.. They wear great but disappointed they are already falling apart,
120217,5,08/08/2016,"This shoe is amazing! I usually don't give reviews on anything but in this instance I was so pleased with this purchase that I had to say something. So here goes..I needed a good running shoe as I wanted to start walking my neighborhood. Of the many running shoes in my closet not one was a great choice.  I told the salesman at the store I went to what my needs were (good arch support, lightweight, helps with my back pain) yada yada.. and he brings out this shoe.I was very skeptical at first for a few reasons. 1. I had never even heard of this brand..2. I wasn't a fan of the color and 3. the price. I tried it on and OMG..this shoe felt amazing!! I could literally walk in it  all day long. I won't be buying any other running shoes ..as a matter of fact..I came home and bagged up all of my other running shoes and plan to give all them away.",
120217,5,08/07/2016,"Love it!!!! Love it, so much cushion and flexibility! Great from the time I put them on until the moment I have to take them off. LOVE!",
120217,3,08/01/2016,Good but not great I do like the shoes and they look great but feel too heavy in comparison to glycerine 13. Also don't like the heavy padding around the ankle. Now I do know these shoes will last me a long time and this is the reason I am not returning them.,
120217,5,08/01/2016,"Love the shoe Love my shoes, I tried these on in the store before ordering, had to order 1/2 size up.  Would love more color choices.",
120217,5,07/30/2016,Love. I love these shoes! So comfortable and supportive. A bit more cushioning that I expected but it feels good and I like it!,
120217,5,07/29/2016,"LOVE! I love Brooks Glycerin 14!I have worn Brooks Glycerin for years, and Glycerin 12 was my favorite. I had seven pairs of them because I loved them so much! The 13s, though, were disappointing. The quality wasn't what I had come to expect.Happily, Glycerin 14 feels as good as or better than 12. Also, like the 12, Glycerin 14s seem to be very well made. I'm excited to have a great pair of Brooks Glycerins again! Yay, Brooks!",
120217,4,07/27/2016,"Love them for shorter distances Love my Glycerin 13s so when the Glycerin 14 came out in the cool purple/blue color, I thought I would replace my 13s.  Took them on a couple of runs.  They work great for 5k/10k distances, but was getting hot spots after mile 8.  I could run forever in my 13s without any hotspots.  So regretfully, I am returning.  I would recommend them for shorter distances.",
120217,5,07/27/2016,"The Cadillac of running shoes Full disclosure:  I am a walker, not a runner.  I'm a 63 y/0 overweight woman working on my fitness and I walk up and down hills everyday. These shoes are neutral and cushioned, just what I need as I have a high arch and a neutral gait. There is a reason that Brooks is referred to as the Cadillac of running shoes.  Brooks will accept returns for 90 days after purchase...that is 90 days of running or walking in these shoes;  Brooks wants us to be satisfied and I am and customer for life.",
120217,5,07/27/2016,"great shoe for comfort every day and also for hiking and run I have arthritis and when wearing this shoe I don't realize I have arthritis, am pain free.",
120217,5,07/25/2016,Love them This is my 6 th pair of Glcerin and Iove them.  They run short so had to order a size up ftom my normal size.  I hated the 13...felt like there was no cushion from the start!  The 14 seems to be back to normal and they feel great on long runs!,
120217,5,07/24/2016,"Better than I hoped! struggling with other shoes.  Usually wear Ghosts, but other decided to try a little more cushion.  12 mile run out of the box and forgot they were even new!  My feet didn't hurt nearly as bad.  I'm definitely impressed!",
120217,5,07/23/2016,"Excellent support/comfort walking and/or running! Shoes hug heel, and rest of feet in all the right places, immensely comfortable. Have two pair, rotate daily and enjoy the comfort of being able to be active daily.  Feet do not sweat, they are cool. I have arthritis however do not notice it at all when wearing these shoes! I wish you had shoes for wearing in a more formal setting, with the same support and comfort. Thank you for these shoes!",
120217,5,07/22/2016,Love them!!!! I've tried several different Brooks shoes now for running.  Liked the Glycerin 13 the best out of them all.  Got a pair of 14s and must say these are by far the best now.  I've got heal issues with long distances(6+ miles) and these cushion better than anything I've ever tried (ever!!).  Won't ever wear anything but Brooks!,
120217,5,07/19/2016,just the perfect fit ,
120217,4,07/17/2016,I would buy this product again The only problem with this shoe is that I feel tightness across the top of the shoe where the laces begin.  I have high arches & wide feet.  I got a wide shoe.,
120217,5,07/17/2016,SO MUCH BETTER than the 13's! ,
120217,5,07/14/2016,"I do like these sneakers ! I do like the glycerin 14's. much better than the 13's. but still not as much as the glycerin 11's.  I have a pair of 11's kicking around and they are still my favorite all time fit... the glycerin 14's are much closer to the 11 fit... toe box is better, not as large as the 13's (which was far too large) and not as tight as the glycerin 12's (?) which were too tight.so thank you for listening !",
120217,5,07/13/2016,I would definitely buy these again! I bought these trying to find something that wouldn't hurt my PF more...these are very comfortable.. I can wear them all the time with my PF pain improving.,
120217,5,07/10/2016,"Love these shoes! I walk daily.  My first Brook's shoes were the Glycerin 12.  Loved them instantly, right out of the box, no need to break in.  When the Glycerin 13's came out, there was as sizing problem.  Way too much room in the toe box, and I had to return them.  7 was too small, 7 1/2 was too big.  The Glycerin 14's have fixed that sizing problem, I am happy to say!!  Best shoes I've ever had for comfort, right out of the box.",
120217,5,07/10/2016,"Awesome shoes! Great feel, especially after injury issues. cushioned with enough support. Love the GL14!",
120217,5,07/09/2016,Perfection! I love my shoes! I am a young obese woman who always has foot pains. I recently got proactive about my health and started walking/jogging 4 miles a day. These shoes are so comfortable and I rarely have any pains in my feet. I also get compliments all day long when I am at work. I am a nurse so I am on my feet for 16 hours a day and could not be happier with my purchase. The shoes might be pricey but it was totally worth it!,
120217,1,07/07/2016,"Why only pink Barbie shoe for womans wide? I am so mad that you only have the Pink Barbie Color in 9.5 wide. I actually bought it and returned it. I tried, but it is not me. I have been waiting since the 12's as the the 13's were too narrow. I would bug my favorite store, and when I was checking on the arrival of the 14's, woman would come in and complain how the last year shoes were so narrow. You listened to making shoes wider, so please add more colors please!!  Love the shoe hate the color. Went back to New Balance. I will be back when you get more colors, same style as the 12,14 for wider feet.",
120217,5,07/05/2016,Great shoes! The shoes arrived just as pictured and are very comfortable and good quality!,
120217,5,07/04/2016,Brooks Forever A bit loose around the ankle. I'm hopeful it will change after my first few weeks.,
120217,5,07/03/2016,"Great shoes! I do HIIT, spin and I run in these shoes.  They are extremely comfortable and there was no breaking in time-- comfortable from the start.",
120217,5,07/03/2016,I would buy this again ,
120217,5,07/02/2016,"Fits and feels just like my glycerin 13s, love them! I run three times a week as a beginner, had ASICS for years and was sick of them costing 150 dollars and not lasting. Brooks fan from now on 😀",

120217,5,06/28/2016,"Glycerin 14 ........ greatest shoe I have ever worn, PERFECT The shoe is perfect fit, fits well immediately and am amazed how well it feels all day, evening and until I take them off to go to bed! I find nothing not great about the shoes. Am an older person with arthritis and almost don't know I have that with these shoes on, am an active person and shoes and being active is enjoyable now with these shoes. Many, many thanks for helping me with correct size, you were great!",
120217,5,06/27/2016,Love my new Glycerin 14 shoes.  Great fit & love the color I use these shoes for everyday wear.  I have high arches and plantar fasciitis and these shoes have made a big difference.,
120217,4,06/27/2016,first week not bad I'm an average runner I get in at least 27 miles a week. I've had this shoe for a week now not bad. I just wish it had better arch support I have high arch. other than that it's a great shoe. Light weight and great cushion.,
120217,5,06/25/2016,"walk the walk and you will truly talk the talk !! Im 60 yrs young  I'm not a jogger. I walk a lot.  These are the BEST tennis shoes I've ever had. Problem is I want not need more of these shoes !!!!  I liked the the ""13"" but I loved the ""14"".   I use them for walking and for work.  Thank you !!!!!",
120217,5,06/25/2016,"This is my third pair. Love them! Great support I have tried many different brands, but this one works and helps me with my knees and back issues. Brooks are the best for me.I'm on my feet all day.",
120217,5,06/24/2016,"My favorite so far! Brooks Glycerin are the shoes that I wear on a daily basis the most.  This pair, Glycerin 14, is by far my favorite.  They are lightweight and I love the color.  I'm going to order another pair because I like them that much!",
120217,5,06/23/2016,"Love Them!! In my profession, I am on my feet 12 hours a day.  Sometimes I stand in one spot for extended periods of time.  Brooks Glycerin is the first and only line of shoes that have carried me through the day without any pain whatsoever in my feet.  I cannot stress enough how pleased I am with these shoes.  This is my second pair and I will buy these from now on.  I walk on the outside of my feet and wear shoes along the outer edge.  These shoes work perfectly for me and my last (first) pair do not show any signs of wear in those areas.  I owned them for about a year and could not wait for the new Glycerin 14 colors to come out.  You will not go wrong with these shoes.",
120217,5,06/22/2016,Love as always! ,
120217,5,06/18/2016,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!! Did the sweep, bought all 3 colors! ",
120217,5,06/18/2016,Running and tennis playing shoe No complaints. Waited a good while for the new ones to come out. Most ppl play tennis in proper shoes. I feel I get better grip and control in my brooks,
120217,2,06/16/2016,"Beautiful but without comfort Rather than invest in the Glycerin 13, I eagerly awaited the 14. As soon as I saw the teal and purple color, I was SOLD! Had to have it. First impressions were great upon arrival, until I tried it on.My foot, depending on the brand, can go between a regular width or a wide width. I haven't had problems with regular width shoes in the past from Brooks, but this is an exception. The mid foot felt mostly okay (not something I would want to run in, but doable), but the toe box is exceptionally narrow and angled. Instantly big toe was pushing into the side of the shoe while leaving excess space on the lateral side of my foot. I tried cleaning around the house with them on, and decided these simply aren't the shoes for working out.I'm honestly in love with the design, though, and may consider keeping them for just running errands. I cannot say if the wider width would fix my concern, nor will I be trying as the pink and gray colors are not something I can get behind. If you have feet that err on the side of wide, I do not recommend getting anything other than a wide width in this shoe.",
120217,5,06/09/2016,"Nice long distance shoe Version 14 is significantly better than the 13. I loved version 11 & 12. The 13 felt stiff and not very cushioned to me and actually make my hips/knees hurt. The 14 has more flexibility and cushion. It fits great in the heal, and there is plenty of room in the forefoot. First run of 6 miles was awesome. I use these for daily training up to 15 miles on roads and also find the traction is good enough to use on trails. There is enough support in them that my feet/legs don't get sore during long runs.  I'm glad something changed from the 13, so that I can have my 'go to' long distance shoe back! Hope to get around 350 miles out of these like I have with previous versions.",
120217,5,06/09/2016,"very happy! run 3 times a week, comfortable. used brooks for 4 years now and very happy with the shoes",
120217,5,06/07/2016,"Comfortable fit, smooth ride I purchased these shoes after owning several pairs of glycerin 11's and 12's. I was not fond of the 13's so I tried out a different brand of shoes with many complications from changing to a lower heel drop. I am in love with the 14's! They offer the same smooth ride, excellent cushioning and overall feel that I loved in the Glycerin 11. I received them at the end of May and had a fantastic Memorial Day run over the Mackinac Bridge.",
120217,5,06/07/2016,Always love Glycerin !!! ,
120217,5,06/06/2016,"My favorite running shoe I run an average of 30 miles a week.  I have always been a Brooks Glycerin fan and have tried Mizuno, Hoka, Saucony but I keep coming back to Brooks.  I could run a race in these shoes straight out of the box.  They fit well like all previous glycerins but seem to have more cushion in the heel.  Glycerin 13s were disappointing in that they wore out fast, hopefully the 14s will hold up better.",
120217,5,06/03/2016,Fun and comfy shoe I wear these for road running. I hope to get 400 miles on them. Super comfy and fun colors.,
120217,5,06/01/2016,Love I will be wearing these for a 1/2 marathon this Sunday and they are sure to keep my feet feeling comfortable.,
120217,5,05/10/2016,"Better than the 13! I used this product for short and long distance runs.  It is significantly less stiff, and more flexible than the 13s.  Brooks said it was slightly narrower - I didn't notice at all.  Feels like there is more cushion than the 13s and it's lighter.  I'm replacing all my 13s with the new 14s.",
120219,5,12/22/2017,"Great fit, great color ",
120219,4,12/18/2017,"As expected Just like my last pair, it will likely take a few months to break them in. This pair hurts my toes after about an hour, where the crease hits. Hopefully this will subside after they are worn in.",
120219,5,12/12/2017,the best ,
120219,3,12/10/2017,"Smaller and narrower I wear these shoes for work (12) hr shifts. When I first put them on they felt a little snug, I replaced their insert with my orthotics and they felt much better. These shoes felt pretty good my first two shifts, but by the third I felt hobbled. I am going to try a size up, if that does not work I may try the men's shoes, since they make shoes wider for men.",
120219,5,12/07/2017,"Amazing. A perfect redesign. I LOVE these shoes. I am 5'7 and 130. I have custom orthotics due to several bad ankle sprains playing basketball when I was young. This shoe, version of this style,  by far is the best shoe ever. I wish I could afford to buy several more. Every redesign element was perfectly thought out and works incredible well. The new shoelace placement- brilliant. I hate having to wear other shoes. Nothing makes me feel like I can run,  go hard all day (job and Mom), and get home from work with energy to keep going.",
120219,2,12/05/2017,"Best sneaker ever.....until the '16s The Ariel is one of the best shoes I have ever found, but for some reason the 16 was made with a piece of cloth on the interior, outer side of the sneaker that rolls up when taking off the shoe.  It started within the first week of putting the sneaker on and off, now a year later is so creased that I had to buy thicker socks to keep if from digging into my foot.  - Loved my 14s, but they are worn out.  Waiting to see if the 18s will have this side cloth issue.......",
120219,3,12/04/2017,These shoes are not as comfortable as they used to be I've been having a problem with these shoes rubbing against my big toes. I will wait until the next model until I order a new pair a size larger. Until then I'm wearing my old shabby Ariels.,
120219,1,11/08/2017,Not the 16 model.  Not nearly what the prior models have bee This model not up to the previous models.  Been wearing arials for 15 years.   These are my tenth pair and by far the worst of your previous fleet.Will not buy another pair until 18 comes out.Please upgrade this shoe.,
120219,5,11/05/2017,Don't Trip I am on my feet 16+ hrs daily. I have plantars fasciitis and overpronation. I have no pain at the end of my work day. My ankles don't roll and I no longer trip. My balance is better than it ever has been and no my bavk/hip pain!!!! These shoes are worth every single penny!!!!,
120219,5,11/04/2017,"My second pair of this style This is my second time buying this style. Just like the first pair, I could wear them all day the first time I put them in. So comfy. Have had Achilles issues and this is the best shoe ever.",

120219,5,11/03/2017,"Just bought pair #2 I'm not a runner yet but do walk between 8-10moles at work. I bought the blue ones two years and they still fit / work great. Except my pinky toe made a hole somehow! Looool. I patched it, but today I bought the purple ones. I NEED more colors !",
120219,4,11/02/2017,"Great shoe but not for me I bought the Ariel on the recommendation of my foot doctor for over pronation and a painful fallen arch on one foot. It has great support snd nice styling but is a bit heavy. I am returning them because I have a narrow heel and despite a heavier sock, an orthodic and trying diffetent ways of lacing it still slips in both heels. I usually wear an 8 M but it felt a bit short. Got an 8.5 for the toe room. The 8 slipped a little but not as much. Ended up buying a different brand that runs narrower. I certainly would recommended the Ariel to others who don't need a shoe that is narrow in the heel.",
120219,5,10/26/2017,Ariel 16' OMG!!!  I have been wearing Asics for over 7 years on the recommendation of my foot doctor because of so many foot surgeries and problems but that is fixing to change.  My son bought me a pair of Brooks shoes for my birthday and I am so happy with them.  When I was fitted Randy knew exactly what shoe I needed just walking in the store.  I had absolutely no arch and was turning my left ankle in and hurting to the point of I didn't want to walk without pain meds.  But not no more!!!,
120219,5,10/15/2017,Love it! I am a severe overpronater that can wear these shoes without my orthotics.  I had been using another brand of support running shoes but these are the best I have found. I own a dog boarding Kennel and walk many hours a day on concrete floors and on trails through the woods.,

120219,4,10/08/2017,"I HAVE bought this shoe again and again I have bought these shoes for my nursing job since 2009.  I have to keep going sizes up to have them fit like they should and not too small, as is all wearables these days.  These give me the best support for my feet during my shift.",
120219,5,10/06/2017,"Great shoe Recommended by my podiatrist to help with foot stability.  Also wear a prescription orthotic insert.  I have found these to be the most comfortable shoes ever!  I will not even purchase any other brand. I normally wear size 11, but found I need to wear size 12 in these.  These are the best.",
120219,3,10/04/2017,Like Ariel's just why can't we have decent colors? I have a plate in one foot; flat footed both feet. Worn Brooks for years since the Chariots.  Even back then count get decent colors. Every other brand of shoe has decent colors except Brooks. And now this season they are tight.  I wear an 11 so how much bigger do I go?,
120219,2,10/02/2017,...no. The Ariel 14 has much more shock absorbing quality. ...not enough shock absorbing quality and not as high an arch as the Ariel 14. Not happy with the Ariel 16.NEVER CHANGE A WINNER like the 14's.,
120219,1,09/25/2017,No thank you Too tight on front half of shoe and toes feel narrow. I only wear brooks aerial and have been disappointed in last two they came out with. I have flat feet and my toes and heels are killing me in the aerial 16. I even have blisters. Yes I order half size up as always and tie length is fine but very tight fitting. I live brooks but I think I may have to switch and I really hate to leave....I am constantly on my feet and these shoes are killing me😢,
120219,5,09/15/2017,This is the only shoe I wear. I work on concrete all day.  This is the only shoe that allows me to do this with no pain.,
120219,3,09/11/2017,No I wouldnot ,
120219,5,09/08/2017,"Very comfortable First off, I got mine on sale.  I am very ecstatic seeing how much they really are.  This is my first pair of Brooks.  I have tried different style of this brand before and I thought it's only made for high arch foot so I stayed away from it. But I'm glad I tried them on again at the store and the Ariel 16 is so comfortable. I am a TTS 8.5 on any brand/style athletic shoes. I had to go 1/2 size (size 9) up on this 'cause they do run 1/2 smaller. I also got the D width D which is a plus. Very pleased with my purchase. Kudos to Brooks!",

120219,5,09/02/2017,Pleasantly Surprised I had two pairs of the Ariel 14 before this and was afraid I wouldn't like the new version. It fits quite nicely although they run quite small. I ordered a full size up from what I wore in the 14 and I could probably use a half size up still. I have narrow feet so the toe box is plenty roomy for me. The color of the shoe is much cuter in person than it appears online. I do hope they come out with more colors. I wear these shoes for 14 hour work days in a hospital. For the past few years they are the only shoes I'll wear. I pronate badly and have flat feet.,
120219,3,08/30/2017,"Not as good a Ariel 14's More snug than the 14's; toe box not as roomy even up a half size; do not seem to have as much cushioning so is harder on ball of my foot where I do have some arthritis.  Though I bought these and have worn them quite a bit, I keep going back to my old Ariels when my foot feels sore from the 16's!Contrary to another reviewer, I DO appreciate the darker colors as I also wear them at work and walk a lot on cement (hence the less cushioning observation).  I don't really want so-called ""women's"" colors on the job - the darker colors offered have been perfect for my needs!",
120219,5,08/28/2017,Ariel 16 I have been wearing Brooks shoes for past 20 years.  I do feel more comfortable in the Ariel because of the medial support.,
120219,4,08/25/2017,I've bought the Brook Ariel for years & will continue to buy ,
120219,5,08/22/2017,"Ariel wearer for 10 years plus I ran out to buy the Ariel 16 after seeing them on a friend who is another Ariel wearer who said ""these are sooo comfortable"".I can't believe I had to buy a 9.5 D when my shoe size is 8.5 M. I loved the Ariel 14 (size 9 D)  which was roomier in the toe box. In at least  ten years I only missed the Ariel 12.The Ariel 16  has my foot set in comfortably without the arch supports my Podiatrist recommended for the 14's.",
120219,5,08/17/2017,Finally! Finally found shoes that are wide enough and cushioned enough. Looking forward to many more purchases.,
120219,4,08/11/2017,"Happy Feet 👣 This is my first pair of Brooks running shoes. The Ariel 16 feel wonderful on my feet. I'm on my feet lot at work and I suffer from plantar fasciitis. I had surgery in 3/2017 worst mistake ever. I'm so glad I made this purchase, it waswell worth the investment.",
120219,4,07/31/2017,I only buy these shoes. I like these shoes so  much. They offer the right motion control for my feet.,
120219,5,07/31/2017,"Love these shoes!!  I have and will buy another pair. I do a lot of walk/run races and these shoes are the best for me.  I have done 5k, 10 milers, 10k and will do a half marathon with these shoes.  I got an extra pair to get them ready when the first pair has worn out.  Wish them came in other colors.  I love this color, but other colors I would wear them for other occasions.",
120219,4,07/27/2017,"Like the colors, comfortable. I read through the comments before purchasing.  I did order a half size up.  The size is good.  These are the shoes that my podiatrist has recommended I buy.  I did have the previous version (purple/pinkish).... compared to the previous ones, the arch in the newer ones are different.  It feels like the arch is not as high / supportive, even with my arch supports in.  When I stand for long periods of time, my arch starts to hurt pretty good.  I put the old ones on just to feel the difference, and it feels like my foot rolls inward in the new shoes.  When I'm walking I'm fine, it's just when I'm standing for long periods of time.",
120219,4,07/26/2017,Excellent support I highly recommend if purchasing this product that you go up a whole size and length and a whole size and width. I wear a 10 medium and had to go up to an 11 EE.,
120219,3,07/20/2017,Not Great ,
120219,4,07/13/2017,Heals are to heavy ,
120219,5,07/08/2017,"Perfect fit! I need really wide shoes and usually all I find are medium. These are perfect, provide great support, and let air flow.",
120219,5,07/05/2017,Very comfortable!! Also keeps my foot stable😉 ,
120219,5,07/05/2017,"Superb! Advice for all those seniors and otherwise that have balance, plantar faciitis and achilles tendonitis problems:  Take advantage of the ""motion control"" characteristics of this shoe.  This is coming from a senior that has all of the above, used a cane, lives in the country, falls a lot etc. I can not speak highly enough of this shoe.  Since purchasing I am now NOT using my cane, can do all the activities on the property that I use to be able to do and most important, no pain related to walking etc., and most important, I am confident.  Thank you Brooks for making this shoe available.",
120219,2,07/04/2017,"The 16 changed from previous model I liked the previous Ariel and had 3 pairs because it was wide enough (I have one foot slightly wider and much flatter than the other) than many ladies' running shoes and substantial.  I find the 16 narrower, shorter in the toe box, much less substantial to walk in/on.  It feels ""flimsy"".  Lacing system also is different and difficult to tie these slippery laces tight enough.   Unfortunately after purchase I had an illness so did not try these on or walk in them for months - didn't return (my fault) and will obviously have to locate another brand with a proper substantial construction, proper fit, better lacing system.",
120219,1,06/29/2017,Why did you change Ariel? I can't wear them anymore. Why did you decide to change them? Why not keep the old ariel and call the new one something else? It was the only shoe that ever worked for me but if designers keep making things the same way they are no longer needed -- so they have to make something new every once in awhile. I see this happen in almost all products after a few years. This was a huge mistake by whomever decided to do this. Fire them for this terrible idea.,
120219,4,06/18/2017,Comfortable Like the room in this shoe. I haven't worn these as much as the other pair I also purchased. But this one feels roomier. But I like the other pair a little better cause they don't feel like I'm on my toes. I do a lot of walking.,
120219,5,06/09/2017,"I have bought this shoe again and again I wear this every day & night EXCEPT not on the tennis court & not on ""date night"" with hubby.  Because of this, I need to replace them by 10-11 months.   Wish the support would last longer.....",
120219,5,06/09/2017,I  love these shoes. No problems at all ,
120219,5,05/24/2017,"Great Support Ariel was recommended by my orthopedic doctor because of my arthritic, flat feet.  They have helped reduce the pain in walking and in senior exercise classes.",
120219,5,05/01/2017,"The support is the best, especially if you are a nurse! The support that these shoes provide is wonderful, my feet pronate out and the strong heel holds them in and makes the shoes last longer. I have to buy new shoes at least once a year for support for my job and gym and I always choose Brook Ariel.",
120219,5,04/27/2017,Excellent Shoe Wear everyday.  Support and pronation control have corrected my knee problem.  This is my third pair.  Well worth the price.,
120219,1,04/21/2017,I liked the ariel 14. do not like the ariel 16. toe box I used them for work.. liked ariel 14. Could not wear  ariel 16. Have worn ariels for years. I wish they would not change them.,
120219,3,04/13/2017,Disappointed with this Ariel What happened to the good old Ariel?  I've worn Ariels since 2005 to stabilize my legs (arthritis).  The last model that was good was the 2012.  I am at a loss for shoes.  I wish Brooks could make a good shoe again.,
120219,5,04/10/2017,I love them! ,
120219,5,04/10/2017,My go to shoe! ,
120219,3,04/09/2017,Comfortable but the color looks like a men's shoes. Shoe is comfortable (thank you & thank you for 2E) but please make it look like a woman's shoe in the next version.The Adrenaline comes in pretty colors but the Ariel looks really ugly.Would like to buy a couple more pairs of Ariels but will wait for some pretty colors.Will have to buy the New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 v7 because they have more attractive colors.,
120219,5,04/06/2017,This is my third pair of the Ariel style shoes. These work well for my flat feet but I wear them out in about a year because I wear them almost constantly.,
120219,3,04/02/2017,"not for me These new Ariels cannot hold a candle to the original Ariels. They are definitely a size too small, but the main thing is that Brooks has changed the shape of the shoe so there is less room in the toes. They are not ""cushy"".... I have orthotics so I took the insoles out to put my orthotics in and it felt like I was walking on cement. If you liked the original Brooks Ariel sneakers you will not be happy with these.",
120219,5,04/01/2017,Great work out shoe ,
120219,4,03/24/2017,Still a good shoe The shoe is comfortable but doesn't seem to have as much support as the previous model.,
120219,5,03/15/2017,"A ""must have"" for working retail Ariel is by far the BEST shoe I have ever worn. I am a retail store manager and on my feet for several hours each day. For years I have been struggling with a lymphatic ankle (from a past injury), and could never find anything that would work for the ""long"" haul. I also deal with a tailors bunion on the other foot and metatarsal support is key. Two years ago I walked into ""Happy Feet"" in Tampa, Florida and they introduced me to Brooks Ariel. I was at the end of my rope, and tired of living with painful feet. They put me into a pair of Ariel's and I came back to life. The technology in this specific shoe is superior. I stand straighter, pressure is off of my hips and I feel increased stability when I walk.  Most of all my feet are HAPPY. I honestly can say that this shoe will be my ""forever shoe"" now. Yes, I dream of cute, trendy shoes....but happy feet are the best feet. Thank you for great customer service along with a fantastic product.",
120219,3,03/14/2017,"I would not buy again, not like my older Ariels ",
120219,5,03/09/2017,Comfortable surefooted have looked for s long for a shoe lik ,
120219,5,02/20/2017,"awesome update for the younger crowd Stylish update to the ariel 14! Love them! Perfect for my plantar pain. Love the new look, great colors for the younger crowd with foot pain. Finally a shoe that works like I need it to and I'm not embarrased of the look",
120219,5,02/02/2017,"LOVE THESE SHOES I absolutely love these shoes, I did have to order 1/2 size larger than usual as they recommend. I am a PE teacher toward the end of my career, and need the comfortable support desperately.",
120219,5,01/29/2017,"Will buy another pair when 2017 color comes out Compared to the 2014 model, the 2016 version went back to a much better shoe for people with bunions or other foot problems. 2014 had a small toe box the 2016 fits as it should. I did order a half size larger as suggested. I'm very happy with this year's cut and comfort. A bit much on the neon teal trim and the price increase, but I'm glad I bought them. If I like the color this fall, I'll buy another pair.",
120219,4,12/22/2016,"Love the shoe I get atleast 10,000 steps a day and use the shoes for pickleball.They give great arch support and pronation/stability control.The inside cushion does seem to flatten out a bit after a  couple of months.",
120219,1,11/29/2016,ugly colors I've worn the Ariel style for yrs but almost sent the current ones back because of the color. I needed new shoes so I kept them but they are so UGLY! I don't need cutesy pie little gym girl shoes but black and teal?!!! After many yrs of buying Ariel I won't buy them again if they keep coming out with odd colors that look so industrial. Not asking for sequins just something less color dominant.,
120219,1,10/21/2016,"Bring back Ariel '14 I've been an Ariel wearer for many years. These shoes have saved my life. My feet are very flat and with Ariels I can walk miles. HOWEVER, I cannot wear Ariel '16s at all. The fixed fabric strips on the outside of the shoes irritate bunionettes on both of my feet to the point that I've tried medium and wide and neither worked and I have returned both. I wore the medium for about a month hoping that my feet and the shoes could reach a detente. No luck. The wide was just too wide in the redesign for me to wear. It feels like both medium and wide are overcorrecting in that Ariel '16s are throwing my foot to the outside so there's no way to prevent the friction between bunionettes and shoes. I ended up buying several pairs of the distastefully colored pink Ariel '14 to wear until Ariel '18. IMO, the Ariel '14 was the absolute best of all of the Ariel designs I've worn over the years. Please bring back Ariel '14!!!",
120219,5,10/19/2016,"Exceeds Expectations! I couldn't be happier with these sneakers! This is my first Brooks purchase, based on my sister's recommendation & the reviews and these sneakers truly exceed my expectations. I am a physical therapist in a hospital setting & on my feet all day. I was looking for an alternative to my clogs & am most impressed by the support yet lightweight nature of these sneakers. I am not a sneaker person but find myself reaching for my Brooks more often than my clogs lately!",
120219,5,10/11/2016,Been waiting Been waiting for the 16 to come out.  Haven't been able to fit into them since the 12's.  This model is AWESOME!  I am ordering another pair so that if you make changes I can at least have 2 pairs that fit this time.First time out on the treadmill was able to get an hour of walking in in the brand new pair of shoes without any foot discomfort.  Orthotics fit in perfectly.  SO Pleased with this model.,
120219,5,10/11/2016,I can't believe how good my feet and ankles feel These are great work shoes. I have suffered with over pronation for years. Now my feet feel so much better when I have finished my shift,
120219,5,10/10/2016,Love this shoe I use this for the gym and walking. It's very comfortable and has excellent support.,
120219,4,10/10/2016,"Love the new Ariel '16 I walk 5-8 miles a day and love the shoes.I also use them for pickleball.I do not like the new lace holders on the tongue of the shoe. They get in the way. If they stay, they should be placed lower on the tongue.I may cut them because they are annoying and make it difficult to get the right tension on the shoe.I like the new color, but would also like another color option.",
120219,5,10/10/2016,"Very Good Shoe I had Brooks Ariel before.  My old ones had worn out and I needed new ones.  I couldn't find them in my size so I moved to another brand.  My knees started hurting.  I used the other brand for about 6 months.  My knees hurt the whole time.  Since I bought the new Ariel in September, my knees feel better.  They are still a bit achy but they don't hurt.",
120219,5,10/01/2016,Love the ariel shoes been wearing them for at least 10 years Dear ma'am and sirs. I have the shoes ready to be shipped back I recieved the wrong width I order 7.5 triple wide I had wore them for two days and then figured it out. I will send them back please send me the right width. I have been wearing ariels for asking as 10 years first time I was sent the wrong width. Still love the shoe just need the right width. Thanks. Judi johnson,
120219,5,09/15/2016,"finally the roomy 2E toe box is back! I have missed the ariel so much- the toe box in the 14 was much too narrow.  the toe box in the 16 is nice and roomy.  i am in love lol   low arch is perfect for my collapsed arches, no more arch inserts poking my arch in the neutral shoes. YAY!good cushioning , so comfortable!  Dont change this one brooks, wide width wearers need this toe box! :)It does run a half size small.  i was initially disappointed about that but now in the right size I am thrilled with this shoe!",
120219,2,09/08/2016,mixed feelings Cant review much because they are a half size too small then I wore in the ariel 14 and currently wear in the dyad 8.  toe box room seems more comfortable then the ariel 14 but they could have opened it up a bit more.  the size 9 i just receives is too small length wise.  my big toe also rubs on the edge of the shoe on my left foot.  will see how this is in a half size upreturn process with brooks is tedious they use the postal service which is the slowest cheapest shipping you can choose -also - they say it will take about 2-3 weeks for my refund.  cant order a new pair till then.brooks should do exchanges since their return process is so slow,
120221,4,11/29/2017,"Fantastic, comfortable shoes These shoes are very comfortable and felt good the first time I put them on. They are good for longer speedwork (e.g., tempo runs) and a great marathon racing flat for those who need a little more cushion and/or support.The one main drawback is the lack of traction. These shoes slip quite easily on wet ground. While I realize shoes will slip on wet ground, there is room for significant improvement in that department with these shoes. I just ran a marathon and the ground was wet and I felt like every time I pushed off, I was losing so much energy due to lack of traction. Fix this and these shoes will be perfect!",
120221,5,11/10/2017,"Please make these shoes in other colors, I love them. I am a tennis player and kept returning  tennis shoes (from other tennis brands) because they kept hurting my feet. Brooks does not make tennis shoes, but I have 2 other pairs of Brooks, one for running and one for walking. I took a chance and ordered this shoe online because of the 90 day policy, fully expecting for it to be uncomfortable because it's not a tennis shoes (it's a training shoe), but also because my feet are a bit wide and this shoe comes in regular size. Surprise, suprise, they fit perfect, and they are wonderful to play tennis in them. I get so many compliments on how they look. I would love to buy more colors, but the only other color is yellow and I hate yellow. Please, please, make these shoes in other pretty colors.",
120221,3,10/17/2017,"Nice Shoe I had to return these because the arch was too high for me.  If you have high arches, they will be perfect.",
120221,5,10/01/2017,I would definitely buy this shoe again. I speed walk in 5K & 10K events. This weekend I will speed walk in my first half marathon. I have tried Mizunos and ASICS. This shoe has decreased my mile pace by 1 minute. Your 'silly' test questions really work.,
120221,5,06/30/2017,"I would buy this again comfortable and light weight. colors are limited, I prefer less pink, and maybe a blue or red for the womens. But again I ran well in them and had no issues with my feet or knees. With the Brooks 90 day trial run, and ease of return, icing on the cake.",
120221,2,03/31/2017,"Not a good replacement for the Racer ST5s I've worn the ST5s for a few years, and I alternated the ST5s with the Ravenna before Brooks ruined the Ravenna.  Now, they have discontinued the ST5s, which I loved, and replaced it with a racer with stability (a good thing) but it has too much cushioning for my preference.  Within a mile of running in a new pair, my toes and balls of my feet started to go numb.  I am having a serious issue of finding shoes that don't cause my toes to go numb because shoe manufacturers are putting too much cushion in their shoes.  I don't know why Brooks has to change things that work so well.  Also, I would really like some color options besides pink -- not all women like pink!  I also tried the men's option to get away from the pink -- it is wider, which I also like; however, my toes also started to go numb after running in them for ~ 1 mile.  Later that night, the balls of my feet ached, and my calves are sore too from trying to counteract the cushioning and the lack of responsiveness in the shoes.  Bottom line: if you like responsive, lightweight shoes with some stability, then these are probably not the shoes for you; however, if you like lightweight shoes with some cushion, these could work for you.Background: avid runner, 6 marathons, 1 trail 50K, typical easy work week run: 5-7 miles",
120221,5,03/11/2017,"hallelujah I found my shoe!!! I am an avid runner, both on roads and trails. I used to swear by the Racer STs for at least five years and was SO disappointed when those were discontinued. When I found these, I was cautiously optimistic. After one run I was thanking my lucky stars!! These are a major upgrade from the Racer ST's and I love the styling. They are super light yet feel like they give me some motion control and support. I have a wide foot so the Hyperion's are too narrow for me, even though I love the looks of those too. The Asteria's fit me perfect and are comfy out of the box. I am ordering a second pair to save for Boston next month. Love these, please keep making them!!",
120221,5,03/09/2017,"Lightweight & comfortable Have always loved Brooks running shoes. Had great experience with Defyance several years ago but couldn't find another shoe that comfortable. Finally have with Asteria! Love how lightweight it is and very comfortable. I have a narrow foot and it fits perfect! Have done mostly indoor runs due to weather, but no problems when I've gotten outdoors. Highly recommend!",
120221,3,10/26/2016,"Not the shoe for me, but good for speed The Asteria was a great light weight shoe.  It was great for my pace.  However, after a few runs I had developed shin splints.  I got some custom insoles, but still had issues with my shins and knees.  I switched back to my old Launch 3's and the issues subsided. These were the suggested shoes for me after my shoe finder results, but I just don't think they are for me.  Returning and going back to my Launch 3's.",
120223,5,12/19/2017,This is my second pair of these shoes I have structural hip/leg/foot problems and this is the only shoe I've found that provides me with neutral support and the width I need to keep me in alignment.  I have the charcoal with pink and they look nice enough for all the places I wear them.  This is about the only shoe I wear and I wear them EVERYWHERE!  They are comfortable and I am able to be on the go all day long with them.,
120223,1,12/15/2017,Dyad 9 is different that previous versions I've been getting Dyads for years. I was warned that the Dyad 9 was narrower than previous versions and I did need to get the wide size for the first time. I am now shopping for new shoes because my feet  are sore at the end of the day. My foot doctor also noticed that they are still too narrow around the toes for me.,
120223,3,12/05/2017,Dyad 9 Review I've been wearing these for years with custom orthotics. This pair seems more narrow. I will be ordering the wide to compare. Hopefully they work! Love my Brooks!,
120223,1,11/24/2017,I can't wear these I have always worn the Dyad until this one.  They are uncomfortable and don't fit me right. I can't find the 8's anywhere and I can't find any other shoe to replace it so I've been plagued with injuries due to improper fit. Could you please return to the old style?,
120223,2,11/23/2017,Not the dyad 8 comfort I am disappointed in this version. The dyad 8 wasz perfect for me. I have difficulty finding the right shoe. I had it with the 8. The 9 doesn't have the cushion that I need.,
120223,4,11/20/2017,Love them but took time to get used to new feel. ,
120223,5,11/18/2017,I have bought this product since it was the Dyad 7 I love how you have reinforced the top of the shoe where the big toe hits.  I had problems in the past where my toe would go through the mesh.I wish you would go back to the insert that you made for the Dyad 8.  It is much better quality and absorbs shock much better.,
120223,2,11/08/2017,"Bring Back the Dyad 8s! Please!!! I LOVED my Dyad 8s! They were a substantial, cushiony shoe, with great support, that wore, and wore, and wore. No breaking in necessary. Being a newbie, I didn't know the veteran's tip of buying multiple pairs if you find the perfect fit & other attributes. Ordered the Dyad 9s and tried them on yesterday. :(  It was uncomfortable just standing in them, and more so doing a few down-and-backs in the length of the running store. I Returned them on the spot in the store & had the sales associate order Ghost 10s. The Ghosts felt marvelous on, and even better once I started moving. Mileage will tell if they hold up as well as Dyad 8s. They are a lighter-weight shoe, so the level of support might be a bit different. If they continue to wear well, will definitely get a 2nd pair! *Note: Ghosts have a wider toe box, so those with wide feet might be able to try on & wear a Normal width.",
120223,5,11/08/2017,This is pair #3 for me I have wide feet and bunions -- these are one of the few shoes that can accommodate them with good support.,
120223,1,11/05/2017,"Seems like Brooks is cost cutting My foot and ankle doctor recommended the Brooks Dyad and I started in the Dyad 8 a couple of years ago. They were fantastic, and I bought 2 more pairs while I could find them. They are very supportive and have great cushioning. I bought the Dyad 9. I do like the gray color instead of the Dyad 8 colors BUT Brooks has really gone down with this shoe. It seems like they have tried to cut costs by leaving out all the cushion and they did something with the sole so that it hurts my feet instead of feeling great. Please go back to the older design. Some of us really need the older style of the Dyad 8.",

I started with the Dyad 7 which were great, and on to Dyad 8 which were ok, and now I have the Dyad 9 which are very uncomfortable due to the fact that my 2E wide are not that wide at all. The toe box is way smaller! Also, I've yet to get a pair that the left toe doesn't end up in a tear. Very disappointed! ☹️",

120223,1,10/06/2017,"What happened to this shoe? I've bought the Dyad for the last 8 years.  I don't know what's up with the design of this shoe.  Have always bought the D width.  With the 9 I had to by a EE.  They still don't feel wide enough when my feed start to swell a little.  Plus the rubberized trim on the outside of the shoe is tighter than the fabric part so after wearing them for an hour or so it starts to rub on the toes.  I wear orthotics so this is the shoe my foot doctor recommended.  Going to tell him not to recommend to any other patients.  Brooks, go back to the old design.",

Needless to say, I've had every version since. I used to be able to wear them comfortably without breaking them in, then about model 7 things started to feel weird. However, I LOVE the 9's! They fit right away, no breaking in or weird discomfort. I have wide feet and everything felt great in these. But Brooks, PLEASE someday give us cool colors in these shoes like all the rest of yours :-)",
120223,5,10/05/2017,"Use For Plantar fasciitis I have chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis. The dyad is what the Doctor ordered as far a stability. I ordered a size bigger after being professionally fitted at a Brooks store, they fit perfect. Very nice arch support, it's the only shoes in which I don't need to add inserts.",
120223,2,09/29/2017,"Not the same as previous models I have worn Dyads for years both with and without orthodics and have loved them (OK, other than the poor color choices most years) but when I got the new Dyad 9s they were much narrower than my 8s and felt tight and the toe box was too small.  I happened to find a pair of Dyad 8 online and ordered them and they fit great.  Unless this is fixed I will have to shop for a different brand/style as the new Dyads do not work at all for me.",
120223,2,09/22/2017,"So Disappointed Like any review, this is specific to my own experience so here is some background info for context:  I have feet that are very difficult to fit for shoes.  I have extra wide feet with a high in-step and low arches.  I switched from New Balance to Brooks Dyad a few years ago and have gone through at least 4 pairs since then.  What I loved about them was that they were ready to go the instant I put them on.  Unfortunately that is not the case with the Dyad 9s.  I bought my usual 8.5 EE, and here is what I noticed:1. The shoes looked longer and narrower than previous versions.  I measured and compared with my 8's.  The sole was a tad narrower and just a bit longer.  I couldn't reliably compare the uppers because my old shoes had conformed to my feet, but they felt narrower and gave me blisters on my pinky toe.  Interestingly, this directly contradicts one of the Q&A's on this shoe posted on 2016/10/07 when someone asked about the toe box width, and Brooks responded ""The Dyad 9 toe box is a bit wider than the toebox in the Dyad 8.""  It certainly feels narrower to me.2. The shoes felt stiffer and less cushioned than before.  I've worn them several times now, and they still don't feel broken in and actually hurt my feet.  My experience contradicts another Q&A about flexibility posted on 2016/11/15, and Brooks responded, ""These are more flexible than the Dyad 8.""  NOPE.I don't know if the fundamental design changed or if the manufacturer changed materials that impacted the final product.  Whatever happened, I hope Brooks corrects it in the next model.  I am so disappointed that these might have to be returned, but I don't know what I'll wear instead.",
120223,3,09/20/2017,"They're ""ok"" They are ok. Not the best by Brooks, that's for sure. I prefer the Dyad 7 the best. The Dyad 8 was better than this one as well, but still the Dyad 7 was the best.",
120223,5,09/04/2017,"Fits my wide feet and provides nice cushioning on the soles I spent hours in the store trying on Merrils, Keens, Brooks etc. Finally saw these in the sale rack and tried them on and I love them. I need a shoe with a very wide toe box but all the wide Brooks just felt like slippers with no support. These fit a wide ball of the foot while keeping my foot snug around the rest of the shoe and my high arches. The mesh seems like it would stretch to accommodate wide feet but it didn't have to on me. I usually wear an 8.5 and the 8.5 is a perfect fit with a lightweight sock. The bottoms feel really cushy but are not as bulky and cumbersome as the other Brooks I tried on. Great sneakers.",
120223,1,08/29/2017,Painful I am having the same problem as Clare from Albuquerque.They are the most uncomfortable shoes I have bought. I have had to have my orthotics adjusted because of the pain when I wear them. It feels that my heel is coming out when I walk and I am forever pulling my socks out.,
120223,2,08/04/2017,"Changes on 9 make it impossible to wear Dyads were my go to shoe.  I have owned about 12 pairs of the Brooks Dyad 8.  I loved that shoe with my orthotics.  The new changes to the 9 have caused severe pain in my forefoot???? Not sure why.  Please, go back to the 8 framework.  I will shop another shoe until an upgrade to the 9.",
120223,3,07/31/2017,"This style has changed I have purchased and used the Dyad style for several years now and it has been a good style for me.  The past 2, the Dyad 8 and Dyad 9, wear differently.  The soles get shredded when I walk on the treadmill and little pieces of rubber fall wherever I walk and in a little pile behind the treadmill.  The sizing is also larger, I feel like the toe box is sort of flopping in front of my toes and I have been wearing the same size for years without issue.Finally, I was disappointed that because I wear a wide width, I did not have a selection of color.  I bought the only color that was available, but never would have selected that color if there was a choice.",
120223,1,07/30/2017,Don't waste your money on this shoe I don't usually write reviews but I am so upset with this product that I needed to share my experience. I have only had these shoes one week and I am ready to trash them!  They are anything but comfortable.  My feet have never hurt so badly in shoes either new or old.  I am very disappointed as this have been a very expensive lesson in not to purchase Brooks shoes.  When I went looking for information on Brooks shoes the only sites are Brooks sites so that should tell you something.  Getting an independent review is difficult at best. Looking for new shoes.,
120223,1,07/07/2017,"Dyad 9 I've been wearing Dyad shoes for a few years now.  They were wonderful.  When I wore the Dyad 9, my back and legs were aching within a few days.  Started getting calluses on my feet where I've never had that problem before.  I had to change to another brand of shoe.  It works okay, but not as good as the Dyad 8.  Please bring back the Dyad 8style.",
120223,4,06/28/2017,"Wide Foot, Long Running, Underpronator- this is your shoe I have 2E wide feet and it is very hard to find good running shoes that don't hurt. I started with Dyad 2 years ago when I was training for my first half marathon.  I love They are pretty heavy, is shoe for long runs. It is a very sturdy heavy shoe. The only downfall is the fun colors are never in my size.",
120223,2,06/24/2017,Smaller and slimmer than my Dyad 8. Not as cushiony either. ,
120223,1,06/23/2017,"Bring back the Dyad 8!!! Like Clare from New Mexico, I wore Dyads for five or more years. I switched to them from New Balance and just loved them. I cannot even get  my feet and my orthotics into the 9s, much less run in  them, partly because of the more streamlined toebox and partly because the shoe is not as deep as the  8 was. People who wore Dyads have feet that are tough to fit and the last thing we want or need is a ""streamlined"" shoe. The 9 was a complete waste of money for me, and I am back to wearing New Balance. Thank goodness one company - not you - cares about runners with feet that are really hard to fit.",
120223,3,06/21/2017,Not so sure about the nines. I ordered a half size larger but my orthotics still don't fit right in them. I have worn Dyads for years and this is the first time they have disappointed me. I'm not sure if I can make them work for me. I do like the way they look...,
120223,2,06/19/2017,"big disappointment I thought it was just me. I've been wearing the dyad 8 for four years and were perfect. after reading the reviews on the comparsion btw the 8 and 9--I agree with EVERYONE. It felt different from the minute i put it on. my feet hurt and they NEVER did with the 8. Yes, PLEASE Brook bring back the Dyad 8 and name it Dyad 8a PLEASE. My feet with thax you",

120223,4,06/08/2017,"Great distance shoe, but.... I have worn Dyad's for nearly 10 years and won't stray from them; however, the colors of the shoe are always plain and drab.  It would be nice to see a pair of Dyads in some flashy colors.  I have a flat foot and this seems to provide me with the best comfort for distance running.",
120223,4,05/22/2017,"Bouncy & Lightweight My old Dyad pair started to get holes by the toes, time to get the same thing again - but wait! A new style number and some reviews say it fits different! Turns out they fit just fine, I have not noticed anything funny about the fit. Love that the manufacturing has shifted out of China. The only reason I assigned four stars rather than five is the color, the navy & magenta is just OK.",
120223,1,04/14/2017,I am glad I am not the only one! I had the dyad 8 and loved them with the orthotics. Now I am in extreme pain. My orthopedic dr. has tweeked my orthotics various times and nothing makes these shoes comfortable for long. Now the arthritis in my big toe is starting again because of the pressure on the side of the toe. I had none of these problems with the dyad 8,
120223,1,03/26/2017,"Bring back the 8 pretty please... I am so disappointed with the Dyad 9. I have worn the Brooks Dyad for about 5 years continuously. With my flat feet, orthotics and plantar fasciitis, finding shoes has always been a nightmare. With the older models of the dyad, I never even needed to break them in, they fit great, were comfortable, and off I went. This model I could tell was different in how my foot sat in the show from the time I removed the inserts. My heel did not fit into the shoe with the orthotic as it did in the Dyad 8 (the shoe was a terrible sock eater). It went downhill from there. Within hours my feet hurt and the pressure points were incredibly uncomfortable. I went home and changed back into the Dyad 8 and my feet were happy again. I am dreading having to find another shoe to wear that is comfortable for my feet, and super sad that these changes were too much for me.",
120223,5,03/24/2017,"great shoe even after breaking ankle and heel I need these shoes just for every day living. Whether  I'm working or not , these shoes gives me the support  and stability  I need to walk daily. I have screws in my foot, so it is very comfortable  for me to wear and get back to daily tasks.",
120223,4,03/19/2017,Blue shoe I really like the shoe it might just be a little big or wide in the toe area only. But still works. I also ordered another pair of shoes from sol solutions. Been over  3 weeks and still not in. When I ordered these myself I got in 3-4 days. Seems odd that it would take that long to get from store . Wont order from store again.,
120223,2,03/15/2017,"Very Disappointed Very disappointed in the DYAD 9's.  I wear an orthotic in my shoes and was told this was the shoe to wear.  I tried the 8's and it was true.  I thought I had found a new best friend.  Boy was I wrong.  The 9's were so uncomfortable that I hated to eve put them on.  After I did wear them by back hurt.  You can tell the construction is different just from looking at the sole. I returned them and found the 8's on another website as they are not sold anymore by Brooks.  Same thing happened to me with the Adrenalines.  I wore them for over 10 years but the 15 and 16's are not the same as they used to be and therefore I can't wear them. Not sure where I will go now as these shoes are not cheap and hard to return once worn, plus I need a wide width. Brook's, why change something when it isn't broke????  Feeling very broken hearted...",
120223,3,03/13/2017,"had dyad 8 fit great, dyad 9 not so good The Dyad 9 is not working for me.  I have special inserts that I can't wear in the dyad 9's. The shoe is also way too tight across the ball area causing my left foot a lot of pain.The dyad 8 fit just right - size 11 wide.  do you have any more of these???",
120223,1,03/08/2017,"Epic Fail Epic fail!  I'm so disappointed.  Dyad was my shoe for years.  It was the first shoe I ever found that had a wide enough toe box for my wide feet.  Then came Dyad 8 and all that went away.  I had hope that with Dyad 9 they might have corrected their errors, but no it's worse.  Not only is my supposedly 2E width shoe narrow in the toe box, it's so narrow in the mid foot that my arch actuall rests on the side of the shoe.  Brooks please please pull out your old designs!",
120223,2,03/04/2017,"Stiff and uncomfortable The shoe is very stiff with little to no arch support.  Just walking around my house, the shoe felt very clunky with a clunking noise to match every step.  There is also stitching that rubbed against my toes.  I bought these for work because I'm a nurse who's on her feet all day.  One day of wearing them around the house was enough to know these would not be comfortable, and I returned them.",
120223,1,03/01/2017,"Disappointed in this shoe I have been wearing Brooks Dyads for almost a decade now and was thrilled when I first found them as I have very wide feet and narrow heels. These were the only sneakers I found that fit properly and comfortably. However, this DYAD is not the same as the others. The shoe is narrower and even a half size up doesn't accommodate the width of my foot. I have returned them and will have to look elsewhere for sneakers unless Brooks revamps them and makes a sneaker that is truly for wide feet. I would not recommend this shoe to any one with extra wide feet. Look around and see if you can find some Dyad 8s or 7s instead.",
120223,1,12/15/2016,"Disappointed in the DYAD 9 I have worn DYADs for years and have previously loved them. Whenever changes were made to the shoe, it has usually been cosmetic. The changes for the DYAD 9 have made this just another shoe. The insert is thinner and there's not much cushion. The toe area is much narrower for the same shoe size. I am very disappointed and I hope  that changes are made to revert to the previous design.",
120223,5,11/17/2016,"Best Shoe for Bad Feet These shoes are like running on a cloud.  I have high arches, wide feet, and a pretty impressive bunion on one foot.  These shoes keep me on the treadmill  for an hour.  Compared to the other stability shoes I tried, these feel slightly taller and wider with a lot more cushion on the arch.  They're not snug at all, but I did go up half a size from what I usually buy.  I really love these shoes.  Another reviewer said the toe box is narrower than a previous model.  I can't comment on that, but I did want to add that these shoes don't irritate my bunion.",
120223,5,10/19/2016,Love the shoes I have a high arch and wear inserts in these shoes.  I do Zumba exercise classes a few times a week in them and they work great.  My only problem is that they squeak when I walk around the house in them on hardwood and tile floors. It's kind of annoying.  This happened with my last Brooks Dyad shoes too.,

120223,1,10/13/2016,"Not as comfortable as Dyad 8 Wanted to get a jump on next season because I like the colors of Dyad 9.  I have Dyad 8 which I have used all summer for daily, 3-4 mile walks.  However, the Dyad 9 has several inside toe box seams which are extremely rough.  It doesn't feel like there is any lining or padding.  I could tell immediately that these rough spots would cause blisters very quickly.  I returned this pair since I don't really need them right now.  I have to wear leather in the winter because ventilated cloth is way too chilly for twenty degree weather.  I""ll wait to see if any improvements are made by next spring.  If not, I'll be trying to get the Dyad 8 if it's still available.",
120223,3,10/11/2016,"Not the Dyad 8, Unfortunately I have been a dedicated Dyad 8 wearer for years now. I have what I consider ""bad feet"" and a bad lower back, and I am always on my feet and hiking across campus as a college professor, necessitating a good shoe. Shoe shopping has always been a miserable process since most of the supposedly supportive, comfortable shoes don't fit my super high arches and super wide feet. Dyad 8, though, was wonderful, even if not rated for high arches. Unfortunately, the Dyad 9 is not your Dyad 8. It is stiff, less cushioned, and TOO NARROW. Dyad 8s needed a bit of breaking in out of the box but were wearable. The Dyad 9 is uncomfortable. If I loosen the laces to make the toe box more comfortable, I can still feel the crush and then the shoe is too loose in the heal. The new material around the heal is not as comfortable as the smooth older material, and the heal area feels at least a half inch too low from how high it rose in the past; it should be closer to the ankle for comfort and support. To add to this, the most exciting part about the new update was the protective toe patch since a number of customers (including myself) whose toes point upwards tended to poke holes in the expensive shoes! I had taken to putting padding to prevent this issue. Unfortunately, the protective toe patch is too high to keep my toe from poking through eventually. I didn't care for the color but bought them anyway in hopes that these would be a slightly improved Dyad 8. These are not.",

For the first time I ordered them and for they first time ever they are not as comfortable. Dyad's have been ""my shoe"" for a decade and have always been comfortable right out of the box until this pair. However, I was excited to see the toe reinforcement since the big toe area on every pair I've owned developed a hole. As I work to break this pair in hopefully my big toes will still be covered by the time I get there!? Love the color and design.",

120223,5,10/07/2016,"Post CAM Boot - This should be your shoe! I have never spent this much money on a pair of sneakers in my life. However after an ankle injury that put me in a CAM walker boot for almost 6 months I am extremely unstable and wearing a brace so I needed something with a wide base and lots of points of contact with the ground. I also needed a shoe with lots of support and comes in a wide width. This is the shoe. I went and got fitted at a specialty athletic shoe store in town and hands down this shoe wins for color and style, comfort and stability. The sole on these shoes is HUGE, like the most contact with the ground one can get. Which, if you have balance and muscle issues is a good thing.  I have been wearing solely these shoes for the past month at work, at home and at all of my physical therapy and doctor's appointments and it is comfortable and supportive. Something that could be changed is that it is super stable but not the most flexible shoe and I am working on flexibility so that could be easier in a more traditional athletic shoe. The other more cosmetic feature that I don't like is that the inside sole of the shoe is a straight white, which when looking down makes one feel like they are standing on the outside of their feet. Because balance is an issue for me and probably other people who buy this shoe, my mind and muscles don't always talk to each other appropriately and my balance is thrown off when I look down at my feet because my mind makes me think I am leaning toward the outside of my foot.Otherwise I am happy with the shoes, I feel they are worth the price and will repurchase these or whatever version there is of these available when I need to replace them.",

I am disappointed in the new version.  I used to wear Asics and they went to the narrow toe box so I switched to Brooks. Unfortunately, I cannot get another Dyad 8 in my size. The cushion is still there and there is room for my orthotics. I am a teacher and on my feet all day on concrete so I really need a comfortable shoe.

120225,5,10/31/2017,"My first Brooks & my feet are in love I bought Ghost and Launch. My feet are more narrow than medium width. I like solid arch support. Between the two pairs, I kept Ghost and returned Launch mainly due to shoe weight and initial fit/feel. These have not disappointed. After a day of walking, my feet don't hate me and I can go a second day. My ""other"" non-Brooks shoe definitely brought about more foot fatigue.",
120225,5,10/31/2017,"Love it I have all ghosts since #6 and this is by far the best. I hope the next one is more like this. The 10 is too mushy and glycerin like. I have all glycerin shoes since the 11 and that is what I liked about them being different-when a little extra support is needed go ghost, when tou want extra cushion a d flexibility go glycerin",
120225,1,10/30/2017,Not true size I can't wear them they are to small I already have this same pair in 9.5 so I am wearing my old ones,
120225,4,10/30/2017,I would buy this product again. ,
120225,5,10/30/2017,i buy this shoe over and over again I have been running cross country in the Brooks Ghost series for seven years now and wouldn't want any other show. It is comfortable and provides great support for long distance runs. The tread on the show lasts a while before having to get a new pair. Also helps that the Brooks Ghost series comes in cool colors. #ReviewSweeps,
120225,2,10/29/2017,"Not like previous models I have been wearin the Brooks Ghost shoe since probably the Ghost 3. I used to run a lot more and now jog only about 6 miles per week. I kept ordering these shoes despite the slightly high price for casual jogging because they were tried and true. For some reason, this model just doesn't fit like the previous models did. I thought that with breaking them in and adjusting the laces I'd be able to get a good fit but after about a month of wear, they still hurt. My foot slides when I'm walking yet it's too tight and causes sharp pain along the medial ball of my foot when running. Disappointed.",
120225,5,10/28/2017,"A quality shoe that does the job and improves my run I have been a casual runner for 20 years. This is my third pair of Ghost 9s. Typically I am cheap, but I have learned that it's woth the investment in good running shoes. I'm currently training for a half marathon and was experiencing knee pain in cheaper, less supportive shoes. As soon as I bit the bullet and replaced my aging pair of Ghost 9's, I immediately felt the difference in my joints. I also order online for narrow width, which is hard to find in stores. Before switching to narrow width shoes, I often rolled my ankles and even had several sprains. I had not had this problem since wearing a better fitting shoe.",

120225,5,10/25/2017,I 💜 Brooks Running Shoes! Bought my first pair of Brook's in 2009 and have not bought anything else since! I love the Ghost edition specifically because it has a high arch support! Most comfortable shoes ever!,

120225,3,10/23/2017,"Ok for sale price Shoes are lightweight, well cushioned in the heel, but would be more comfy if there was some additional cushion in the ball of the foot. I run about 15-20 miles a week, typically 3-6 miles at a time. A few times a month, I'll do a longer run (up to 10 miles)... These are fine up to 3 miles, but aren't cushioned enought in the ball of the foot for longer distances",

This is my second pair of Brooks Ghosts, and they hold up really well. Their comfortable, they're supportive, and I wore my last pair out completely without even realizing it because they still weren't bothering my knees and joints. Couldn't recommend more highly! This is a GREAT deal too. #reviewsweeps",

120225,3,10/20/2017,First time wearing brand First time wearing Brooks but have heard so much about them I always wanted to try My feet feel amazing after 10-12 hr shift at hospital all except the area at big toe area the material rubs the top of my big toe and makes them sore Trading them for different style We will see how it goes,
120225,5,10/20/2017,Awesome This is a great shoe. It fit me well (I have wide feet and fat toes). They barely needed to be broken in. Highly recommend them!,
120225,5,10/18/2017,"I like them! My professional foot measurement suggested I try a 7. My toes were too close to the front edge. The 7.5 fits great. The heel is very comfortable, my heel width is slightly narrower than average. The front width is very roomy and comfortable. There is plenty of room for a full length arch support sport insole.",
120225,5,10/18/2017,"I'm not running. I'm floating! This is my first pair of Brooks and I LOVE them! I do a lot of cross training and agility work. As I'm getting older, my feet were starting to ache and it was working it's way up to my knees. My husband and a ton of friends said I needed to buy better shoes and recommended Brooks. Well, problem solved! I needed more cushion support on the ball area of my feet as well as my arch due to all the jumping and running. I purchased a size 8 because I usually wear a 7.5 and that's what the true size calculator recommends. I would have been fine with a 7.5 (I prefer my shoes snug) but the 8 will be fine. One last thing, I tried on EVERY brand of sneaker in the store to see if brooks were really worth it and the answer is YES! No other athletic shoe even came close to the support and cushion these shoes have.",
120225,5,10/18/2017,Great for me!! ,
120225,3,10/17/2017,"Didn't work for me; Went back to the Ravenna I had the Ravenna 7s and loved them, but after I wore a hole through the upper, decided it was time for a new pair. My friend swears by the Ghost, but unfortunately they didn't work for me. I initially ordered my normal running shoe size and they felt a full size too small - my toes were pushed up against the front of the toe box. I think the problem for me was the hard toe cap. I ordered a full size up and while the toe box felt good, the shoe didn't hug my foot enough and there was heel slippage. I then tried the same size in a Narrow, but that didn't work either. I also realized that the Ravenna gives enough cushioning and I don't need more; and actually it's easier for me to feel my strike with less. I just got the Ravenna 8s and have run in them twice and they are perfect! Staying with that model from now on. #ReviewSweeps",
120225,5,10/17/2017,I like this shoe so much I bought a second pair. I always bought Asics but when I went to Super Jock-n-Jills they didn't have my size.  They suggested I try Brooks Ghost 9 since I want a pair of neutral running shoes.  Once I put them on I knew they were the right shoe for me.,
120225,5,10/17/2017,I would buy this product These shoes are very nice and comfortable. I am pleased with them. The only thing I would say is that the padding feels a bit cheaper than my previous Brooks but that is likely because those shoes were more expensive. #ReviewSweeps,
120225,3,10/17/2017,"Different material quality with different colors? I purchased the Ghost 9 in black in December of 2016 and just recently purchased the Ghost 9 in this color since they were on sale and I had put plenty of miles on the black ones- which I LOVE. This shoe just feels different all around than the black ones. The material doesn't feel as durable and the heel strike doesn't feel as comfortable and controlled. I was actually considering returning it but have continued to run in it thinking it might conform. After more than 30miles in this shoe, I have yet to have that effortless run ""feel"" like I did in the black Ghost 9. Call me crazy?!",

They started to look pretty beat up and my feet were hurting, as I started to get more serious about my running I did research on sneakers and kept coming across Brooks Ghost 9 running shoes. I decided to order them and wasn't expecting to feel much different, boy was I wrong! After several runs, I can say that these sneakers are amazing and the type of shoes you run in make a big difference! The Ghost 9 sneakers are so comfortable and the amount of cushion in them feel like clouds on my feet. I love these shoes and I will continue to stick with Brooks running sneakers from now on. Thank you for making such a great pair of shoes!",

120225,5,10/12/2017,"I love the Ghost. It is my go-to shoe. I love the Ghost. Most automated fit programs put me in a more supportive shoe, but based on wear and feel, I love the Ghost. I had to switch from the Saucony Ride. It has an 8 mm heel to toe drop, which put strain on my Achilles. The Ghost has a 12 mm heel to toe drop and it has helped immensely. The Ghost feels light and reactive, yet offers enough cushioning. The toe box is a little narrow, so I size up a half size. However, it fits true to size in all other aspects.",
120225,5,10/12/2017,Great shoes right out of the box!! I love everything about these shoes!!  I was leery of making the purchase on-line as I have bunions and many shoes that are reported to be comfortable for persons with this problem are not but the guarantee by Brooks made me decide to go ahead.  I'm glad I did.  The shoes feel great even after an 8 hour shift on my feet all day with students and they look cute as well.,
120225,5,10/12/2017,"I would buy this product again and again and I do. Ghost is my go to shoe.  I wear a 10.5, am neutral, and have a wider foot.  I try on other shoes periodically however for running and teaching Group Fitness these are my go to pair every time.",
120225,5,10/12/2017,Women's Ghost 9 Your sizing is not consistent. After wearing a size 10 in this shoe I'm ordering a 10.5 to see if it fits better. But thank you for adding a toe guard as I am a big toe lifter and wear holes where it lifts. This iteration of Ghost may fix that issue.,
120225,5,10/12/2017,yes Well supported shoe fits comfortable. And feet never get tired like some shoes. Like the comfort and feel of the shoe. They also ate a great color scheme.,
120225,5,10/12/2017,"Comfort and support I really like the cushion yet lightweight feel. It also feels stable as opposed to too squishy. My only problem was developing a blister on my right foot where the toe box was a little tighter than what I got used to with the Glycerin model. I have awkwardly shaped feet, apparently. And I ran a half marathon as my third run in the shoes. I am hoping that if I break them in a little more, it'll get better?!I love Brooks and their customer service! I'm a loyal fan.",
120225,4,10/12/2017,"Great running shoes I just bought these shoes and tried them on a treadmill for the first time. The padding on the shoes is great (I'm used to running Nike's so this is a great change). Initially the shoes felt a little tight (even though I bought half a size bigger), but it wasn't a problem at all when I started running. So far I'm really liking the shoes and I'm looking forward to trying them outdoors soon. #ReviewSweeps",
120225,4,10/11/2017,"So far I love my Ghost 9 running shoes. I do love these shoes. I did replace the insoles, but I do that on every pair of athletic shoes I own. It took one or two short runs for my feet to get comfortable in new shoes, but they have been great ever since. I really like some of the color options, but some are a bit too loud for me. Probably a good combination for whatever you like in running shoes.",

I had a couple surgeries on my foot that makes most shoes unbearable to wear for more than a couple hours. Today, I came home from work and realized I hadn't taken my shoes off all day! I don't think I've done that since before my surgery 13 years ago! I recently went up half a size after my first pregnancy and this style didn't make my feet look like the size 11.5 they are.

I then decided to go back to the old and good Ghost 9 and must say, I will never spend so much money in a pair of shoes when I can have the best one for almost half of the price. I only wore the Ghost 9 3 times before running my 1st marathon. Very very comfy. I love it.",
120225,5,10/09/2017,I would (and did) buy this shoe again! I wear these shoes for running outside and using cardio equipment (treadmill and other) at the gym.

I like that I can cross train without needing to switch shoes out.  I average purchasing a new pair about every 3 months.  They typically still look great but as active as I am I put miles on quick.  I've tried other shoes a couple of times but ALWAYS come back to Ghost.  I have no intention of using anything else.  I do feel like the materials used have changed a bit and they aren't holding up quite as well as in the past and that is why I only gave 4 stars.",

In the previous models, a whole in the mesh would form right above my big toe on both left and right shoes.

120225,5,10/03/2017,"Love your sneakers! I bought these for support because my husband's physical therapist recommended them to him and they worked great for him.  He then mentioned my symptoms and she said for me to try them also.  I loved my first pair so much, I order 2 more.",
120225,5,10/03/2017,PERFECT I've run in these 3-4 times so far - they are super supportive and comfortable. I'll definitely buy them again.,
120225,5,10/03/2017,I bought 2 more pairs!!! These shoes had the perfect arch to support my plantar fasciitis.  I bought 2 more pairs of this shoe because I loved them so much and really liked this particular color.,
120225,5,10/03/2017,"Tempted to buy several pairs to keep in the closet! The arch support is great in these shoes, wish I had found them earlier, I would have bought several. I prefer them over the Gts that I paid more for.",
120225,5,10/03/2017,Most comfy shoes ever! I wear these for all of my 12hr shifts as well as my daily walking (and I'm quite active.) I'll never buy anything else!,
120225,4,10/03/2017,"Comfortable Wide toe box for those who like that. Not that ""snug"" fit.  Comfortable enough.",
120225,3,10/03/2017,"Fit After ordering another pair 1/2 size larger-the shoe still does not fit. It feels too short, too narrow in the toe box and foot bed at the arch does not sit comfortably. I have worn Ghost model for several years and this is the first I have returned it.",
120225,4,10/03/2017,"I would probably go back to transcend This is a very good shoe, but I think I need more support and cushion. Thank you.",
120225,2,10/02/2017,Not a great fit I have had two other pairs of ghost running shoes and did not have any problem with them and am currently wearing the glycerin which I dearly love but the ghost 9 is very uncomfortable and the size that I usually wear almost feels too small. I hope that as I wear these shoes and running them or they will get more comfortable but I only wear them for a couple hours and then I put my glycerins back on due to uncomfortableness,
120225,5,10/02/2017,I only run in Brooks shoes.  Love them!!! ,
120225,4,10/02/2017,"Definitely worth trying! First time trying the ghost line. Cushioning is real good in fore foot and heel. I have plantar fasciitis, so it's very important that I find good shoes. These  delivered!",
120225,5,10/01/2017,ALWAYS BROOKS! I walk 3 miles daily and Brooks Ghost is always my favorite footwear for walking and aerobics...I like the way they fit my foot from the moment I put them on...a nice wider toe box  which I like...but it hugs my heel which is great for me!  This is probably my 6th pair of Brooks Ghost!,
120225,5,10/01/2017,"Love, love, love! I rarely give 5 stars to anything. These sneakers are super comfy and supportive. I just love them!",
120225,5,10/01/2017,"I have been purchasing this product since 2009. I use this product almost daily. I run in them, work in them (I am a nurse) and weight lift in them. They usually last me 9 months or so.",
120225,2,10/01/2017,Nothing like previous ghost models I wear a 10.5 In all my previous ghost shoes. The ghost 9 felt shorter and more narrow in the toe area. The black rubber piece on top of the toes was very uncomfortable. Tried on a ghost 10 in a store and they were great. Returned the ghost 9.,
120225,5,10/01/2017,Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I love these shoes but I just noticed this slight ripple at the side seam. I have only been riding my bike in these as I am suffering from plantar fasciitis and was told not to do any walking.,
120225,5,10/01/2017,I love these shoes! I have been suffering from Plantar Faciitis but these feel great. So glad I bought these. We told our son and he ended up buying 4 pairs they were so comfortable.,
120225,4,10/01/2017,"Love the shoe but got the wrong size I will be returning this particular size.  I followed the instructions on the Brooks websites for what size to purchase based on the brand and size of shoe I usually wear.  The Brooks shoes I purchased have ended up being too large.  Other than that, I do like the support and feel of the shoes and I'm excited to have my correct size!",
120225,4,10/01/2017,Repeat Ghost customer Definitely feels smaller than my other Ghosts...always were a comfortable fit until the 9s.,
120225,5,09/30/2017,Great Shoe! Purchased these for my daughter for Cross Country.  She loves the feel and comfort and the colors!,
120225,5,09/30/2017,❤️❤️❤️ ,
120225,5,09/30/2017,Am very pleased ,
120225,5,09/30/2017,I love this shoe I love this shoe and bought it to replace my ghost 8 shoes. I gave it 5 stars because it's very comfortable but it does feel just a tiny bit smaller than the old pair. I always buy a half size bigger. I think a whole size would be too big. (I'm a 7 so I buy a 7 1/2) Overall I love the way it feels.,
120225,5,09/29/2017,My favorite ! This is my go to shoe for working out and walking!  I haven't bought another brand since I was introduced to Brooks.,
120225,5,09/29/2017,I bought this for heel padding and its great ,
120225,2,09/29/2017,Quality of this shoe is horrible I would not recommend the quality of the shoe is very poor. I bought a pair of these and they fell apart within 3 weeks I thought maybe I had just received a bad pair and wanted to give brooks a second chance however my second pair is also now falling apart.,
120225,4,09/29/2017,Running is fun again! Love the support they provide when I have time to run. Super cute for running errands in as well!,
120225,5,09/29/2017,Best running shoe for my half marathon!!! ,
120225,5,09/27/2017,Ghost line is fabulous for me Shoe is very comfortable although it is a tad shorter than Ghost 8. Toebox is also narrower compare to Ghost 8 (again) but I am fine with it. The shoes really hug my feet well. Great buy! I run for cardio training to maintain good health. Ghost 9 fits the bill.,
120225,5,09/26/2017,"Seems like a great shoe but too big Seems like a great shoe but was too big. I ordered the size I normally wear in other brands (Asics, Mizuno) but these were a little too big, resulting in tightness at ball of my foot and too much room in toe box. Fingers crossed half size down works because I want to like these shoes! Cushioning level felt perfect.",
120225,5,09/26/2017,Excellent fit and feel ,
120225,3,09/25/2017,A little disappointed Have been using this same model shoe for the last 2 years or so and have not had this problem. No room for the big toe and uncomfortable--foot joints hurt. Hoped it just needed breaking in so used a couple of times probably cannot return since they are dirty from the trails.I would still recommend since all other aspects of the shoe are good. I would recommend to friends to try the next half size up from their regular size.,
120225,5,09/25/2017,"Great shoes Looks great, feels supportive and lasts well. I'm on my feet all day at work.",
120225,5,09/25/2017,I would & have bought this product again & again Currently training for my first marathon & loving my Ghost 9! I have run 7 half marathons & started wearing brooks after #3 and I don't plan on ever switching to another brand,
120225,2,09/25/2017,"My favorite Brooks...but not this pair! I have worn the Ghost series since the Ghost 5.  This is my 5th pair of the Ghost 9.  Love the 9 overall.  However, this pair I think is mismarked in size. They are way too short! I will be contacting customer service regarding this purchase.",
120225,2,09/25/2017,Not comfortable for me. ,
120225,4,09/24/2017,Repeat Ghost buyer Ghost 9 sizing doesn't match how shoe has fit previously with ordering same size. Tight on the top. Otherwise comfortable running shoe!,
120225,5,09/24/2017,I love this shoe ,
120225,5,09/24/2017,Love the ghost ,
120225,5,09/24/2017,I have worn Brooks Ghosts for years and love them! For running. I run a couple half marathons each year and various other shorter races so I put a lot of mileage on my shoes. These shoes always hold up well and don't break down as fast as other brands I have worn.,
120225,3,09/24/2017,Sizing ,
120225,5,09/24/2017,SO supportive! I work out with a trainer and I've had this very shoe before in a different color.  I LOVE the support I feel throughout my workout!  Don't ever stop making this shoe!,
120225,5,09/24/2017,"Love, love these shoes! ",
120225,4,09/23/2017,I've tried other running shoes and Brooks are the Best!! Probably my 6th pair and they never disappoint. One small complaint the last pair I got the shoe laces were different lengths?!?,
120225,5,09/23/2017,I would buy these for sure again. I enjoy the level of support and comfort this product provides me. I run frequently so these are my new favorites!!! ❤️❤️❤️,
120225,3,09/23/2017,I would probably not buy this shoe again ,
120225,5,09/23/2017,"I'm a believer!! The Ghost 9 feels great!! I was sceptical...tried the Ghost 6 and was was not impressed. However, the re-engineering on the 9 is amazing!! Great balance of comfort, performance, and style!!",
120225,5,09/23/2017,Best running shoes ever! ,
120225,5,09/23/2017,"They just keep getting better! I switched to Brooks around the time the Ghost 7 came out and I've never looked back. Each generation seems to improve on the previous one.I like that the tongue of the shoe is more substantial now - it fixes the issue I've had with previous models where it folds up and presses against the top of the foot.  The fabric around the opening is more durable as well, so it doesn't shred like the others did. I run about 3-4 days a week, and I was able to switch to these right away without any break in time.  I hope the Ghost always stays this comfortable - it's like running on clouds!",
120225,3,09/22/2017,"Well made shoes, but they aren't right for me There is minimal flexibility in these shoes. My feet hurt weather I wear them to work or to jog. I really wanted to love these shoes, but I just can't.",
120225,5,09/22/2017,"These are awesome! After running in Nikes for the past few years, I was ready for a change. I absolutely love these shoes! They blow my Nike running shoes out of the water as far as comfortability goes, and they do not feel too heavy while I am running. Will never run in another shoe other than a Brooks!",
120225,5,09/22/2017,Love love love these shoes!  It's all I wear. ,
120225,5,09/22/2017,"Love my Ghost 9!!!! I upgraded from Ghost 7 to Ghost 9 and I am loving it!!! I am a big Brooks fan, and this one met all my expectations!!!!",
120225,5,09/22/2017,I would definitely buy these again! ,
120225,4,09/22/2017,I'll always buy brooks! ,
120225,5,09/22/2017,"Brooks Forever I suffered from plantar fasciitis for a long time. I tried everything, including steroid injections. Then I bought a pair of Brooks Ghost 5. My plantar fasciitis disappeared and hasn't bothered me for 3 years!! I finally broke down and purchased the Ghost 9 so I could wear them to work and allow my Ghost 5's just for exercising. I am never disappointed with this line. The doctor I work for only wears this line too!  I will never go back to any other brand.",
120225,5,09/21/2017,Loved them ,
120225,2,09/21/2017,"Upper Leather Toe, not right for me ",
120225,5,09/20/2017,"This is the second pair we bought We only wish there were replacement insoles available. The shoe wears extremely well, but the insoles get flat before too long.",
120225,2,09/20/2017,"Poor fit, runs narrow With thin socks the shoe fits well enough for short runs, but the toe box feels cramped after foot swell on longer runs.  The tongue attachment area on the left shoe rubbed quite badly and gave me a blister.  The toe cap also compressed and pinched the toe when I wore thick socks.  A half a size up would allow for thicker socks in cold weather but there would be too much slide on downhills, and potentially heel slip.  I had a pair of Brooks Pure Cadence which I loved, so the Ghost 9 was a disappointment.  Sending them back. :(",
120225,3,09/20/2017,"okay with some modification This shoe is very bulky. If you like a show with more support and cushion it might be for you but it's not my favorite. I had to replace the laces as the one's that came with the shoes where elastic. When I tried to lace them up tight enough, the shoe laces became way too long. Even with new regular laces, it's difficult to get them laced properly where my foot won't slide around side to side. I don't have narrow feet and have always bought standard width or wider shoes. I'm not sure if the shoe is actually too wide or just the design is overbuilt.",
120225,5,09/20/2017,Comfy from first wear I don't like when it takes a while to break shoes in. When I get them I want them to be comfy from day one and these fit the bill!,
120225,5,09/20/2017,"Yes Yes Yes Having  had plantar fasciitis  for 5 months, my feet are priority.  The Ghost 9 felt so good on my feet . I loved them so much ,I ordered  another pair.",
120225,5,09/20/2017,great light weight comfortable shoe I wear these shoes to workout and for long walking. Very light shoe and very comfortable. I normally walk 10-15000 steps per day. Great for everyday wear also. Love Brooks!,
120225,4,09/20/2017,Great Shoe This is my 3rd pair of Ghost 9 - definitely like the shoe and enjoy running and walking in this shoe.  I have knee issue and this shoe has made a difference in my ability to continue running/walking.,
120225,5,09/19/2017,Love I am breaking these shoes in for my marathon in a few weeks. I went on a 16 mile run and couldn't believe how much more comfortable these shoes were compared to the asics i was running with. Definitely recommend!,
120225,5,09/19/2017,Superb Quality Always always love the Brooks Ghost! They never disappoint! The most comfortably supported shoe I have ever worn. Like running on clouds!,
120225,4,09/19/2017,"Not right for me I underpronate and have shin splints and the way my foot fell in these aggravated by shin pain. I first wore them on a 2 mile walk and by the end knew it would be reckless for me to use these for running. I just don't think they were the right shoe for me, but I ended up giving them to my mom who does not run but goes on regular long walks and she absolutely loves them.  They are super stable for her and she really likes the generous toe box and arch support. To me, these felt stiff especially around the opening and not as cushioned as my previous pairs of Brooks. I think they are a good non-specialized shoe and if you can grab them while they are on sale, it's worth a try to see if they work for you.",
120225,3,09/19/2017,"Nice shoes but not enough cushioning for me These are very nice and comfortable right out of the box. However, I just don't find them as cushion-y and supportive as other brands I've worn. I ran in them 3 times and just wasn't impressed. I'm tall with an athletic frame, and I come down hard on my feet, so I just need a more supportive shoe I guess. I will probably have to return these and I'm disappointed.",
120225,5,09/19/2017,AMAZING ,
120225,4,09/19/2017,Love this shoe but.. ,
120225,5,09/19/2017,"Love These Shoes I love these shoes because they are so comfortable.  I have this pair and one other Brooks Ghost and these are the only shoes that I could put on and walk the distance the first time I put them on.  I didn't have to ""break them in"".",
120225,5,09/19/2017,I buy these year after year; my go to shoe ,
120225,2,09/19/2017,New toe design very uncomfortable for me. Will return. Thought it was safe to just order the same shoe style. Sad to say new toe design has hurt the top of my foot running. Will return.,
120225,5,09/18/2017,"Replaced Ghost 9 I don't run, but walk and do aerobics every day, and stand on concrete 8 hours a day for work.  I like the support I get from this shoe, both when walking and working.  These are a replacement for my Ghost 8s, and I'm as happy with these as I was with those.",
120225,4,09/18/2017,Run smaller than size ordered! ,
120225,4,09/16/2017,"If the price is right, I would buy this again. I purchased the Ghost 10 too.  I feel like the 10 has more cushion to it.  I like them both, the 9 & 10, but I prefer the 10.  I wear the 10 more for my walking on uneven terrain.",
120225,5,09/16/2017,"This is my third pair of Ghost 9 They are great! This is my third pair and I will keep buying them until they are no longer available. I have had no issues, no injuries.  Good quality shoes.",
120225,1,09/16/2017,"Returning because fit is not same as other pair I have I have the exact same style in The gray/teal color and I absolutely love them! Unfortunately, when I purchased the exact same size, same style, in the black/purple/teal color from Brooks online, the tip of toe box pushed down too hard on my big toe with both shoes. This is not an issue at all with the gray/teal version I bought. They actually fit like two entirely different shoes, and it was a huge disappointment. I went and tried the same black/purple/teal shoes that I had ordered online and returned in the a running store, and the same issue occurred with the toe box being too snug/tight on my big toe. Bizarre to me as to how two of the same style shoes can fit so drastically different!",
120225,5,09/16/2017,Love My Brooks Ghost 9 ,
120225,5,09/15/2017,"Happy and very satisfied with Ghost 9 I have been running for many years, I have trained for 4 half-marathons and in each of them I have trusted Brooks running shoes to get me through my training sessions and race day. I have recently purchased the Ghost 9 running shoes and I can say that they are the best pair I have owned yet. They are very very comfortable and breathable. These are some of the most important things I look for when purchasing new running shoes. I am very happy with how these shoes fit, as well as the arch support that is provided in them. I typically wear a 9.5 in most shoes that I wear, so I stick with the 9.5 in my running shoes as well. I have tried to go with the next size up (10) and I have struggled to find comfort. They seem to slip a little more than I would like. Which makes me get blisters on my heals and toes. The cushioning inside of the Ghost 9 is much better than the previous pairs I have owned. I am very pleased with how my feet feel after running 3 miles or 13 miles. I have heard some of my friends complain that they feel heavy on their feet on long runs, but I have not experienced that. Generally, I feel like they are very lightweight on my feet. I wear them to the park, grocery store, and to activities. I am very happy with how these shoes have held up. I have worn them in the rain and mud, but they have always bounced back. They do not lose their comfort even after they get wet. I am honestly very happy with the Ghost 9 running shoes that I have purchased. I will definitely be purchasing another pair when these ones wear out. I can typically wear a pair of running shoes for 3-4 months during my training sessions and then once I have completed the race, I use them for daily activities other than just running. I have recommended these shoes already to many of my close family members that need a comfortable pair of shoes to get through their work day. My mom has definitely fell in love with how these shoes make her feet feel.",
120225,5,09/15/2017,"Ghost 9 ~ Another Running Winner! This will be my fourth pair of Brooks, and I do believe that I will always have a pair of Brooks in my closet.  Last pair were the Glycerin 13's, which I loved.  Bought the Glycerin 14's and had to return them as the upgrade did not do it justice and they were really uncomfortable. I spoke with a Customer Service Rep who was wonderful and suggested two other styles. Bought both styles, one of which is the Ghost 9. My feet are happy once again ... and so am I!  Thank you!!",
120225,5,09/15/2017,Comfort and support I walk every day and these shoes are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  Cushioning is great on city streets and walkways.,
120225,5,09/14/2017,Gorgeous and comfy! Colors are exactly what I was looking for (Silver/Blue Atoll/Lime Punch) and they're extremely comfortable on my arthritic toes. Best sneakers ever!,
120225,3,09/14/2017,I would buy these shoes again. They are very comfortable except the part that rubs against my Achilles; it seems higher up the Achilles than my other Ghost shoes.,
120225,3,09/14/2017,"May not buy this style in the future. Very light weight. The toe box is uncomfortably tight. Hoping they will ""give"" a bit as the length is good. Never have had this problem with any of the other Brooks styles. To be determined on how the soles wear as they seems so very light. Walk a dog on average 4 hrs a day.",
120225,5,09/13/2017,"This shoe is my choice again and again I have a very difficult foot due to previous injury. The Ghost series shoe is so supportive and well made, I buy it over and over.",
120225,5,09/13/2017,"Great fit and feel. I wear these shoes when I walk my dog, and as the weather cools I will wear them most of the time.  I like the fit, color, and how my feet feel.  I struggle with feet pain but these shoes work well to allow me to walk and not hurt.",
120225,1,09/13/2017,I would not buy the Ghost 9 I last 5 pairs of Brooks running shoes have been great. The Ghost 9 is the only shoe that the Sole ripped on me.,
120225,5,09/12/2017,i love & would buy again!!!!! ,
120225,5,09/12/2017,Great shoes! These are my third pair and I would keep buying ,
120225,5,09/12/2017,My favorite Ghost shoe yet! ,
120225,5,09/12/2017,"I have bought this. I work in Food Service  on concrete floors.  HIGHLY RECCOMEND  these shoes.  Been buying this style since Ghost 5. Made a mistake and tried a different stlye once, only wore 4 days caused lots of back and knee pain.  GHOST  is now the only STYLE i will buy.  Great shoes for anyone spending lots of time on feet.",
120225,4,09/11/2017,Yes I would purchas again ,
120225,1,09/10/2017,No I switched from pureflow to ghost and I do not like the fit. There is a toe guard which runs my big toe. In process of returning for the pureflow,
120225,5,09/10/2017,❤️ my favorite ,
120225,5,09/09/2017,"I love them., I wear them for work, on my feet all day. ",
120225,3,09/09/2017,I am not sure buying this shoes again I am still not sure about this shoes my hip started to hurt on third run . I needed returned shoes,
120225,5,09/09/2017,I have bought this product three times!! I wear my Brooks to work. I am a critical care nurse in a level one trauma center. These shoes are indispensable!,
120225,5,09/08/2017,Recommended I walk 5 miles a day on concrete at my job.  These shoes offer the support and cushion I need to get through my day.,
120225,5,09/08/2017,Obsessed. I had been looking for a shoe with better support - and I found it! These are by far the best running shoes I've ever owned.  Will only be buying Brooks from now on! These shoes make me look forward to those weekend long runs.,
120225,4,09/08/2017,"Love these Bought these for walking on vacation.  Ran into another woman wearing the same shoe - she loves because it comes in narrow and I love because it comes in wide.  It is a lightweight shoe, not overly supportive, so I wouldn't recommend for serious hiking, but for touring museums, shopping, they're perfect.",
120225,5,09/08/2017,"Yes Love this ghost 9. Switched to Brooks Ghost on version 6, and can't run in anything else since!!",
120225,5,09/07/2017,"My Tried and True Running Shoe I have been running for 4 years, and Brooks Ghost 9 is the only shoe I have ever trained in. They are lightweight, but durable; stylish, but serve their true purpose.I do order mine a half size larger than what I typically wear (10.5 instead of 10), so my suggestion is to try them on in a running store, so you can be fitted properly. Happy Running!",
120225,5,09/06/2017,Great!!!! So comfortable! ,
120225,5,09/06/2017,"Great for Narrow Feet I was looking to replace my beloved Ghost 7s and checked out the Brooks site for likely candidates. Decided to actually buy from the site because of the generous shipping/return policy. And having so many colors available was great. I'm a walker, not a runner, with narrow feet and the new shoes fit perfectly and were extremely comfortable right from the start. Took them out for an inaugural 6 mile walk the first day and forgot I even had on new shoes.",
120225,5,09/05/2017,Great shoe. ,
120225,5,09/05/2017,I bought 2 😊 ,
120225,5,09/04/2017,Love these! I love these sneakers.  I have changed sneakers pretty often and stopped looking after wearing these.  They are comfortable with enough support and stability that balance each other.,
120225,5,09/04/2017,Ghost 9 ,
120225,5,09/02/2017,Very comfortable I'm and OR nurse and these are comfortable for long work days in my feet. Good support and cushioning,
120225,3,09/01/2017,"Had to return The material in the heel is slick.  My heels were sliding quite a bit while running and even while walking.  I'm usually a medium width, but I feel a this shoe is wider than the typical medium width shoe.  The cushion is great and colors are true to picture.",
120225,4,09/01/2017,"Very comfortable, stylish and good all around shoe feels just a bit narrow through the toe area - the top of the shoe where the rubber comes over tends to press down on the big toe causing soreness to the toe.  Other than that one minor flaw (may just be this pair) these are great shoes",
120225,5,08/31/2017,Love this shoe! This is my second pair of Ghosts and I love them even more than the first pair!,
120225,5,08/31/2017,Best shoes I've ever owned. ,
120225,5,08/30/2017,The perfect sneakers for my feet 😄 ,
120225,5,08/29/2017,"Great shoes, highly recommend! ",
120225,4,08/29/2017,I would buy these again I am a xc coach and I use these shoes and I now have 3 other kids using them as well . Great road shoe,
120225,5,08/28/2017,"First pair of Brooks & very impressed! This was my first pair of Brooks and I have been running for about 7 years now. I have always been a Nike girl, but when a friend recommended I try these and with the sale that was going on I had to take advantage! From my first run I never felt like I had to ""break in"" these shoes, they have been comfortable from the start and no blisters which tends to happen a lot with new shoes. I am a 7 1/2 in women's and normal width and they are very true to size for me. I was worried about them being a little too bulky, but they are not at all- they are on the ""heavier"" side compared to some of these newer running shoes that are so lightweight. But I was very happy to see that they are just a normal shoe and the weight helps feel like the shoe is more supportive while running. Overall, great purchase and I will definitely be purchasing more Brooks in the future!",
120225,5,08/28/2017,Great shoe! I bought the Ghost 9 when they first came out and I am now on my third pair. I love this shoe. It fits perfectly and provides the right amount of cushion and spring. I hope they continue this one for a while-it's perfect for me.,
120225,5,08/28/2017,Great shoes for Half Marathons! ,
120225,4,08/27/2017,Love these! I have been wearing Brooks Adrenaline for 6 years! However the last pair I purchased were not the same so I made the switch to the Ghost after giving them a try at a local running store.  These are wonderful! So much more cushion than the Adrenalines and very comfortable yet supportive! Will definitely purchased again.,
120225,5,08/27/2017,"Love them! Would buy them again. I run 5k, 10k and 13.1 in these shoes. Very comfortable for all the distances.",
120225,4,08/26/2017,"Love Ghost! I love Brooks Ghost shoes. I really liked Ghost 7 and 8.   I can tell a slight change with Ghost 9 from previous 7 & 8.  I can live with Ghost 9. I also tried the Glycerin 15, but sticking to Ghost 9.  I recommend Brooks to anyone who asks, just find the shoe type for yourself.",
120225,4,08/26/2017,Just the shoe I was looking for! ,
120225,5,08/25/2017,Great Buy Product was true to size and width.  I've run in them several times (short distances 3 miles or less) I am looking forward to running in them for longer distances.,
120225,5,08/25/2017,"Great shoe, doesn't hurt my bunions I have bad bunions on both feet and run everyday.  This is the first pair of sneakers that do not rub or put pressure on my bunions.  It took me a long time to find a pair of sneakers that were this comfortable.  If they change the design and add more trimming around the side, I will cry.  It is my third pair of the blue/grey color.  I run a lot, so I have to buy new sneakers every 3-6 months before my knees hurt when running (this is for all sneakers I've ever owned).  Once I retire them from running, I use them for aerobics, hiking and golf.",
120225,5,08/25/2017,"Running on clouds After seeing the good reviews for the Ghost 9, (and they were on sale) I bought these to try out for distance running.  I've used the Pure Cadence for a couple of years now but am training for longer distances and I felt they weren't cushiony enough.  The first time I ran in the Ghosts, I fell in love with how amazing they felt!  They have good support, lightweight, fit perfectly and are very cushiony like running on clouds.  I'll definitely be buying more.",
120225,2,08/24/2017,"Won't buy Brook's Had to return the shoes as they run very small.  Didn't seem to have as much cushion as I expected based on other reviews.  Will not buying Brook's again, as I am still waiting for my refund!!!",
120225,5,08/24/2017,"Great shoe I average 20-30 miles a week and alternate between these and the Ghost 10.  I love them both, great, soft and comfortable running shoe.",
120225,5,08/23/2017,Love my Ghosts! ,
120225,1,08/23/2017,"I won't buy this product online again. I have been wearing the Ghost for about five years now.  I wear them mostly for work as I am on my feet all day long.  I have worn a size 9.5 ever since I have started wearing these shoes, so I ordered a 9.5.  They are too short.  My feet didn't change that much.  It has to be the shoes.  Disappointed to say the least.",
120225,5,08/22/2017,"Hands down, Best running shoes! These are the second pair of Ghost 9' I've purchased in the last 2 years. I gave my old pair to my daughter, and she loves them. Perfect support and shock absorption. I'll never wear anything different.",
120225,4,08/21/2017,Fantastic shoes! ,
120225,5,08/21/2017,"Yes, I would buy this shoe again. This is the second pair I have worn and I like them.  I am retired and these have become my ""everyday"" shoes.  My first pair lasted 2 years so they are worth the money.  I love the color choices as well.  It was the first time I ordered them on line but that was easy and painless as well.  Overall I am happy with the sneakers and the whole ordering process.",
120225,5,08/21/2017,Love love love these days ,
120225,5,08/21/2017,Love ghost ,
120225,3,08/20/2017,I love my ghost but not this time 😓😓 ,
120225,4,08/20/2017,"Not good for stability I did the shoe finder and this shoe was recommended. I usually wear the adrenaline as I overpronate, but the shoe finder doesnt ask that anymore. I found this shoe to have a ton of support in the heel but the front of my foot felt like it was hitting the pavement and turning in too much.",
120225,5,08/19/2017,New to brooks ,
120225,5,08/19/2017,I love these ,
120225,5,08/19/2017,"I would buy this product again and again I am an avid Runner usually only logging 15-20 miles/week, unless I'm training. I've done a couple half marathons and I really think that these shoes would be perfect for that!",
120225,3,08/18/2017,"most comfortable pair of Brooks sneakers, toe room problem I loved how comfortable this sneaker felt; unfortunately, my toes didn't have enough room.  I have always worn Brooks size 8.5, but my toes came right up against the tip of the sneaker.  I ended up going to Medved and purchased a pair of Brooks Ghost 10, size 8.5.",
120225,5,08/17/2017,Running Happy! ,
120225,5,08/16/2017,"This is my fourth pair of Ghost, lasting 450-500 miles. ",
120225,5,08/16/2017,"I have 9 pairs of ghosts I have 9 pairs of ghosts and each new version gets progressively better. I've tried running in different brands but brooks ghost is best for me. I'm not positive how durable this shoe will be, a couple versions back the durability wasn't good but it was such a good shoe I didn't mind too much.",
120225,5,08/16/2017,"Best shoe. Hands down. Being a serious under-pronator, I really struggled to find something that I could wear daily and wouldn't wear out in a month. It's vital you take the fit test that Brooks offers to know which style is best. Otherwise, you're going to basically get a false sense of this brand. I highly recommend brooks to everyone and I've never had anyone complain after taking my advice.",
120225,4,08/15/2017,Nice shoe I like the shoes. They are comfortable and yet supportive.  I think they run a little small but I like the roomy toe bed so my toes can stretch out and the color is great. I think a 9 would have been too big.,
120225,3,08/15/2017,"Disappointed in durability I've had these for less than a month and the sole is already coming off, with under 20 miles of running",
120225,5,08/15/2017,"I wish the Ghost10 fit this good I initially bought the new Ghost 10 and unfortunately it was not as comfortable and more flimsy than the 9, so I tried to stock up on the remaining 9s",
120225,5,08/14/2017,Love this sneaker ,
120225,5,08/12/2017,"Will keep running with Brooks! Was recommended to try Brooks for running 3 years ago, and I love them. Very comfortable, and cushioned. I switch between the Glycerin and the Ghost.",
120225,5,08/12/2017,"Ghost is my favorite!! The first time I tried the Ghost shoe was the Ghost 7, they were perfect for me. I was a huge fan of the Ghost 8 and IN LOVE with the 9!!  So much heel cushion!   I have purchased 4 pair so far and I'm probably not done. I was wearing the Ravenna (which was recommended from my local running store) previously and was having IT Band issues. So, I thought I would try a more neutral shoe. The Ghost made a world of difference, I rarely ever run in any of my other styles of shoes. They are perfect for outdoor and treadmill running. I'm currently training for the Chicago Marathon and these will be my race day shoe!  If you're looking for a neutral, well cushioned running shoe, give he Ghost a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed!",
120225,5,08/11/2017,Very comfortable! ,
120225,5,08/11/2017,This is my go to purchase for running shoes! Love this shoe. I buy so often that I wish more color choices were available more often!,
120225,5,08/09/2017,Able to run in right out of box I rotate my shoes between Ghost and Ravenna's. I purchased the ghost off of the clearance section and was able to run in them right out of the box. These shoes feel great! I would recommend.,
120225,2,08/08/2017,Disappointed I stand /walk 12 hour shifts. Have always loved my brooks ghost but this pair was uncomfortable out of the box and remains that way.  Stiff with no cushion,
120225,3,08/08/2017,"issues with the front rubber peeling I love the color in the Purple. I normally am very plain with my running sneakers. I tried the Purple ones. They are comfortable running in them and running my errands. I get compliments on the color.The main issue I have had the the front black rubber on the shoe started to peel, after wearing them maybe (3) times. I have even bought from a different source and had the same issue. BUT I love the shoe.. Is anyone else having this issue?? i want to buy them again but a TAD nervous that it will happen again..  Besides that issue really love the shoe...",
120225,5,08/06/2017,I would definitely buy this shoe again! The cushion is excellent. Toe box is great. No slippage in the heel. Plenty of room for that long second toe!,
120225,5,08/05/2017,"Love These Shoes I always wear a size 9 running shoe and ordered a 9. Just the slightest big big in the toe, but doesn't affect my running. Very comfortable!",
120225,5,08/05/2017,Love my Brooks. Have to go 1/2 size up for fit ,
120225,5,08/03/2017,"This is my Go-To reorder shoe for running! I have tried many different shoes for running. I always come back to this! I would love more color and design options, but fit and comfort first!",
120225,5,08/02/2017,Named Ghost for a reason I truly feel like I'm floating above the ground in these shoes . So comfortable. Great for long trail walks and for runs.,
120225,5,08/01/2017,Make my feet happy!!! I walk every night and have a problem foot that has swelled for years for no reason.  These are very comfortable and give cushion exactly where I needed it.  I cannot wait to buy another pair.,
120225,5,08/01/2017,I will always buy Brooks I have to stick to what I know works for me.  I've tired other brands because there on sale but it never works for me.  It has to be Brooks.,
120225,5,08/01/2017,"Ghost story Been running in these for years. Have tried other brands on for a spin to see and feel what's new, but always come back to my Ghost!",
120225,5,08/01/2017,"Great shoe! I have put almost 100 miles on these shoes in just over a couple weeks.  They have great cushioning, are light weight, and comfortable true to Ghost form.  I do buy Brooks shoes up a half size from my normal shoes.",
120225,5,07/29/2017,I Love this shoe ❤️ Just started training for a half marathon that takes place in November. These shoes have made all the difference.,
120225,5,07/29/2017,This is my 5th pair of ghost shoes. I have never like tennis shoes until I found these. I am 61 and wear them everyday I am so excited every year to get a new pair. Thank you so much for a wonderful pair of tennis shoes. You better never stop making them. Lol,
120225,5,07/28/2017,Great shoes.  Hugs your feet and feels good. ,
120225,3,07/27/2017,"My new Brooks Ghost shoes:  New heel design so disapointing I LOVE Brooks Ghost shoes and recently purchased directly  from you Ghost 9.  But I am so disappointed to find out that the heel does not have the contoured ""dip"" in the back, as all the others, and digs right into my straight, achilles tendon!   I will have to return it, and I see all your Brooks Ghosts (10) are the same way.   What do you advise?  I hope you will change the heel back to the way it has been for years.  I am so disappointed to have to give up Brooks Ghosts for running!",
120225,5,07/26/2017,Love the Ghost! I have been running in the Ghost model for years! Comfy shoe without feeling too bulky!,
120225,5,07/26/2017,"Great Shoe! I love Brooks! I have 2 pair of these Brooks Ghost 9. They are comfortable right out of the box, and very soft. I used to wear the Glycerin, but they get holes in the mesh on the top very easily, so I switched to these. I wish there were more color choices in the Ghost shoe (like the Adrenaline and Launch).",
120225,3,07/26/2017,"Not the shoes for me Ive always wanted to try Brooks shoes but never got the chance until recently when I was searching for a new pair of running shoes. Its always a hassle because I have to be mindful that past bad shoe choices contributed to shin splints and other nasty injuries. This shoes seems to be too ""clunky"" for my liking. I gave it a try based on reviews and after a few minutes of trying them on my feet started aching. I tried loosening the laces but to no avail. Either the arches in this shoe do not match with my feet, or it was just too structured for my liking. They felt a little heavy on my feet as well. Nice shoe, just not right for my complicated feet! Shipping was timely and service was great.",
120225,5,07/26/2017,I've bought this shoe four times now! I especially love it when I can catch them on sale! I do wish it were offered in more colors for my wide width.,
120225,5,07/26/2017,Awesome discovery in athletic footwear I love these shoes!  I've been searching for an athletic shoe that has a decent arch support and these fit the bill.  Brooks are my go to shoe for athletics.,
120225,1,07/25/2017,"Not a fan of this one I have purchased Ghost running shoes for the past 23 years and the quality of the mesh has decreased. They don't wear well, mesh tears, or wears through making holes in the shoes after the first year. I wear ghost to work and I wear them to the gym, My work ghost shoes are only for work, my gym shoes are strictly for the gym. My ghost 5 and 6 are still going strong as far as the mesh on the shoes. I still wear them and love them. The ghost 9 shoes were returned, first time in 23 years of wearing ghost. They felt short and narrow compared to all my others. When I returned them, I spoke to customer service and was told that was the most popular shoe and it won awards. All I have to say is the people judging the shoes have no history with ghost and maybe they usually get their shoes from a big box store, so of course the new ghost by those standards is better. Sorry Brooks, I've recommended your shoes for years. I'm not able to do that anymore unless the ghost 10 blows me away.  We will see!",
120225,5,07/24/2017,Awesome Road/Trail Shoe ,
120225,4,07/24/2017,Love my ghosts ,
120225,5,07/24/2017,I love this shoe! This is a great neutral shoe. I use to wear the adrenalines and then after having kids my body changed. I was having knee pain and tried the Ghost and my knee pain was gone in less than a week. I have had no pains since I have been running in them. They are light and very comfortable.,
120225,5,07/24/2017,Would buy again. ,
120225,5,07/23/2017,Great shoe Brooks fit me small so I buy 1/2 size big and they fit perfectly.  These are very comfortably shoes with plenty of cushion and support.  Love them!,
120225,4,07/23/2017,"Good Shoe The shoe fits well and gives great support. I just don't like the look so much, especially the solid part over the toes.",
120225,5,07/23/2017,"Great wear! This is my 5th pair of this model, wear like iron, fit like a glove instantly, great shock absorption, neutral shoe but very supportive of my feet. Can't beat them! Won't buy anything but Brooks Ghost!",
120225,5,07/22/2017,"Best ghost yet! I've been running in ghosts since 6 and the 9 is by far the best yet! It is the most comfy and gives me the best ankle support, one of the main reasons I started wearing ghost. I always wait until the newest model is launched and then I buy the one before and save $30. They might not be the latest model but they're new to me! 😁",
120225,5,07/22/2017,I would buy this product again and again These pair of shoes are great.  I love the colors and get comments about the shoes.  I use them for cardio/weights and workout.  These are my second pair and I love them.  I order new shoes every 6 months and bought these on sale!!  Great pair of shoes:)),
120225,5,07/22/2017,This is my 3rd pair of Ghost 9 and I would buy them again. ,
120225,5,07/22/2017,I love my Brooks These are my second pair and I love them!!!I get so many compliments on the style and color!!! Please don't very stop making this pair!!!,
120225,5,07/21/2017,Love the Ghost! I have had several pairs of the Ghost. I began running with the 7 and loved them.  Then got the 8 and really was not as happy with them but still a great running shoe for me.  Then came the 9 and I think it is even better than the 7.  Thank you for keeping me moving!,
120225,5,07/21/2017,"Loving this shoe!!! I love these shoes for my daily runs. (3-5 miles right now) I'm new to this brand and I had to Oder a have size bigger than I usually wear. Nice wide toe box. Great cushion, important because I'm 6' tall and a heavy runner. Zero brake in time required. Love these shoes! I got the hot pink with black heel trim very pretty design. Overall two thumbs up! 👍🏻 👍🏻",
120225,5,07/21/2017,I love the reinforced toe. ,
120225,5,07/21/2017,I would buy this style again! ,
120225,5,07/21/2017,"THE GHOST IS ALWAYS SUBLIME! The ghost is my old standby. It is supportive, responsive, and wonderful for a wide foot. I get the 8 1/2 wide. My only wish is that they made all colors in wide. I always have to wear the grandmother colors because I have a wide foot. Small girl with a wide foot. Love, love, love the ghost; always have, always will.",
120225,5,07/20/2017,"I definitely would buy this shoe again. For years I was an avid runner and have worn the Ghost and its predecessor, the Radius, as my favorite shoe.  I can no longer run, but walk between 28 and 35 miles per week.  I prefer to wear a running shoe and have found that the Ghost still meets my needs just as well for walking as it did when I ran.  What I like about the Ghost is its flexibility in the forefoot while being stable in the heel.  I will continue to buy the Ghost as long as Brooks maintains the integrity of this model.",
120225,5,07/20/2017,"My favorite shoe of all time! The fit and comfort of the Ghost are the best! As a long time marathon runner, I've trained and raced in this running shoe for many years. Now, as a walker, I continue to find the Ghost an excellent walking shoe!",
120225,5,07/20/2017,great shoe I use these shoes for OTF. I pound my feet when I run and these shoes provide great cushion. They also have good grip for jumping and such on the floor. Really like the fit of the shoe,
120225,4,07/14/2017,"These shoes make me happy to be a runner! My favorite run shoe had been Ghost 6. Ghost 7 didn't work for me. So I've been running in Glycerin ever since, which I also like.My sisters gave me Ghost 9 on my birthday last week. I actually wore them straight out of the box for a 1/2 marathon and my feet felt great! I definitely plan to get another pair while they're still available. I gave them four stars because I've only had them a week, not sure yet how they'll hold up over time. So far I'm  very happy and expect to get many miles on these great shoes!",
120225,4,07/13/2017,"Perfect for a 12 hour shift Love my second pair of Ghost shoes, they are soft, comfortable and supportive and perfect for a 12 hour shift.",
120225,5,07/13/2017,Quality shoe ,
120225,5,07/13/2017,Awesome! Love the ghost 9s! I have worn Brooks ghost for years and the 9s are just as great as the other ones. Would recommend.,
120225,5,07/13/2017,"Love everything about this runner!!! I love the look, comfort and support of this shoe on every run & actually look forward to putting them on for the next one!!!",
120225,5,07/13/2017,"Love my Ghost 9 shoes! I do a little running but I use them for walking mostly.  I walk approx. 3 miles, twice a day.  These shoes feel very good on my feet.",
120225,1,07/13/2017,Love brooks Very disappointed in trying to order a 10 or 10.5 wide in any brook shoe. You do not give women with a wide foot much choice and no store even offer a wide. I have orthotics so I have to have a wide width. I love brooks but I will have to fine another brand to walk in.,
120225,5,07/11/2017,"Great shoes but really need to change up the colors. Really love Brooks Ghost shoes, have been wearing them for many years. I  feel like they need to change their color line or at least one pair thats tamer in color. Im sure its more adults that buy the shoes instead of  young young girls,  Beside that love the way they fit and  wear.",
120225,5,07/10/2017,Reliable and Comfortable This is my 4th Ghost in 4 years. I started with Ghost 6 and was really happy with it. My Ghost has always been the shoes to wear except for special occasions. This year's Ghost 9 didn't disappoint either. Looking forward to more Ghosts in the future!,
120225,5,07/10/2017,Great! Happier with this model than the first ones that I bought from Brooks.  Great shoe!,
120225,4,07/10/2017,"Ghost 7, very comfortable. Are they washable? ",
120225,5,07/10/2017,Awesome sneaker!!!! I run and walk in these sneakers. Trails and on the road. They are very comfortable and support my feet the best out of any sneakers I've wirn in the past! Love love love them Will continue to purchase Brooks products!,
120225,5,07/09/2017,The only shoe that works for me:-) They're my favorites. I've run 12 marathons from 49 -56yrs old and started with the Ghost 4 and love them.  They are the only shoe that works for me:-),
120225,1,07/09/2017,I would not buy the Ghost 9 again ,
120225,3,07/07/2017,"Meh, not great, not terrible. I had to return and get a half size smaller than my Ghost 7 I had been wearing. These aren't as comfortable as the Ghost 7 either. Although, I didn't get to put very many miles on them because I got a stress fracture.",
120225,5,07/07/2017,"Love these shoes! I have ran in these shoes for a cross country season, two half marathons, and a track season and still love them. Ghost 9s are the best shoes I've ever worn. My feet are very sensitive because of bunions so most shoes are uncomfortable to run in, but these have been great!",
120225,3,07/05/2017,"Why are Brooks making their shoes smaller? I use my Brooks to run and work out in.  They have seemed to have gotten smaller in width and length.  I used to be an 11 in running shoes and now I'm an 11 and 1/2; I'm also a regular width and now I'm considering a larger width.  They still give me the same sturdy support, but I wish they would stay true to their sizes.",
120225,4,07/04/2017,Toe box more narrow than Ghost 8 I'm comparing this shoe to the Ghost 8. The 9 is noticeably lighter! The toe box seems more narrow than the 8.,
120225,5,07/03/2017,Love them My 1st pair of Brooks and Ghost 9 were so comfortable. After 10 minutes of purchasing them I couldn't wait to try them . Took a 5 and half mile walk and not  one blister ! So happy,
120225,5,07/03/2017,Best running shoe ever! The cushion on this running shoe is just right. My feet get very sore if my shoes don't have proper support when I run. My feet are very happy right now!,
120225,5,07/03/2017,"My favorite running shoe! Perfect fit and ride! Lightweight, perfect amount of cushion - not too spongy and I appreciate the fit of the tongue--doesn't slip.  I have the Ghost in Gortex for wet runs as well.  If you have a stable, neutral gait, the Ghost is THE shoe!",
120225,4,07/03/2017,Great shoe Super lightweight. Only downfall is I ordered a 6.5 for extra room and they fit like a size 6,
120225,4,07/03/2017,Feel great Ghost 9 replaced my Ghost 8. I immediately noticed that Ghost 9 felt less comfortable over my big toe. I decided to try them on a run.I loved the cushion and lightweight feel.,
120225,5,07/02/2017,"Like a fine wine, gets better with age The more miles I put on these shoes, the more comfortable they become. Using these shoes to train for a half-marathon: they're great for long runs and short easy runs, yet responsive enough to throw in some faster paces. I've been dealing with some mild plantar fasciitis, and these shoes have helped keep it at bay.",
120225,1,07/02/2017,Very disappointed Already tearing up on bottom. Bottom piece already coming. Off and only had 2weeks or less,
120225,4,07/02/2017,I would probably buy another pair I walk not run but I have noticed that they are slick on the bottom when wet. I'm no spring chicken and I have to pay attention so I will not fall.,
120225,5,07/02/2017,I love the ghost 9! This model seems even a bit cushier but still stable enough for an occasional trail run.  I've been running in the ghost forever and this model is the same consistent shoe I have come to expect.,
120225,5,07/02/2017,"Goodbye Asics! I was an Asics fan for a long time until I tried the Ghost 9 today and was sold on comfort, stability and true to size fit!",
120225,5,07/01/2017,I've been wearing Brooks for several years. Great shoe ,
120225,5,07/01/2017,New runner with plantar fascitiis I am a new runner and have plantar fascitiis. These shoes are super comfy to run in. I would definitely get another pair and recommend to friends.,
120225,5,07/01/2017,"These got me through a half marathon :) I took a huge risk, but bought these a few weeks before a half marathon. I usually won't run a race in new shoes, but I know Brooks never have a break in period for me. These shoes did great! Zero break in, no blisters, and they were super comfy.",
120225,5,07/01/2017,Comfortable and Durable I have only bought Brooks Ghost running shoes for the past 4 years and will never switch to anything else.,
120225,5,06/30/2017,Almost perfect! Almost perfect but please size up a half size! I've always worn an 11M in BrooksBut this size runs a tad short. Needed to size up a hat size for a perfect fit!,
120225,1,06/30/2017,"Worst shoes I have ever bought I have bought the Brooks Ghost shoes for several years. They were my favorite running shoes and I would buy 3 or 4 pairs per year and they would last me several hundred miles per pair. Last year, I bought 3 pairs of the Ghost 8 and they were the worst shoes I have ever bought. The Ghost 7 and earlier models were typically a neutral shoe, whereas the Ghost 8 had way too much cushioning. It felt like my feet were being squeezed to death. I actually started to have ankle and foot problems when I started wearing them from lack of circulation. Also, they didn't last nearly as long as any other shoes. The outer tread wore down in less than a month. The outer mesh near my pinky toe had a hole that I repaired with duct tape because I didn't want to replace them so quickly. These shoes felt more suitable for walking than running; they didn't feel durable enough and didn't seem to suit a runner's needs.The same thing happened to my fiancé with the men's shoes. He has been an avid runner for years and bought the Ghost shoes. He purchased the Ghost 8 and the same exact things happened to him. We are both disappointed and frustrated and both of us stopped buying Brooks shoes.",
120225,5,06/30/2017,Ghost9 ,
120225,5,06/30/2017,Ghost run ,
120225,5,06/30/2017,"The Shizbombdig for Neutral Road Running The ghosts are awesome. I used to prefer the glycerin, but found that the cushioning was maybe too much (and too heavy) for this college MD runner. This shoe is light but sturdy enough for road running. I've had multiple pairs of these rad shoes, and they're the best neutral shoe for road running that I've encountered. They're rad to say the least.",
120225,3,06/30/2017,Ghost 8 was much better than Ghost 9 Very disappointed in the ghost 9. The Ghost 8's were so much better. These feel a half size smaller and they pinch in toe box. The sole wore out much quicker with the 9's and my 2 pair both tore in 2 places each. My 4 pair of 8's did not. I had knee pain in these but did not in the 8's. Very disappointing. The gtx 9 were much better. The colors were very nice but the 9's were otherwise quite disappointing. Also the cushioning was not as good. I hope Brooks will bring the 10's back up to their previous level of high quality.,
120225,5,06/30/2017,Amazing shoe for high mileage! I am so impressed with this shoe! It feels light and quick and holds up for my long runs very nicely. I used to be an Asics wearer but I always felt like their shoes were too cushiony- almost like running on pillows. The ghost 9 has just the right amount of springy response and cushion that doesn't bog you down. I just ran 6 miles today in them right out of the box and they were fantastic! I even shaved 2-3 minutes off of my normal run time in these. Will definitely be a loyal Brooks wearer from now on. Can't wait for the Ghost 10.,
120225,5,06/29/2017,Awesome Love my Brooks sneakers.  Let's me get a great solid workout in without irritating the nerves in my feet!  Have 3 different colors going now!! Would def buy again and have recommended to my friends. Convinced my husband to try over his tried and true brand and already had me order a second pair!  Worth the price!,
120225,5,06/28/2017,I will be buying more shoes ,
120225,5,06/28/2017,"Yes, yes, yes! Use these for walking my dog and running. Great fit for both exercises and feels very supported.",
120225,4,06/28/2017,Like the shoe. ,
120225,4,06/28/2017,"Nice cushion This shoe is nice and roomy in the toe box so my toenails are fine, but my bunions hurt on the side of my feet. I've run anywhere from 3-7 miles in them 6 times so far, either on the road, trail, or track.",
120225,3,06/27/2017,"Decent quality shoes with a few minor cons I really like the Ghost 9s due to their amazing, smooth heel to toe transition and durability. However, I am normally a size 8 and feel like these shoes run a tiny bit large in the toe box and the heel. I also have a pair of Mizuno Wave Rider 20s in a size 8 and they fit like an absolute glove and seem to have better heel stability than the ghosts. The ghost is a decent shoe though",
120225,5,06/27/2017,"Saved my ankles These shoes are sturdy, have great grip, and seriously saved my feet.  I hadn't physically been able to run, jog, or really walk faster than a stroll for almost a year.  A month in these shoes, and the stability and flexibility gave me exactly what I needed to get back to running.  I love the colors.  If you are unsure if you need wide or narrow, because you think you might need the extra width.....go for the wide.  The narrow just barely remains comfortable.  That would be my only issue.",
120225,5,06/27/2017,"After four pairs, the Ghost is MY SHOE! I have had at least four pairs of Ghosts now and absolutely love this model! I'm a casual runner, I go for a few miles at a time a couple times a week and run a few races per year. They're sturdy, with great cushion and look great, too! Most comfortable shoe I've had.",
120225,5,06/27/2017,"Best Running Shoe! This is my 4th or 5th pair of Ghosts, I love them! Every time I try another shoe I always come back! I don't have a wide foot, but I like extra room in the toe box and this is perfect! I also like the Glycerin as it has a similar feel, but Ghosts have more toe room!",
120225,5,06/27/2017,Love this shoe! Training for a marathon so I needed several pair of kicks. These are great as they break in fast and are comfortable on road or packed trail.,
120225,1,06/26/2017,"Have to return I have to return.  Thought i had ordered a wide.  When i spoke with an associate, i was told there was no need for a lot of wide widths.  But, it seems to me there IS a need if all the wide widths are sold out.",
120225,3,06/26/2017,"Not enough toe room. :( There is not enough room for my toes, unfortunately I am returning them. Wish they came in wide or were available in a half size larger for me to try. Always wear a 9 in Brooks but will find another pair, still love Brooks.",
120225,5,06/26/2017,Perfect fit the minute I put them on! This was my first pair of Brooks and I'm hooked! There will definitely be more in my future.,
120225,2,06/25/2017,"Different fit than previous Ghost versions. These are my 4th pair of ghost sneakers. I found there to be a drastic change in fit in these ghost 9's. I ordered an 8.5 as I had the previously and my toe hit the rubber on the tip of the sneaker. My forefoot also felt crammed as well. With deep regret, as they were my favorite sneaker by far, they will be returned.",
120225,2,06/24/2017,Disappointed with Mesh I finished my first marathon. The right shoe already has a rip. I was extra careful with this shoe. At the end of the Marathon I had 3 blisters. I heard good reviews but I am really disappointed. I thought I would be a brooks fan.,
120225,5,06/24/2017,I would buy this product in every color available! I am extremely active and run 3-5 miles 2-5 times a week. These are the most comfortable running shoes I've ever had. I'm hooked!,
120225,5,06/24/2017,Love these shoes. ,
120225,5,06/23/2017,"Favorite shoe This has been my favorite shoe for years. I loved the updates that came with the 9, as they gave the shoe a smoother ride and more cushion. I've never got a blister with these shoes, and never had to break them in. Even when I add my insoles, they still feel light.",
120225,5,06/22/2017,"Love these shoes! I just love these shoes and I can't believe I didn't try them sooner!  I have always had pain in my ankles and knees while running in other brands, but I have absolutely no pain while wearing these!  I have been able to increase my distances by at least a mile because without the pain, I can keep going longer.",
120225,5,06/21/2017,"These shoes are amazing! I run a few miles a few times a week. I previously owned the Ghost 6s, which were great, but switched to a different running shoe at advice of a running store. I decided to buy these as a back up since they were on sale, but these will become my main running shoe. They are so comfortable and supporting. They make running feel fun!",
120225,1,06/20/2017,hurt my feet. I am returning them ,
120225,5,06/20/2017,"Favorite shoe Love ghost 9 shoes. My fourth pair, and they are comfortable all the time. Never get sore feet.  The colors are also a fun accent.",
120225,4,06/20/2017,"Always wear Ghosts. Love 'em! I've been wearing Brooks Ghosts for many years. They change slightly from model to model, but are always the best shoes for me. Purchased my same size as always, but the Ghost 9 has a little toe cap that mades these feel a bit short and tight when I first put them on. Wasn't sure if I should go a size up or not. After a couple of runs, they feel better. Will probably try a half size up next time if the design is still the same.",
120225,5,06/20/2017,YES Reordered and got the next size larger and the wide width and the fit is great!  Very comfortable fit.,
120225,5,06/19/2017,"Love them! I love these shoes. I decided to get wide width for the first time in my life because my toes were feeling cramped in other shoes. The width feels great now, although I think I could have gone a half size smaller now that my feet have more room to spread out. Otherwise these are very comfortable!",
120225,5,06/17/2017,"I would buy this again! It's comfortable, and my feet don't hurt!  It doesn't aggravate my plantar fasciitis!",
120225,5,06/17/2017,On my 3rd pair love these shoes These shoes are so comfy.  I also have heel spurs and I don't have any issues when I'm wearing these shoes.,
120225,4,06/15/2017,"Liking my Ghost 9 I absolutely loved the Ghost 8 and just got my first pair of Ghost 9's.  I love them too, but my only reservation is that the toe area is much wider than in my previous shoes.  This causes me to feel like I am sliding off the front of the shoe when I go down hill.  I was able to adjust my lacing and tightness of tying to help prevent this.",
120225,5,06/15/2017,Good shoes Great for long distance running. I wear orthotics for my flat feet and these shoes work perfectly!,
120225,5,06/15/2017,"This is my third pair and the only sneaker I will buy! These are my walking sneakers and since I have a wide foot and need arch support, I have found the Brooks Ghost sneaker to be the best.  This is my third pair and the last pair I had lasted for 2 years. My only complaint would be the limited color selection for the Wide widths.  I would have preferred a different color but only had one option.  But for me, comfort outweighs fashion!",
120225,5,06/14/2017,"Very comfortable and airy shoe I love the mesh top as its very breathable for those hot days. Very comfortable on long runs which is a true test of a good shoe. I am concerned it may wear out quickly, but I am only about 30 miles into the pair so I do not know. They still look great at this point.",
120225,2,06/13/2017,Choose a less bulky shoe ,
120225,4,06/13/2017,Love them and the Color ,
120225,1,06/12/2017,This Iteration of the Ghosts is Terrible The toe moulding on this shoe is really a problem for me. It makes my toes go numb after running. I have used Ghosts for my long distance runs for years so this not-so-subtle change is very problematic. I see the Ghost 10s have reverted to the original toe moulding shape.,
120225,5,06/12/2017,Perfect fit! Perfect feel! ,
120225,5,06/12/2017,Awesome shoes ,
120225,4,06/12/2017,Great shoes! Great shoes! Never want to take them off! Needed to go one full size up so sizing seemed a bit off?!,
120225,5,06/11/2017,Fell back in love with Ghost So happy with the Ghost 9.  Was a huge Brooks Ghost 6 fan.  The Ghost 7 and 8 were changed enough that I actually went to a different brand.  Back to the Ghost 9 and they feel more like the 6.  Very happy and I am going to stock up on them just in case they change everything again.,
120225,5,06/11/2017,Good purchase These have been great for my running and walking. Just what I needed to replace my worn out Brooks I had.,
120225,5,06/11/2017,Best Running Shoe! ,
120225,5,06/10/2017,I love my new Ghost 9!!! It has so much cushion. I will continue to run in the ghost because of the cushion and comfort they offer,
120225,5,06/10/2017,Love Brooks I only wear Brooks! I love the ghost 9. I have the 7 & 8 and love all of them. They fit really well and last for a long time. I love the color I have had so many compliments. Can't wait for the 10 to come out!,
120225,5,06/10/2017,Fantastic Shoe! ,
120225,5,06/10/2017,Ghost 9 is my go to shoe ,
120225,4,06/10/2017,"Love this shoes! I only wear these to run, and they are the best running shoes for my feet. They have great support which helps with my feet having bad arches. They do get torn easily on the Inside of the ankle. I'm very aware of how I run, and all three pairs I have own get torn super easily within a few months (maybe it's how I run). Overall I would definitely get them again!",
120225,5,06/10/2017,I'm a dedicated ghost rider! Love Ghost 9! Loved Ghost 7 but the Ghost 8 was a bust. What I love about the 9 is the fit and the cushioning. The tongue and lacing area are comfortable (this area was very uncomfortable in the 8).,
120225,5,06/09/2017,Great shoe! I won't buy anything else from now on! ,
120225,5,06/09/2017,Perfect fit for flat feet ,
120225,5,06/07/2017,"Super comfy! I got these Ghosts after having had the Ravenna model for years and I really like them! Fun color, durable, comfortable, and supportive.",
120225,1,06/06/2017,Certainly different than the Ghost 8 I have returned the sneakers; they were so uncomfortable. When I took them off both my feet hurt. They lacked something that the Ghost 8 had. Very unhappy with this sneaker,
120225,5,06/06/2017,"Very comfortable right out of the box I have to have my left shoe lifted due to leg length discrepancy. These shoes work great for this, and are so comfortable and supportive.",
120225,5,06/05/2017,"Love this shoe! This is my 6th or 7th pair of Brooks, and I love this version the best of all! Even more comfortable than other versions, if that is possible.",
120225,4,06/05/2017,GREAT SHOE! I use these at the gym and absolutely adore them.  I have gotten several comments on the bright pink color as well!,
120225,5,06/05/2017,most comfortale shoes i ever ,
120225,5,06/04/2017,"On my second pair! I have worn Brooks running shoes for years. I switched from the Launch to the Ghost for increased toe box room and I love the ghost. I have a very slight pronation and prefer a neutral shoe, the Ghost provides just the right amount of support without being too stiff. I am on my second pair of these shoes and I love them. I have tried multiple other brands in the past and this is the only pair I have come back to over and over.",
120225,5,06/01/2017,Training for the 39.2 Avon Breast Cancer Walk I bought these for long distance walking and absolutely love them.  Love them so much that I bought a 2nd pair in a different color.  I  did buy 1/2 size larger than normal because I use an over the counter insert.  Perfect fit!  Love the color options too!,
120225,5,06/01/2017,"GREAT!!!!  So glad I was eavesdropping! I was in a shoe store and was eavesdropping on these two ""fitness buff"" gals and heard one tell the other they would have no other shoes but these.  So glad I eavesdropped!  I LOVE THESE SHOES!!  They are comfortable and very very good!  Thank you!  :)",
120225,5,06/01/2017,"Love, Love, Love Love these shoes, this is my second pair of the Ghost and I am very happy with them.  Like running in the clouds.  Love the stylish color and design, great fit and overall comfort of the shoe.",
120225,1,05/31/2017,Different design than past Ghost shoes I have worn the Ghost shoe for about 4 years now. I had to retire my Ghost 8 shoes and am so disappointed with the Ghost 9. I ordered the same size and width as before and find these so uncomfortable. My feet cramped within 15 minutes of wearing them. I wish they would go back to the Ghost 7 or 8 design.,
120225,5,05/30/2017,I love Brooks running shoes I've started running again and completed my first 10 mile race and half marathon in the past two months wearing Brooks Ghosts. Love them.,
120225,5,05/30/2017,"I've purchased the Ghost several times, always my 1st pick ",
120225,5,05/29/2017,I will buy this shoe again I like to run 5-7 miles on average 3-4 times a week on the side of the road.I have peroneal tendonitis and injured that ankle last year.My podiatrist recommended these shoes with my orthotics and I love them.,
120225,4,05/29/2017,Overall Good Shoe Overall good shoe - but I don't expect it to last for more than 9 months ( I work out heavily about 2-3 times a week).A little wider than the Ghost 8Only issue - top part in the back (sorry don't know shoe part name) keeps moving when I stick my foot in - which usually happens in older shoes.,
120225,5,05/27/2017,"These shoes are the best!  Great fit, quality as always. These are the best and the colors used are so nice.  Caused me to order a spare pair since I loved them so much!",
120225,5,05/26/2017,Love the Ghost! I locked into the Ghost line a few years ago and have just been upgrading to the new model each year.  Fits great and handles my orthotics well - no complaints!,
120225,5,05/26/2017,"Favorite Shoes! I just purchased my third pair of Ghost 9's and am considering stocking up because I never want to be without them. I thought blisters and other foot issues were just par for the course until I switched to these shoes. Now, never a blister; never foot pain. It's amazing what the right shoe can do. I have wider feet in the toe area but a narrow heel and these fit beautifully. My toes have room to spread out and my heel doesn't slip. I also love Brooks laces because they never come untied and I don't even double knot. I run several times per week up to half marathon distance and these hold up very well. My first pair has 350 miles and they still feel ok (but I'm phasing them out). Love love love these shoes!",
120225,4,05/25/2017,"I've worn Ghosts for years. I've worn Ghost for years.  This pair seems wide in the toe box.  Not so wide that I've returned them, however.  Just getting used of them at this point.  I wear orthodics and they work well in them.",
120225,3,05/25/2017,"Disappointed This shoe runs a half size too small and the detail at the toe is uncomfortable. It cuts right across the big toe and makes the shoe feel even smaller. I also feel that the ankle support is not as good as previous versions of this model. I loved the Ghost 8, maybe I'll see if I can find another pair.",
120225,5,05/25/2017,Love them.... Love this shoe...wore Brooks years ago and drifted away to Asics but I'm back :),
120225,2,05/25/2017,"I would not buy again.  Too soft for my needs. Prior pair had better stability.   If I lace the shoe snuggly before I walk, it works well for the first 1.5 miles, but needs to be adjusted after.  My knees get a twinge while walking as the shoe loosens.  I will be adding jogging again in a couple of weeks.  I am resuming more strenuous exercise after a health issue that caused me to take a break from usual walking and yoga routine.",
120225,5,05/25/2017,My feet are happy again. My podiatrist suggested wide shoes because of a bunion. I am very happy with these. I had these is the regular width before so I knew I liked them but the wider ones are even better!,
120225,5,05/24/2017,"A lot better than ghost 7 a lot better than ghost 7, comfortable and very good response on road running",
120225,5,05/24/2017,Love! This is my 10th pair of Brooks Ghosts. I have found the shoe that I love. The only con is that there are not enough color combos. I would love some new colors for my next pair.,
120225,4,05/23/2017,"Good Shoe I'm really enjoying these shoes.  Light weight and good traction.  I was sad that the shoes came with a nice scratch along the side before I even put them on.  Knowing they would get worn, I kept them any way.  The tongue bunches up and leaves marks on the tops of my feet but it's not so bad that I can't wear them.  Overall, it's a nice shoe and I'm happy to wear them.",
120225,5,05/23/2017,"Love the Ghost 9 I love the Ghost 9 over the Ghost 8  Just bought a new pair, lightweight and holds up well.",
120225,5,05/22/2017,"Great running shoe! So comfortable with it, it has wide toe box and really good for my bunions.  I talked to the customer service before I placed order, I was advised to take up one size up, which is just the right fit for me.",
120225,5,05/18/2017,"I will buy these every time! Brooks are my favorite shoe...I have really bad feet and need support. Even though I don't run anymore... just walk the trails, stationary bike and weights 5 days a week I need a good shoe. Brooks have been my pick for at least five years.",
120225,1,05/16/2017,"mesh does not wear well at all !!!!!! I am so tired of paying $120.00 to 140.00 on a pair of shoes and they last about 2 -3 months before the mesh has a hole in them by the toe areas and on the outer sides of the shoe where my pinky toes touch !!  I have never had this problem, EVER, until they began using mesh for every shoe that is made out there. Does not matter what model because the are all made out of horrible MESH !!!!  Only getting 2 months out of a pair of shoes at this price is ridiculous  !!!!!!!!!  Come on manufactures/designers make them out of something that will hold up !!",
120225,2,05/16/2017,Did not meet expectations especially for the price ,
120225,5,05/15/2017,Great shoe I am new to the running field and this brand was recommended by a friend. I am happy with this shoe.,
120225,4,05/12/2017,"Nice shoe, but slippery on some wet surfaces The Ghost is a quality sneaker and provides nice cushioning, support, and a roomy toebox. Unfortunately, traction on some wet surfaces isn't good. I live in the city and in a single run cover surfaces ranging from street asphalt to brick sidewalks, from pavers to dirt. Last weekend, I ran four miles in light rain and nearly slipped twice—and this morning, same thing. I've never experienced this with a running sneaker. Now I'm not confident about wearing the Ghost in wet conditions, which is disappointing. It could be the small tread size, or the type of material used for the sole. Brooks, you may want to investigate this!",
120225,3,05/10/2017,wish I could have more arch supoport ,
120225,3,05/09/2017,"Not as good as Ghost 7 Not as good as Ghost 7.  Never tried the Ghost 8 but heard it was not great.  The angle of the rubber strip at the toe has been changes so it now runs across the big toe instead of closer to parallel to the toes,  and it rubs and catches on my toe and nail, no matter how much I keep the nail trimmed.  Not as much of a problem with the second pair I got - the first pair wore holes in the toes of several pairs of socks",
120225,5,05/08/2017,Feel like I'm floating! These shoes make me feel like I am floating through my run.  Great cushioning in the ball of the foot where I tend to take a beating. Would definitely recommend.,
120225,5,05/04/2017,I would highly recommend this product! I bought these to restart my running and broke them in by walking around NYC for 4 days.  They held up well and I'm impressed so far!,
120225,5,05/01/2017,Love! I bought the AA Narrow Brooks Ghost 9 and love them!  Why did I wait so long to change over to Brooks.,
120225,5,04/30/2017,Ghost 9 LOVE these shoes! Got me through HM training last year and triathlon training this year,
120225,2,04/29/2017,"So disappointed in Ghost 9 I've been wearing an 8.5 in Ghosts for years and this was the first version that wasn't great right out of the box. The right toe box feels restricting, but the next size up was far too large and the placement of the arches also seem to be off. The Ghost 8 was a perfect shoe and I hope that the next version moves back in that direction!",
120225,5,04/29/2017,Love the color and the fit I have been running in the Ghost series for a few years now. I haven't been disappointed!,
120225,1,04/28/2017,Long term favorite now does not fit This has been my favorite make and model for years and was my go to shoe.  I was so sad that the form changed and now there is less room around the toes.  I am an 11 in dress shoes and a 12 in sneakers so I cannot size up and was crushed as I cannot find the Ghost 8 any place.  Go back to the old design!!!!,
120225,5,04/27/2017,"Hooked on the Ghost I love these shoes!  I'm hooked on the Ghost model, and I can't wait to rock these (or a new pair) during the NYC Marathon :-)",
120225,5,04/26/2017,"Adore my Ghost 9 I walk a lot, always wearing Brooks. I bought the walking shoes from brooks in black, was very excited to have them solid black. They did not work for my feet and I developed plantar fasciitis that hobbled me at the Disney Princess Run. In much pain I even spent $60 on new inserts at the expo, trying for some relief. I was excited to remember the 90 day guarantee and returned the walking shoes with no problem and relative ease! Thank-you Brooks! I replaced them with the Ghost 9 and am so happy to report that I am back on the trail. My PF is still there but with the G9's I walked 5 miles up and down hills yesterday on some nearby trails and am happy to say  this morning I could do it again today!Also- getting reports from the warehouse that my return has arrived and is being processed. Awesome customer support and I am a content Brooks customer.",
120225,5,04/24/2017,"I would definitely buy these again I bought these for working out but also to wear for work, being a nurse and on my feet 12-16 hours a day I have to have a comfortable shoe that won't make my feet hurt or tired.",
120225,5,04/24/2017,Perfect Fit! The shoes were broken in by walking 20+ miles in Disneyland. No blisters or hot spots!,
120225,5,04/23/2017,"These really improve my run! I'm 55 years old, and just started running about two years ago.  I find that my knees don't hurt as much when I run in these shoes, and my endurance is increasing.  They are lightweight but have good cushioning, unlike some other lightweight running shoes I've used.",
120225,5,04/23/2017,I would recommend to everyone! I use these shoes to run in everyday and they get me through the training season and I love them.,
120225,2,04/23/2017,"Not as good as past models I love Brooks and have been purchasing the Ghost shoes for the last 6 years.  They are the most comfortable and responsive running shoe I have ever worn.  I love how light weight and flexible the shoe is and never had any issues with them.  I just recently purchased the ghost 9 and I love the color combination and design of the shoe, however the front of the shoe does not feel the same as previous models.  I spoke with someone about this and they stated that a toe guard was added and that is why my foot is probably feeling so restricted in the front.  I even tried a half size bigger than my normal size and then the shoe felt a little awkward on my foot.  So unfortunately I had to return both sizes.  I love these shoes and am hoping that the company redesigns the next model that comes out this summer so I can feel confident in buying these again.",
120225,5,04/21/2017,"Love ghost brooks Brooks shoes are the only shoes I can put on out of the box then run 6 miles. I was these shoes to run in, then when they get too flat I wear them another 6 months for work which is 12 hours in the hospital",
120225,4,04/21/2017,"fits fine, didn't like colors The shoes fit fine, but I didn't like the color once I saw them in person.  I will re-order in a different color once the credit charge is on my credit card.",
120225,4,04/20/2017,"Ghost 9, Purple and teal ",
120225,2,04/20/2017,Tried and was not a good fit This shoe was recommended to me and I was hopeful of the cushioning but it did not work out. It was too heavy and made my feet feel like they were flopping around at the end of my ankles. I also ended up getting huge blisters which I've never had before.,
120225,4,04/19/2017,I have revisited this great shoe after using Launch 1&2. Great overall running shoe!  I'm a big fan of Brooks and LOVED Launch 1&2 but did not like feel of Launch 3 or 4 versions so I went back to the Ghost. I'm glad I revised this shoe but still holding out that they'll go back to more cushion version as in Ghost 4 or Launch 1/2.,
120225,1,04/19/2017,"Would not recommend! Extremely poor, cheap quality. I have only been wearing my brand new pair of shoes to group fitness classes at the gym for one week, and the sole of the left shoe has completely ripped off. There is no way these shoes could have lasted for even one distance run. Very disapppinted.",
120225,1,04/19/2017,Running small I have worn the Ghost running shoes for several years and this is my second pair of Ghost 9 but this pair seems to be off in the sizing.  My toes are towards the end of the shoe and get sore if I try to walk to much.  I haven't had this problem before so wondered if maybe the shoe was mis- sized or something.,
120225,5,04/18/2017,My favorite shoe!!! I love the Ghost 9's!!! I'm so glad that Brooks went back and made these feel more like the Ghost 6's which used to be my favorite shoe (I owned 6 pair of them). I wasn't crazy about the Ghost 7's (only bought one pair) and I didn't like the Ghost 8's at all (I never bought a pair of them because I knew by trying them on in the store that they were not for me). I've already purchased two pair of the Ghost 9's and will be buying more because I need a pair (maybe two) in every color - lol!!!,
120225,5,04/18/2017,"Very comfortable, I would definitely buy them again. I haven't got back into a workout routine yet, but looking forward to it with these shoes.",
120225,3,04/18/2017,no I have run for over 20 years and have worn Brooks  Ghost for the past 5 years.  Loved them until the Ghost 9 came out. Tried it and it was too short for my right foot.  Big toe hit front of shoe.  A larger size was swimming on my left foot which is slightly shorter. Fortunately after trying 2 other brands of shoes I found a pair of Ghost 8 's in my size and they are great! Please go back to the old styling and quit messing with the shoes every time the model changes.,
120225,5,04/17/2017,Yes I would buy this product again ,
120225,2,04/17/2017,"Not a fan of this year's (2017) Brooks Ghost Last year's (2016) Ghost was a great shoe, there was nothing about them that I did not like. This year's shoe is extremely uncomfortable around the toe of the shoe. I do not like the way it cuts across my big toe and puts pressure on my toenail. I don't know why anyone would mess with a great thing, I have been buying this same model every year for years now and never had any problems until now. Overall, pretty dissatisfied.",
120225,5,04/17/2017,Love these shoes! Very lightweight and comfy. Better than my glycerines! Decided on the GHOST because they had great reviews and are less expensive than the glycerines (better colors too). I am inpressed they feel better than glycerines! So light and comfy.,
120225,5,04/16/2017,This is my 5th pair of Ghost (whatever Number!) - obviously ,
120225,2,04/15/2017,"Would not buy again. My Podiatrist recommend I buy these shoes.  I don't see more room In the toe at all.  And after trying and trying to make these shoes comfortable to wear, I have come to the conclusion that they are too short.  I ordered true to size as your website suggested, but I do think I need a size 8.  Can I return them?",
120225,5,04/15/2017,I would buy these again. I have a wide toe box and bought these in a D.  They are perfect and are so comfort.  I would recommend them to anyone.,
120225,5,04/14/2017,very comfortable and very attractive. I wear these to work as I do a lot of walking up and down stairs as well. Very comfortable and responsive.  Plus it looks great with jeans and sweats.,
120225,5,04/13/2017,"Love the Ghost 9, have 2! I finally found a great shoe that keeps my foot stable when walking, already have 2 pair!",
120225,5,04/12/2017,Love the shoes but wish there were some more neutral colors. ,
120225,5,04/12/2017,great product ,
120225,3,04/11/2017,"Great Looking Shoe I loved the look of this shoe, but it was just too small, and yet, too wide in the toe box.  I returned them (a very easy process), but because of the toe box I did not order a larger size.  My other Brooks' will have to do for awhile.  I till love Brooks' shoes.",
120225,1,04/11/2017,"Did not work for me I wish Brooks hadn't messed with a good thing. I've been wearing the ghost for years, but I had to send my new ones back. They had less cushion and the arch support was awful. My feet did not like them as soon as I put them on. I did try them out, but regretted it as my feet bothered me for the rest of the day.",
120225,5,04/10/2017,Went from the Ghost 6 to the Ghost 9 and just as pleased! ,
120225,5,04/09/2017,"Love these! At 40 I decided to start running.  These are great on my bad knees, I've never had a problem after switching to this model.  They feel great and are exactly what I needed to kick off this new addiction.  Bonus, the color is fabulous!",
120225,5,04/08/2017,"I don't want to buy anything else!!! I have spent many many hours on my feet doing various jobs, I continue to do a job that has me on my feet all day. These shoes are by far the best most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn. My back, hips, legs, feet don't hurt nearly like they have over the years. I'm not nearly as fatigued. I just noticed a hole after about 6 months of wear and knowing it was time for a new pair and it is stressing me out so much I just want to get the same pair! But what if next time I need them they aren't being made anymore? They are more than I've ever paid for a single pair of shoes and worth every single penny. If you are on your feet for a long period of time these are the most comfortable shoes you will ever own. I imagine you can't go wrong with the Brooks line in general, but this was my very first pair. I was not disappointed. I have noticed they don't have that great of traction on wet surfaces but otherwise a great shoe.",
120225,5,04/07/2017,Ghost revisited I had Ghost 7's.  Decided to try others.  I have come back to Ghost!  So far I made the right choice.,
120225,5,04/06/2017,LOVE these shoes! ,
120225,2,04/06/2017,Unimpressed The material on the underside of the shoelaces towards the top of the shoe is rough and cut my toes during my first run. It happened multiple times. I also ordered half a size up and they are still small. Sizing is not accurate. Expect better from such an expensive shoe. I've had Brooks before but wouldn't buy this style again.,
120225,5,04/05/2017,"My favorite shoe. These are my third pair, and I love them.  I walk at least five miles every day, and they keep my feet comfortable, all the time.",
120225,5,04/04/2017,"Great Shoe: Transparent Company I did a lot of research trying to find a running shoe made by a company with ethical production and worker practices. I picked this shoe ultimately because of the transparency Brooks offers in their business practices. I am happy to also report that this shoe is one of the best I have had. I walk about two miles every day, and this shoe does not bother my knees or hips.",
120225,3,04/02/2017,"Sad to return First let me say that Brooks rocks for getting these to me in under 24 hours! I wasn't expecting them to arrive so quickly. I had high hopes for these shoes based on online reviews and Brooks website user reviews,  but was disappointed. I have wide-ish feet so I ordered the wide width, thinking they might fit similarly to my beloved and worn out wide width Glycerin 13 shoes. I could tell out of the box and walking around the house that the Ghost 9 wide width would be too wide for me, but I gave them a trial run at the gym anyway. As anticipated, my foot seemed to move around too much in the shoe and my feet just didn't feel stable in them... possibly over supination? I also felt like they rubbed on the bottom of my feet during my workout. They are rated as a cushion shoe, but I didn't think they were very cushioned or supportive. I am bummed out to have to return them, but appreciate Brooks' liberal try them out and return if needed policy. I thought about ordering them in regular width to see if that helped, but instead decided to order Adrenaline GTS to replace them. Hopefully those will provide me the stability and support I am looking for!",
120225,5,03/30/2017,"Perfect These are exactly as I expected, as always. So comfortable, durable, fit perfectly, lightweight.  Feels like a cloud on my feet. I don't even look in stores for these anymore since Brooks has free shipping. Just go right to website and get the color and size I want. Love it!",
120225,2,03/29/2017,"Didn't feel good on my feet I absolutely love brooks, but I just wasn't a fan of this shoe. I'm a nurse and I'm always on my feet, so when I go to the gym or go out running I really need a comfy shoe. It just wasn't a good fit for my feet. They were hard and uncomfortable. I read reviews and a lot of people love these shoes so I guess it depends on your feet, but I returned them. I also wasn't a fan of the color, I felt like I was wearing little girls shoes.",
120225,5,03/29/2017,Buy these ,
120225,5,03/28/2017,Love my Brooks ,
120225,5,03/28/2017,This is my second pair of Brooks. I think they are great !! ,
120225,5,03/28/2017,Best show ever I love this shoe. I had tried the trail running shoe and did not like it at all. This shoe is comfortable from day 1. I will definitely stick to this running shoe in the future.,
120225,5,03/28/2017,"Love them Am walking for exercise, but because of knee issues, I don't run.  I love them for walking on pavement or trail walking.  Just as instantly comfortable as my Ghost 7s.",
120225,4,03/28/2017,Great shoe! I have always loved the Ghost series.  However the Ghost 9 feels like there isn't support or cushion under the ball of the foot like there is everywhere else.  When I round a corner it feels like the inside edge of the shoe is not there.,
120225,5,03/27/2017,"Highly recommend this shoe!! I work in a restaurant and am on my feet all day on concrete floors! I have bought several different brands of tennis shoes. My last pair was the Ghost 8, I've had them for over a year, I just replace the insoles appx. every 3 months (athletic insoles) and I've also washed them in the washing machine and air dry. These shoes have with held the best of any!! I decided that I would stay with the Ghosts' so I purchased the 9's and hope the will last as long also!!",
120225,5,03/26/2017,I would continue to buy the Ghost. ,
120225,2,03/26/2017,I will not buy Brooks Ghost 9 again I work in them.   I fell in love with Cascadia and wanted to try a different shoe.   My co workers saw how well cascadia worked for me and tried others. Ravenna and Gts.,
120225,5,03/23/2017,"I love this shoe! I run with a group & train in the gym 4-5 days/week, so my shoes get used a lot. I absolutely loved the Ghost 8, so I was super happy to find that the Ghost 9's feel just as good! I love the Purple Cactus color & I've gotten endless compliments while I'm out running. These are my go to shoe for road & treadmill runs!",
120225,5,03/22/2017,No Regrets! The best shoes I have ever owned!  Thought I would regret spending the extra money on the shoes but they are well worth it!  My feet don't hurt after a run or a workout. They look good and feel great!,
120225,5,03/22/2017,Perfect Describe  yourself: regular walker (this category should be added as none of your descriptions fitP.,
120225,5,03/22/2017,Always my go to shoe. I have a neutral foot and I have consistently purchased the Ghost line at least 2x a year.  This pair has stayed true to the standard of the Ghost.  I have a wider foot which the Ghost fits.  There is a more expensive neutral shoe by Brooks but they are not wide enough so I stick with the Ghost.,
120225,4,03/21/2017,"Brooks are the best I normally wear the Glycerins, but I don't like the color selection.  So, I decided to try the Ghost.  At first, I found them a little stiff, but after wearing them for a while, they seemed to loosen up.  I don't find them as cushioned as Glycerin either.  I really wish Brooks would make a Glycerin in  primarily gray.",
120225,5,03/21/2017,"Perfect for running (only) These are my favorite because the width extends far enough forward to accommodate my pinkie toes so I don't have to order a wide width (which would be too roomy in the heel). They don't last forever. I just put on my second new pair of these and can't believe the difference; the cushioning in my first pair had disappeared completely after just a few months. Don't expect to get a ton of mileage out of these. But most importantly do not use these for a gym glass with floor work (like burpees). The first time I did that I thought I had lost a big toenail because of the way the flexible fabric and toe cap meet right at the tip of my big toe. Finally, I'm getting a bit tired of statement colors. If you don't like bright/hot pink the options have been very limited in the Ghost 9. Would love some more subtle blues, greens, etc. in the women's version. Despite the durability and color issues, these are still my favorite!",
120225,5,03/20/2017,Once they arrived I went right out for a run! Could not wait ,
120225,5,03/19/2017,the most comfortable sneaker! I'm on my feet most of the night at work. They really help my ankle/heel pain. Also do 12 miles/ week on the elliptical. GREAT SHOE! Very well constructed.,
120225,4,03/16/2017,Good Good shoes. Feel good. I tried the Cadence style first. They actually hurt my feet. I wear them on the treadmill right now. Hopefully on the gravel soon.,
120225,5,03/15/2017,My wife loves the shoes My wife loves the colors and it's her new favorite shoe to wear when she runs.,

These were great shoes....for about 3 months. Then the entire side of them ripped. I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.",
120225,4,03/12/2017,I would buy them again Bought these to train for a half marathon. I had the ghost 8 which I like but thought where a little heavy. I bought these because the reviews said they were improved from the 8. And they where accurate. The ghost 9 are light weight and don't feel as big as the 8.,
120225,4,03/11/2017,"This is my 3rd pair of Brooks! This is my second pair of Ghost. I had the Ghost 7- in teal and purple -my favorite color!! This is a close second. They were both size 9, but this one is much more snug. I had a pair of launches in between, but I found those to be less cushioning and more responsive. I have had issues in the past with plantar fasciitis pain, and these help immensely with that. Plus, I wear them for a 12 hr work day and my feet are fine at the end of the day.",

120225,5,03/07/2017,"Love these shoes! I bought these shoes to train for a half marathon. Since purchasing a month ago, I've run three times a week averaging 15 miles a week. So far I absolutely love the comfort, cushion, and speed of these shoes. I had shin splints from my prior running shoes but as soon as I switched to these my shin splints have gotten better. I usually run outside on sidewalks or trails often in wet conditions. Compared to my running partners shoes, my feet tend to stay dryer in wet weather, which has been a welcome surprise. The only complaints I have so far is make sure to size up as they run small (I went up a whole size, I usually wear 6.5 in casual shoes and ordered 7.5). Also, the laces on one side seem shorter then the other so it's harder to get a double knot but perhaps that's just unique to my pair. Overall, very happy with these Brooks Ghost runners.",
120225,5,03/07/2017,"Ghost 9's are FANTASTIC! I've been wearing Asics for many years, but was ready for a change. I'm so happy with my decision to purchase Brooks' Ghost 9 running shoes -- I love these shoes! They fit great, provide plenty of cushion and are lightweight. I run between 10-12 miles a week, (20 if I'm preparing for a half-marathon).",

I'm willing to give a little on the wet-weather/sloppy-leaves-all-over traction for the comfort they provide on all my paved runs and powerwalks. Since switching from Asics to Brooks' Ghosts I no longer have the numbness of previously experienced on 8-mile run/walks.",

120225,2,03/03/2017,"the new model fals short I have been a Brooks fan for 40 years. Adreneline, then the ghost. As a a runner doing 20 miles a week, narrow foot and high arch...these have been great. The Adreneline changed a few years ago and I switched to the Ghost, now the new design leaves the medial unsupported and puts too much pressure on the big toe to stabilize the run. Took a couple months to figure out why I had pain in my big toe. First the left foot then the right. Went back to my Ghost 7 (I have 4 gone thru 4 pair ) and the symptoms went away after a couple weeks. Now I'm trying the Glycerin for my narrow foot, as the choices are limited for that. I'm optimistic. Love the 90 day return, as it takes awhile to figure out an issue and I'm stuck with like new Ghost 8's.",
120225,5,03/03/2017,Great! ,
120225,5,03/03/2017,I LOVE THESE SHOES! They are the only ones I will buy! I am on my feet 8-10 hours per day and they used to hurt by the time I got home. Then I discovered Brooks Ghost. They are the only tennis shoes I will buy now! So comfortable and my feet don't hurt at the end of the day!,
120225,5,03/02/2017,New favorite everyday shoe I bought these shoes originally because I needed something supportive for work. They take me from desk work to standing and walking seamlessly.,
120225,1,03/02/2017,"What's up with the toe? The toe has a hard insert of some sort that makes it feel small and my toe rubs against it painfully.  Ghost 8 had a little of this, but now the toe is HARD--I can't wear them.  I sent them back.",
120225,1,02/24/2017,I wanted to love these but...... I wanted to love these as much as I loved my 8s.  But they made my toes numb with any run over 4 miles (and I tried on 4 different occasions).  I had 2 pairs of 8s that I loved and fixed all my foot woes (plantar fasciitis) but not these.  Thankfully I have a few miles left in my 8s but not sure what I am going to do then.,
120225,5,02/19/2017,"Yessss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My second pair of Brooks and the Ghost 9 by far has been my favorite running shoe ever!!!!!! I love how it delivers the comfort and support I need and when I need it, i'm a true Ghost 9  fan for life!!!!!",
120225,5,02/10/2017,"Durable, comfortable and supportive shoe! These shoes are ideal for those who are looking for a supportive, cushioned and lightweight running shoe. The order was shipped the next day and arrived 4 days later. It was well packaged and protected, no damage done.  I ordered Brooks because I had a good experience with my last pair from them. I use to race long distance in high school but now wanted something with more cushioning and support instead of speed and contact. To help decide on a shoe, I used the ""Shoe Finder"" survey the website provides and the Ghost 9 was recommended to me. The Ghost 9 are durable and well made as I bought these nearly 6 months ago, running/walking about 30 miles a week, and they are still holding up great. The tread wears down slowly and the material has not shown any signs of serious wear and tear. These shoes have great comfort and have never given a blister. They provide nice cushioning, perfect for runners who have had a joint injury or pain. They run true to size and broke in quickly, within 10 miles of use. The traction is very good, even in wet slippery conditions on the track or road. If they become wet, they dry without becoming stiff or snug. Even though they are not meant for rough terrain, they provide enough support for the occasional trail runs. I ordered the blue/grey color and they look exactly as pictured. Even now, they color still looks great and have not faded or show any stains. The shoelaces are a perfect length, long enough to tie but short enough not to drag or touch the floor. Though the price of these shoes is a bit steep, you get what you pay for; a long lasting shoe with great comfort. I highly recommend this purchase for a mid to long distance runner or walker.",
120225,5,01/19/2017,"Best shoes ever!!!! I can't say anything negative about these shoes.  I am 62 and try to walk 2 miles a day.  These shoes needed no ""breaking in"". I do have a bit of a wide foot but wide width shoes are usually to big.  I bought this shoe in the regular width and it fits great.",
120225,5,01/04/2017,"Best shoe I have ever tried! I am a college athlete, and have been using the Ghosts for almost the entirety of my college experience. These are the only shoes that have not contributed to any injuries that I have had - they are insanely durable, I am able to get upwards of 500 miles on them (though I wouldn't really recommend that! whoopsie - college budget). I think they're excellent.",

I use mine primarily for running and attending cardio classes at the gym.  The first time I wore these shoes I was in for rude awakening when doing a Burpee at one of the classes.  When kicking my feet back into pushup stance, the detail over my left big toe just about ripped my toe nail off.  It lines up perfectly, I thought it was a fluke but when I tried again the same thing happened.  That little ridge over the big toe area that you added is unnecessary.  Needless to say I no longer wear these for the cardio classes since there are always Burpees involved.  The last thing I want to say is to please consider using light Gray or a coordinating color on the soles instead of Bright White. Like you do for the Gortex models.  I am very hesitant to buy because of the white on the sole but love the Ghost so much I always cave and buy them anyway.",
120225,2,12/29/2016,pressure point makes them unwearable Received as a gift and was on my wishlist.  However this pair of Ghost fits differently than all the others I have.  There is a pressure point that numbs my toes quickly and causes a shift in posture that makes my back hurt as well.  The exchange policy for a gift REQUIRES the giver being the one who makes the exchange which  is inconvenient and a disincentive to ever buy another gift from Brooks. Giver and recipient  both loose.  I have loved Brooks for many many years but this will probably be my last pair.,
120225,5,12/27/2016,"I really like the Ghost 9 I like the Ghost 9 as much, if not better than the Ghost 8 - they are really comfortable.",
120225,1,12/25/2016,"Shreds within a month The fabric around the toes and the lace holes ripped to shreds within a month. The rubber around the sides had coloring.  With time this wore off, too.  The rubber around the sides of the sole has a pattern that easily nicks. The shoes absorb and holds water when wetted.  Use for dry weather only and indoors only.",
120225,3,12/23/2016,"Poor design on detail cutting across toe I'm a loyal Ghost supporter, this is my eighth pair.  I use them for running and to attend Cardio classes at my gym.  Upon wearing them the first time to class, when jumping down/kicking back into push up stance to do a Burpee, the detail on top of the left shoe almost took the toe nail of my big toe off.  The way it cuts in across the top of the shoe just isn't good.  This was not a fluke cause I tried the Burbee again and experienced the same discomfort.  Wondered if anyone else has experienced this.  My only other complaint is to replace the bright white soles with gray or coordinating color that match your vibrant colored shoes like you do on the Gortex Ghost.  I am typically hesitant to buy shoes with that bright white soles but I love Ghost I always cave. Thank you",
120225,2,12/11/2016,"Not the Ghost 7 or 8, unfortunately The previous wonderful Ghost shoes (recommended by my foot doctor) fixed all of my foot problems. However after just a few miles wearing the Ghost 9 shoes the old plantar fasciitis returned. Tried my old Ghost 8's and all became well. Returned to the 9's and pain returned.",
120225,4,11/19/2016,Best Running Shoe Ever...Except I purchased two pair because they felt that great but just like my other Brooks Ghost 7's (I skipped the 8's and went back to Asics)the soles do not grip on concrete in wet weather and the soles don't last more than 300 miles.,
120225,5,11/10/2016,"IT Band Problem Solved I came down with IT Band Syndrome 2 weeks ago for the first time ever. I was so depressed and confused and didn't understand why. I began foam rolling like crazy and stretching. I took about a week off only to be disappointed that it returned. The only thing i hadn't done was think about my footwear. I was desperate. I did some research on shoes and decided to over night ship and order the Ghost 9. I went out for a 3 mile run and words cant describe how great these shoes felt on my feet. Lightweight, my toes had room, and great cushion. Best of all, no pain in the leg i was expiereincing ITBS. I was wearing the Glycerin 14 prior to ordering these. I believe i worn them down too much. Impressed and will continue to run in these! Highly recommend!",
120225,5,10/26/2016,My feet have never felt better! ,
120225,5,10/22/2016,The Best Ghost Yet! Just took them out of the box and ran 5 miles and my feet feel great! I've owned the last 3 Ghost shoes and this wide width in black is my favorite so far. Looks good and has plenty of support and cushioning (especially in the heel which is where I wear out the tread). It's light weight and a great neutral shoe.  Ghost's are also durable. I run about 15-25 miles a week and they last until the next pair is released. (Though I believe you're supposed to change your shoes more often.) Happy running!,
120225,5,10/19/2016,"Comfortable shoe! I was looking for shoe that wasn't too flexible, a narrower ankle, and a wide toe box. The new updates to this shoe such as the upper and the wider toe box just make the shoe feel great. Also, the bottom of the shoe near the toe feels tapered so that it feels like it propels you forward. Lastly, I like how the cushion is not so much so that you feel like you are sinking into the cushion. I wish this shoe had a 10mm drop like the glycerin which can make you feel taller. I use this shoe on trails and road. I also really like all the colors that have been released (I wear the Black and Purple right now).",
120225,5,10/18/2016,Grest Shoes I got these as a gift I had ruptured my Achilles tendon and hadn't walked in shoes for 2 mths. They fit like a glove and cradle my feet with support will be a long time before I can run but I won't but any other shoes my husband and son were the Beast.... BEST SHOES EVER,
120225,4,10/17/2016,Comfy. ,
120225,4,10/17/2016,Great support Shoe is too small need next size up. Need to return this pair and really order,

120225,4,10/11/2016,So comfortable I have plantar fasciitis and Brooks feel the best!  I rotate three pair because I have a problem with the tread pulling in the front.,
120225,5,10/10/2016,Great shoe! Fantastic shoe for all day wear at work. I am constantly on my feet at work and it is great to get home at night with no foot pain.,

120225,4,10/06/2016,"Finally found a great shoe! I bought these toward the end of my marathon training but wish I had done so sooner.  I had gone from the Transcend 2's, which I quickly realized were too heavy for me after just one run in my new Ghost 9's.  I also wore these for a very wet and rainy marathon and they held up nicely.  Since they were almost new I didn't have to worry about traction.  I definitely would recommend these as they are light and don't make you feel like a Clydesdale while running and will continue to wear this shoe for further races.",
120225,5,10/06/2016,"I love these shoes Very comfortable. I'm a bit picky about my shoes. So, I like the light weight, the softness combined with good support. My last pair of shoe were by another brand and they were highly rated, but they didn't feel right - the heel was a bit stiff and they were actually a bit noisy when walking. My brooks are quiet and comfortable, but supportive for my runs and walking the dog. Comfortable all day.",
120225,5,10/05/2016,"Would Order Again and Again My dog ate my first pair of Ghost 9s so I started wearing  my Nike's again, but my feet would hurt so badly by the end of the day. I ordered the same pair that was eaten, and I could immediately tell a huge difference in how my feet and back felt. I am so happy! These are the best shoes I've ever worn.",
120225,4,10/02/2016,"Love the color still waiting for them ""to break in little."" Bought first pair last year for work( I am ER RN on feet 12 hours) ...I LOVED them ...immediately comfortable. This year I  did not  get that immediate satisfaction...that oh so comfy feel when I put on my new Ghost. Seem like this new pair the heel support is stiff not as bouncy as my old pair....I am hoping to ""break them in."" I love the color, style and the fit is perfect. I did recommend Brooks to a coworker he bought the GTS and LOVES them!",
120225,5,10/02/2016,"I love the Ghost! I run 50+ miles a week and these shoes have worked great.  I accidentally ran about 700 miles in my last pair, but they performed well.  This shoe is very comfortable in the foot plate, as well as the mesh upper.  The color is perfect too!",
120225,4,10/02/2016,"Love the color! Everyday shoe, it's only women's shoe large enough that fits right. Could use more arch support.",
120225,5,10/01/2016,Excellent shoe for rehabilitation of the foot post injury Excellent shoe post injury. It has excellent support with a nice wide toe box. Love this shoe!,
120225,2,09/30/2016,"Miss the Ghost 6 and 7 I am very disappointed that you have changed the fit from the Ghost 6 and 7 which the former was perfect and the latter is okay.  I had to return the 9 as they didn't seem to fit the same way.  They didn't give support to my ankle area.  They just didn't feel like the two pairs I have know.  Why stop a product, Ghost 6 and 7 when they are working?????",

120225,1,09/29/2016,"pain in heel, pain in arch, can barely walk after a run. I have always been a Ghost wearer.  LOVE Ghosts.  Recently replaced my 8's with the 9's and it's been the saddest time.  THe shoes aren't cheap.  I cannot wear the 9's.  My heel and my arch- both feet are in so much pain. I can hardly get out of bed in the am after the day before run. No pain while running in them or wearing them, taking them off and the next day, I DIE. DEATH.reluctantly put on my 8's yesterday for a run. NO PAIN.  OMG. I'm so so sad by this.",
120225,5,09/29/2016,"Awesome shoes for a Beginner in Running I have tested this shoe to the limits, Outdoor Running, 5k, 10k, gym, trail/gravel. I am a beginner at running and the support from the Ghost 9 is amazing! I used so many different brands, wasted so much money on shoes that wear quickly and I am very confident in these Brooks Ghost 9 shoes. I believe the slogan, voted best shoes by runners because this shoe delivers! And the best part I love is the shoe is very light weight but with lots of support. Very RARE find. I do not like shoes that weight my feet down so this is very satisfying! I loved it so much, I bought (2) more pairs for back up.",
120225,4,09/24/2016,"These do not run small I bought these a full size larger based on the suggestions online but would have been better getting them a half size bigger. Thank goodness for really thick, plush Brooks socks!",
120225,4,09/23/2016,Brooks have always been my walking / running Shoe The shoes are great with the exception of a blister on the back of my heel at the top of the shoe.  I have worn Ghosts before and have never had this problem but the very first week I got the Nines I did a lot of steep hills both up and down and attribute the activity to that since the shoes were not fully broke in yet.  I believe the blisters will pass and would still recommend this shoe.,
120225,5,09/22/2016,great shoes ,
120225,5,09/20/2016,"Love LOVE my new kicks! As a daily walker, these shoes are just what I wanted/needed.  Comfy, lightweight, and hey, the color makes me stand out as well!  Also work well in the gym - stability is perfect for the workouts I participate in.",

120225,4,09/10/2016,"I wanted to love them and almost did I had to send them back because they were just too short for the size although I really wanted to love them.  They were too wide for me (I wear a narrow) and I tried with different inserts and gel pads to add some filler but in the end I couldn't stay back in the shoe, slid forward and was right at the end.  Phooey.  I liked the arch support and the comfort of the foot bed.  Have to decide if I want to try the next 1/2 size up; width would still be troublesome for my foot.",
120225,5,09/07/2016,Love the new Ghost! I love the new Ghost.  I do a lot of different activities and the fit is very versatile to whatever I am doing.,
120225,5,09/04/2016,"Super comfortable👊 I only wear these shoes for work in the emergency room. I am a nurse and work 12 hour shifts. These are super comfortable. The only drawback is how hot and sweaty my feet get In these shoes. And I have tried numerous different brands of socks. But for the comfort, I can deal with sweaty feet! 😁🙌🏼",

120225,4,08/30/2016,"Great shoe, Good Price I am a daily 4-mile medium-pace walker.  The Ghost is a good shoe for me--good support and construction.",
120225,5,08/29/2016,"L.O.V.E. 100% happy with this one. I ran in the Ghost 7, which was also a good one, but did not like the fit of the Ghost 8, so I ran in the Launch 2 for over a year. The new Launch 3 is too narrow for me, so I tried the Ghost 9 at a local running store. They allowed me to take a pair out for a 5 mile run, and I realized before hitting the first full mile that I had a great pair of shoes on my feet! This pair gives me that foot-hugging feeling I'm used to from Brooks (especially in the heel area), but also gives my wide feet plenty of room in the toe box, which is missing in the Launch 3. I have replaced the insole with Powerstep insoles for an extra layer of arch support. So far I've run about 60 miles in this pair and they're absolutely perfect for me.",
120225,5,08/27/2016,My 1st pair of Brooks and I LOVE them! I was in the middle of training for my first half marathon and I was concerned that I'd have to break in the shoes. There was no break-in. I immediately felt like they were meant for my foot and that I could run in them forever. I've never been happier with a pair of tennis shoes before.,
120225,5,08/26/2016,"Best Shoes Ever The ghosts are my favorite shoes and the ghost 9s are the best yet. If you're undecided, definitely get them. I can't recommend them strongly enough.",
120225,5,08/26/2016,Love Love I have spent way to much on Shoes just trying to find a brand that I could wear no matter what I was doing. I Love my shoes. Thanks Brooks. I will never have another Brand. You have a life long Friend in me.,
120225,5,08/25/2016,I love it. ,
120225,5,08/24/2016,"My favorite yet! I've owned the Ghost 7,8,& 9 along with glycerine's. I felt like the Ghost 8's were a total flop, and was nervous to get the Ghost 9's, but they have been my best running shoe yet! I went up another half size in these, but the comfort level is amazing now. I run about 3x per week, putting in around 15-20 miles/week and I have no complaints!",
120225,4,08/24/2016,"Good feel I am wearing these in the gym now to break them in, but I do run on a track or treadmill. I have some knee pain that I don't get when I wear Adrenaline 15. They have a little less support in the arch especially in the left shoe, but are light and springy like I was looking for.",
120225,5,08/23/2016,"The Ghost is BACK! So, I was one of those people that LOVED the ghost all the way through 6 and then 7 and 8 were a huge disappointment. I needed new shoes again and thought I would try the ghost again and the ghost 9 is everything is used to be and all the things I couldn't stand in the 7 and 8 are gone. If you used to be a ghost person and had to find a new shoe... come back!",
120225,1,08/23/2016,More longing for Brooks Ghost 7 Ghost 7 was perfect for my feet. I've tried Ghost 8 and 9 and they're not the same. Just bought Glycerin 14 in the hopes they would be better. Same problem. Also there didn't seem to be much more cushioning than the Ghosts I tried. I guess you aren't the shoe for me anymore.,
120225,1,08/20/2016,Very disappointed. I'm a runner who had these shoes recommended to me because I like a neutral shoe.  I have a pair of Glycerin's which I wear occasionally but I was hoping these would be less heavy.  These shoes felt like they were wearing me!  Every step was heavy and plodding.,
120225,5,08/20/2016,Wow. Fixed my underpronation! Bought these for underpronation and they are awesome! They run a little narrow so be careful of that. Very satisfied!,
120225,5,08/19/2016,"Perfect fit! First pair of brooks, ordered them online and was nervous they wouldn't fit right for the price. I have flat arches and these are great. They dont rub funny anywhere. I'm and a massage therapist and these are great for standing all day.",
120225,5,08/19/2016,These are GREAT! I work as a manager in the ED and I am up and down all the time.  My Dansko's were hurting my feet and several nurses brag about the Brooks so I got 2 pairs and so far really love this pair...I have not used the other pair yet,
120225,4,08/19/2016,"Yay, Brooks! You Fixed the Ghost!! As a marathon runner, I need a shoe that's 100 percent comfortable. The previous Ghost 8 was an awful change to this previously great sneaker. I wore one pair for a short time. It was too narrow and stiff and painful! The Ghost 7 before it was very comfortable. Finally, Brooks has fixed the Ghost with the Ghost 9. It is roomy in the toe area, made of stretchy fabric and laces, and is free from the uncomfortable stitching and design that made the Ghost 8 so unwearable. The Ghost 9 was comfortable the moment I put it on and ran in it.  A great update and a very good Brooks sneaker!",
120225,5,08/18/2016,Love this shoe! I  am in my 60's and try to run at least 2 miles a day. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I ordered another pair in a different color just to wear for every day because they felt so good! Received many compliments on them.,
120225,4,08/17/2016,"Great shoe! I love this shoe!  Light weight, fits well, good shock absorption, support  and good to look at. I might buy another pair!  The only criticism I have is they slip if you hit a wet surface.",
120225,5,08/17/2016,"Love! I have been wearing the Brooks Ghost for years and the 9's are great!  They are very comfortable and I particularly LOVE the Olympic design for fun! I highly recommend the Ghost. They are my ""go-to"" running shoe because they are comfortable, durable, lightweight.  My foot just feels at home in them- like a favorite old sweatshirt that you just never want to get rid of... Except new every few months... Lol  I do have a 2nd/alternate pair of shoes that I train with and have yet to find anything that compares to the ghost.",

120225,4,08/16/2016,"Great shoe for me I love the Brooks brand.  Unfortunately, I tend to be a bit tough on shoes and my little toes poke holes in the sides all too soon it seems.  Once that happens, they do not wear well for walking.",
120225,5,08/12/2016,"I LOVE these!!! I have been wearing the ghost 7 gtx' s and loved them. I am a teacher but spend football games outside with my students and my feet always get wet so I bought the gtx' sand fell in love with Brooks. I don't want to wear them out so I decided to get the regular ghosts. I tried the 8s when the went on sale before the 9s came out and I didn't like them. Too tight on the top of my feet. Felt weird and not roomy at all. So I decided to take the plunge and get the 9s full price! When I first got them I was barely able to run a mile and had just started to go to the gym. Now I can run 4-5 miles a day on the elliptical and 3-4 miles on the track!  My feet have never hurt in these, I've never gotten blisters, and I've never had to break them in. I love love love these shoes!!!! I can walk the trails in my town or run on the track or even do errands around town. They are so comfortable I never want to take them off. They are roomy in the toe but they fit like a glove around my arch area. I hope they never change this shoe because they are simply the best shoes I have ever worn!! Ever!!  I am not the athletic type but these shoes MAKE me want to go out and run!! I told my husband how amazing they are and he went out and got the men's version for himself. Simply the best shoe ever.  The only thing I don't like about these shoes are that there aren't more colors with black!! I'd probably buy more!!",

OMG the ""cushion"" under your feet are hard as a brick, my last 2 ghosts felt like I was walking on fluffy pillows, put these on, took just 1 step and was like WHAT?! no, the most uncomfortable shoe to even walk in, so tried it out on the treadmill there, 5 minutes into the run, I was done, put them back in the box and said no thank you.  Maybe my ghost 8's will hold out....",
120225,5,08/10/2016,Best running shoes yet! I usually buy a different light weight brand shoe but was not finding them comfortable for long hospital shifts. I bought two pairs so that I could work out in one pair and they are perfect for running as well. The silicone heel makes a huge difference in comparison with other brands! Will definitely be buying these from now on!,
120225,5,08/05/2016,Best sneakers I have ever owned I love my Brooks. I have struggled for years looking for a pair of sneakers that did not hurt my feet after a few miles. 70plus miles on my new Brooks and my feet are still happy and shin splints are gone. Thank you Brooks I am a believer that people with big feet can have happy feet now .,
120225,5,08/03/2016,Ghost 9 I walk 5 to 6 miles 5 days a week. These shoes were comfortable from the beginning. Lots of good support. I have very wide feet at toes and most shoes hurt after several hours. Not so with them. Great shoe.,
120225,5,08/01/2016,LOVE ,
120225,5,07/31/2016,Great shoe for walking I only walk and this shoe is great. The Brooks walking shoes are ugly so I ordered these instead.,
120225,1,07/24/2016,"What Happened?? So highly disappointed with this new 9 model.  Mind you I absolutely have loved this shoe since I began purchasing with the 4,5,6,7,8 but I don't even recognize the look or the feel of this one.  I could actually feel the line going straight through the middle of foot and no cushion feel on the heel or toe area.  The clerk told me that had been changed and Brooks had decided to place the gel in a different place this time.  Absolutely crazy!!!!  I couldn't walk in them anymore to see what else might have been uncomfortable..  I don't understand why Brooks had to make such a bold changes to a shoe that was working for a lot of faithful Ghost buyers.  They change so much they need to make a new name for this shoe and bury the Ghost sadly.  I was scrambling at the shoe store to find something I could wear as its been years I have had to do so.  Right now I left with Aspics Gel Nimbus 18 as the clerk said it was close to what the Ghost had been in previous versions.  I notice they are still selling the Ghost 8 on line so I might go that way also.",
120225,4,07/23/2016,"The ""go to"" Ghost 9 Funny how only a few ounces can make a difference in a shoes.  I love the extra cushioning, but I'm having to get used to the slightly heavier shoe.  This is still my ""go to"" shoe for almost everything I do in the gym and outdoors, and I anticipate the newest release.  Just wish they offered more color choices like they have done with the launch lately.  You'd think they would do that given that it is probably the most popular Brooks shoe on the market for both men and women.  Overall, this is a great shoe.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I noticed the heavier weight of the shoe.",
120225,4,07/22/2016,"Great cushioning and not too heavy, a bit tight on the toes. I bought the Ghost 9 shoes for training runs and running 5k's (on the roads) this summer. The cushioning feels just right on the heel; but after a 5k, my toes were numb and sore when walking. I guess the toe box is not as open or long as my Ghost 7's. I thought it was a fluke and they needed some breaking in, but after 2 weeks, my toes still feel bruised after my runs. I will have to return these and look for a better fit; maybe I should try the Glycerin?",
120225,5,07/22/2016,"Light but stable shoe After running in the Adrenaline for many years I switched to the Ghost a couple of years ago when I lost a good bit of weight. It is a great lightweight shoe, compared to the Adrenaline, but still provides good support and stability. I wear a half size larger than my normal shoe size and have plenty of room in the toe box (haven't bruised or lost any toenails). Definitely a shoe to look at if you want something lighter and faster than the typical stability shoe.",
120225,5,07/21/2016,"More red women Brooks running shoes please I wear typically Brooks Glycerin for my running (marathon or half training), but bought the Ghosts for work (walking around hospital) once I saw the red color and stars. I also bought this color combo in Brooks Glycerin.",

120225,3,07/20/2016,"Why no notch at heel? This version is more flexible than the 8. While the forefoot is cushioned, it feels almost too soft and I can feel the road more when I power walk than I did with the 8.  My biggest problem with the 9 is that Brooks got rid of the notch at the ankle! Why? Now this shoe rubs my achilles, especially on my smaller foot. Now my left achilles tendon is bothering me. I may not be able to keep these shoes. I am shocked that your shoe designer would remove the notch. Please put it back!",
120225,3,07/20/2016,Inferior material Love them they just ripped after 1 week of use. Hoping to be contacted as I think mine must be defective,
120225,3,07/20/2016,"Same Issues as Ghost 7 I used to wear the Ghost 7 for distance and trail running.  I had several pairs.   They made it through training and a marathon last year.  I liked them, but I always had trouble with the laces coming undone and with the balls of my feet causing my toes to get a little numb.  I then bought Ghost 8s, but didn't like them much.  So, I switched to another brand of shoe this year.  When I recently saw the Ghost 9, however, I thought, ""Yay!""  I ordered them.  But they have the SAME problems as the Ghost 7. They are OK for just wearing around, but I will go back to the other brand of shoes for running.",
120225,5,07/20/2016,"2nd Pair Already The hubs got me my first pair right when they released and I absolutely loved them!  Most comfortable Brooks shoe for me yet.  Just the right amount of cushioning while still being responsive so I can run any pace I'm going for.  Ran a 12K in these a couple of weeks after getting them and had zero aches and pains.  That, I must say, is an amazing experience to me since I have been dealing with knee pain all my life.  Even though this is a neutral shoe, I felt very stable and connected to the ground without feeling the jolt of the pavement.  I may have made my wonderful man a little jealous with the way I talked these shoes up, but he went and bought me another pair (the Victory Collection Ghost 9s) anyway.  Gotta love a man who knows what a woman wants!",
120225,5,07/20/2016,"Beautiful comfortable shoes I love Brooks sneakers. They are a little pricy, but worth the money. I love that you can wear comfortable, reliable sneakers that also look great when wearing them. These new ghost sneakers are my favorite. They are the most comfortable, whether it be wearing them to work, or going for a walk/run.",
120225,5,07/20/2016,Fabulous I use them for running and for work. My feet are so happy. Before I got ghost 9 I was wearing new balance and my feet were sore by the end of my 12 hour shift.,
120225,4,07/20/2016,Great Shoe I average about 25 miles a week in these shoes.  love every aspect of them.  Becoming a Brooks freak.,
120225,4,07/19/2016,Ghost 9 Review I'm an avid runner and over the years I've only used Brooks.  These shoes never disappoint!  Perfect support especially when I've suffered from lower back pain and knee issues.  I've purchased the Launch as well and wanted to try the Ghost.  I've been very impressed so far.  I look forward to training season and plan to run several half marathons with my new shoes.,
120225,4,07/18/2016,"Love it These are amazing shoes! I loved my Ghost 7's and had to come back for the newest installation. I think I'm going to have to get a different insert that is more supportive of my high arches, but all in all I'm loving these shoes.",
120225,5,07/18/2016,"Love it! I used to have Ghost 7 and really loved them, but I avoided Ghost 8 because of all the negative reviews. Since I ran through the six pairs of Ghost 7s I had stockpiled, I decided to give Ghost 9 a try -- and I'm so glad I did! They are perfect. Love, love, love them. I'll be stockpiling these as well! :)",
120225,5,07/18/2016,Great shoes Love everything about these shoes! I would highly recommend for distance runners and walkers.,
120225,5,07/17/2016,Great Shoe I got these after my last pair of sneakers wore out and began to hurt my feet. They are comfortable and fit me perfectly.,
120225,5,07/17/2016,"Great update! Great update from the 8s, which I felt were too heavily and chunky.  These are more streamlined and llighter.  My only complaints are that they are a tad narrow on the outside front of midfoot and need more color choices.",
120225,5,07/16/2016,"Ghost 9 My Favorite Ghost So Far I LOVE the Ghost 9! I have been wearing the Ghost shoes since the 7 and these are my favorite so far. They feel great on the foot. Flexible and comfortable! I already want another pair before they sell out of these! Much better than the Ghost 8, which I found a little stiff. They kind of remind me of the Ghost 7, only better!",
120225,5,07/16/2016,"Love this one! I have had 4 pairs of the Ghost series. These Ghost 9s are my favorite yet!  I wear a wide and I was able to get these in one of the cool looking colors. I wish they would make more colors in the wide. The wides are usually sold out very quickly. The Ghost 9 wides don't look wide. They cinch in nicely on the sides. I am a runner and I also do hiit workouts 6 days a week and I wear them for both. My feet used to hurt when I ran until I got the Ghost series of shoes. PLEASE Brooks:  with the newer versions to come, continue to make them like the 9s!!",
120225,5,07/15/2016,"Great Replacement for GTS15 EE Width The Ghost 9 is the only replacement shoe I've found for the GTS15 in a EE width. The GTS16 update made the entire shoe bigger, not just the toe box, so my feet were swimming in the EE. Fortunately, the Ghost 9 is a worthy successor, and my new favorite. The fit is much more glove-like, with a nice snug feeling that keeps my feet feeling comfy whether putting on the miles or standing for hours at work.",
120225,5,07/15/2016,"super shoe I teach middle school PE, so needed a cushioned shoe that is not heavy and can be worn all day. This shoe works well for that, also I'm a sidelined trail runner because of chronic plantar fasciitis and the Ghost 9 allows me to do flat surface walking without overly irritating my heel while trying to get over the condition.",
120225,3,07/14/2016,Not as good as before The feel of the Ghost 6 was much better. Not sure what's off about this one but doesn't feel as durable or comfortable and feels a half size too big.,
120225,5,07/13/2016,Great shoe I'm in the Air Force so I work out a lot and these shoes are great. Very comfortable and just enough cushioning to support your foot without sinking into it.,
120225,5,07/10/2016,Awesome shoe! I'm a fairly new runner and have had issues with sore feet and my feet feeling like they've gone to sleep. I did not experience either of those issues with the Ghost 9. They are awesome and am considering another pair for everyday wear!,
120225,5,07/09/2016,"I like them VERY MUCH!! I use them indoors and outdoors.  I wanted to get out of flip flops.  They were not good for daily use,so I got this sturdy shoes.  Works GREAT.  Thank you.",
120225,5,07/08/2016,"Running Happy! Always training for endurance races and am heavy/hard stride.  These shoes ride/glide like a ""ghost"", quiet and great cushioning support while lightweight.  Plenty of room in toe box and when laced up feet stay put to ensure support for landing and acceleration.  My favorite version of Brooks Ghosts so far!!",
120225,5,07/07/2016,Best shoe ever!!!!! Most comfortable shoe for someone with feet issues. Cushion helps with tight achilles tendon. Great arch support for those who have high arches.,
120225,4,07/07/2016,Great shoe I would rate this shoe a 4.5 out of 5.Very lightweight and comfortable.This is the shoe you can put on for the first time and run/walk for miles and have no issues.I would highly recommend this shoe.,
120225,3,07/06/2016,"Runs small I've worn the ghost for the past three or four years, my foot is a size 6.5 but I buy a size 7 running shoe, I received these ghost 9 from my son for a late Mother's Day gift and they are so small, my toe goes all the way to the end...I ran 3 miles in them this morning and my big toe is sore.  I've never had this issue with my Brooks before.  I would recommend trying these on in a store before purchasing online",
120225,4,07/06/2016,Comfy and stylish Great shoes for those seeking comfort but my feet do slip around a little from time to time. Not ideal for trail running but great for road running!,
120225,5,07/06/2016,"Even better than the Ghost 8 I was running between 20-25 miles a week in my old Ghost 8s.  My shoes were getting a little too worn so I decided to upgrade to the Ghost 9.  I have been struggling with a sore and stiff knee for several months now.  It wasn't bad enough to keep me from running, but it was making running uncomfortable.  After starting to run in my new Ghost 9s for a few weeks, my knee is finally starting to feel considerably better.  The pain is completely gone, but I do have a little stiffness remaining.  I couldn't believe how much a new shoe could help with my knee problem. Highly recommended",
120225,5,07/05/2016,Love these Its very hard to find a wide and these were awesome. Very comfortable and fit great.,
120225,5,07/05/2016,I would buy this product again ànd again! ,
120225,5,07/04/2016,Love love love this shoe! I have trained in the ghost and recently ran a marathon in the ghost 9. They did not disappoint and like the fit even better than the 8. Lots of cushion and comfortable to wear on long runs!,
120225,5,07/04/2016,The best Brooks yet. ,
120225,5,07/03/2016,"This is a GREAT shoe! After a long bout of plantar fasciitis, this shoe was suggested by a pedorthist.Great shoe for feet that supinate. This new model feels more cushioned and is my Favorite.",
120225,5,07/02/2016,Love my ghosts! My podiatrist recommended the brooks ghost to me.  I love these shoes!  Great support and cushiony comfort.  Highly recommend.,
120225,5,07/01/2016,Incredible shoes These are my first pair of Brooks shoes. I bought these and the Ghost 8's at the same time and I love these ones so much. They are incredibly comfortable.  I have a lot of hip pain and I can get through an entire workout in these without a problem. These are superior to the Ghost 8's by far. I didn't know I could run without pain!,
120225,5,06/28/2016,"Best Ghost yet! I personally love the ghost series (I own the ghost 7, ghost 8, and ghost 9). I run 20-35 miles per week and brooks continues to impress me with the quality. The Ghost 9 is the most cushioned model yet. They feel very natural, yet they are very supportive. The biggest improvement from the 8 to 9 is the natural feel, flexibility, and heel to toe transition. Just when I thought Brooks couldn't get any better, they continue to amaze. These are the best running shoes I have ever owned. I would highly recommend these to anyone. They are totally worth the purchase.",
120225,3,06/21/2016,Too small? I loved the Ghost 6. Perfect fit.  The Ghost 7 and Ghost 8 were not my favorites. They felt too flat and the Ghost 8 had too much overlay over the toe box that rubbed my foot the wrong way.The Ghost 9 is much better than than the 8 with the smooth toe box with no overlay. I was very excited when the Ghost 9 came out. I was disappointed when I tried them on though. I have always been a 9.5 but this pair felt too snug.  My toe was at the end of the shoe and there was not enough room. I'm not sure if they have made them smaller? I am trying the 10 and hope they fit!,
120225,5,06/20/2016,"Brooks Ghost Always a a great shoe! Brooks gave me a pair of the Ghost 9s to test out. First off I have been wearing the Ghosts since the Ghost 2 was available. The Brooks Ghosts are a durable, comfortable shoe that allows you get in  ample miles before needing a replacement pair. One of my favorite things about the Ghost 9 model is the color. I've been waiting for a black shoe color that will look new for longer and go with any outfit. These shoes are very comfortable. I didn't notice many changes from the Ghost 8 (which is also a great shoe). The only downside I can see about this shoe would be that it is a little heavier than some of the other neutral shoes. I tend to use the Brooks Launch of T7 Racer during speed workouts or 5k-10k races because they are a little bit more light-weight then the Ghost.",
120225,4,06/16/2016,"Surprised by the cozy fit ! Was surprised by the overall feel of this style. I have only worn the glycerin 10 I even bought 4 pairs because I didn't like the changes that were made to newer models. I'm a creature of habit and I was rewarded with my wait. This Ghost9 is what I loved about the glycerin 10! The smooth seamless interior, (I have bunions on both feet and seams hurt!)the webbing of the exterior toebox,plenty of room to stretch my toes and most importantly the amazing comfort the second my foot was settled into the shoe. Fits like a glove! My running was my second concern although I was afraid the first mile was going to be a test in patience it seemed I was lost in my run and forgot to worry about my feet! My legs were a bit fatigued but I think running hill intervals had something to do with that. Happy as one can be with the right shoe!",
120225,5,06/15/2016,"Best Ghost Yet I love these shoes, I ran for a year in Ghost 8 and they were good but these are much better. No break in period needed!",
120225,5,06/13/2016,"Excellent upgrade For you die hard Ghost fans this shoe is for you!  I loved the Ghost 7's and bought every color made but when the Ghost 8's came out I was so disappointed in the fit and stiffness in the toe box.  Brooks nailed it with this shoe update!  It has flexible mesh, perfectly cushioned sole, and lighter weight.  I run an average of 20-25 miles per week and was worried I would have to switch my running shoe.  So happy to continue running with the Brooks Ghost.  Thanks!",
120225,5,06/02/2016,I always buy Brooks shoes I walk at least 5 miles every day each week so I need an excellent shoe. Brooks meets all my needs.,
120225,5,05/11/2016,"This isn't just another Ghost 8 The Ghost 9 exceeded my expectations with a sock-like fit even before I laced it up. It feels custom made for my foot. I thought the Ghost 8's were good, but the Ghost 9 are GREAT!",
120226,5,12/12/2017,"actually fits my mid foot I have a very narrow and skinny mid foot and narrow ankles. It is very difficult to keep my feet from sliding foreword so that my toes jam when I run. I also often do not feel stable when shoes are too loose. In boots, I tend to have to put in tongue pads, stuff socks with extra socks or cotton pads to add volume to the mid foot, etc. I have not wanted to take this measure with running shoes, as I think the laces should be able to tighten enough to keep them secure. Unfortunately, this go-round, I had to try at least 20 different styles to find 1 that fit. I tried:Brooks Launch 4 size 10 - too short/wide, toes jammedBrooks Launch 4 size 10.5 - too wide, toes jammedBrooks Levitate 10 - too short/wide, toes jammedBrooks Levitate 10.5 - actually bought and ran in - too wide, toes jammed, upper hurt, ankles hurt, felt like clown shoesBrooks Ghost 10 10.5 - too wide, clown shoesBrooks Ghost 10 10AA - too shortBrooks Ghost 10 10.5AA - still too wide, actually bought and ran in - upper hurt, ankles hurt, toes jammedBrooks Pure Flow 6 10.5 - too wide, toes jammedBrooks Pure Flow 6 10 - too short/wide, toes jammed, did not at all feel the same as my Pure Flow 3's in a size 10. Part of my problem is maybe that I became a forefoot runner after switching to a low heel to toe drop with my Pure Flow 3's (I bought 6 pairs to put off this misery), which I've been running in for 3 years. I think maybe landing on my forefoot makes it harder to keep my foot from sliding foreword. Also, I think my toes extend more. Not sure. All I know is it's very difficult to keep my foot back. While my Pure Flow 3's fit in a size 10, I did have to crank the laces so tight the eyelets touched (just to give you an idea how skinny my foot is). The bands on the side kept my feet back. The Brooks Hyperion fit me securely in a 10.5, but are a bit long. I might even try a 10 and see if I can get away with that because I could use them a little tighter. Still narrow and so light!",
120226,5,12/01/2017,So light weight. ,
120226,4,11/09/2017,"More traction, please!! I use these shoes for workouts and races half-marathon and shorter. The shoes feel great (though the toe box area gets pretty narrow and would be better if it were a bit wider/less tapered).The worst thing about these shoes (and about which many of my training partners have complained) is they are extremely slippery in wet conditions. Brooks is based in Seattle and one would think that would make for those designing the shoes to take into account the importance of traction in wet conditions. It is easily possible to add on small pieces of soft rubber on the bottom that would help give these better traction in wet conditions (the Asics DS Racers back in the very early 2000s did a great job with this). When people are racing (or doing speed workouts), every second counts. Please help make that possible with these shoes by working on the soles so they have better traction. Thanks!",
120226,5,11/01/2017,"Light, comfortable, and get many compliments! ",
120226,1,10/26/2017,I would not ,
120226,5,10/15/2017,"light, comfortable racer This shoe is a great solution for those of us disappointed by the pureconnect discontinuation. It's very light but provides enough support for longer races. I use this shoe for speed work and racing (I use the Launch for long runs). Highly recommend.",
120226,5,10/14/2017,"Light weight with support I was anti-lightweight forever, but the Hyperion offer the support I need in a lightweight package. I travel a lot for work and the lighter weight makes a big difference in my carry on! #ReviewSweeps",
120226,4,10/03/2017,"Nice light, minimal shoe I am not a regular runner these days with kiddos, however love to get out when I can with a good, minimal shoe and have chosen Brooks for the past 7+ years. I used to run in pure cadence shoes I believe and I still really like those, but was recommended to these. They're also nice. VERY minimal feeling and fit close like a sock. Love the color scheme on the Jewel. I think they're a little expensive for how minimal a shoe they are though.",
120226,5,09/24/2017,Happy with the switch I've been running in Brooks adrenaline exclusively in the summer and GTS in winter. I wanted to try a shoe that would not bog me down. This show is light but supportive and has increased my speed without changing anything else!,
120226,1,09/24/2017,uncomfortable ,
120226,5,09/14/2017,LOVE LOVE THESE! ,
120226,5,09/08/2017,Love these shoes! Perfect fit for my narrow feet. For racing and training. Am almost 80 and can't run long distance anymore. May order another pair before they stop making them.,
120226,5,08/03/2017,"Lightweight and perfect! I love these! I need a very lightweight sneaker and this is it! I don't like the feeling of my feet feeling heavy. I workout out about 5-6 days a week and run about 15-20 miles during those workouts and they are comfortable. I did purchase a new pair about 3-4 months in from basic wear but had no problem purchasing knowing the love I have for these. I've reached every PR in them! I have them in the gray color because they feel the most neutral for me and I notice the part where my big toe is, gets like a dark spot in that area on the sneaker almost from like the moisture in sock that bleeds out to the sneaker but really no complaints at all. Feels a little more snug around my foot but again I like to feel secure like that. Love them and  what stands out is the fact that they are REALLY lightweight. Thanks Brooks!",
120226,5,07/23/2017,"Perfect for racing and uptempo training I wear the hyperion for track workouts and uptempo training runs as I'm training for a half and then hopefully full marathon. They're not an everyday trainer—I don't typically warm up in them even—but they're great for running fast and do well on the track (and cushion your legs enough for long workouts). I haven't raced in them, but I look forward to it. I should add that I'm a smaller runner and prefer lightweight shoes, so they might not be right if you're bigger and need more support. Also, I have pretty narrow feet and love how glovelike these feel, so other reviewers are probably right in saying they're narrow, but for me, they're perfect, and I hope they never change!",
120226,2,06/13/2017,"Absolutely No Arch Support Bought this as a nice race flat and track day shoe. First day I put them on, they were a smidge tight which I actually appreciated so they'd stay closer to my foot. HOWEVER, there was no arch support whatsoever - despite the shoe being recommended for people with high arches. I have never had plantar fascia pain until after my track workout. It tore my foot up...Would probably love them if I could fit my foot into them with a good orthotic.",
120226,5,05/16/2017,Very Lightweight I've been using these shoes for about 2 weeks now. So far they seem very good.,
120226,5,04/20/2017,"LOVE this shoe but it's not good for off-road/track Love the fit, weight (so light), comfort & overall wear of this shoe!  But...  I train on a very rocky circular driveway, and the deep, sponge-like soles  only serve to pick up a lot of rocks which can then be felt in the bottoms of my feet as I run.  Really do wish I could train in them but will be keeping them for races on paved surfaces instead.  Still giving 5 stars because I knew this might be a problem for me at time of purchase.",
120226,5,04/07/2017,"My NEW Go To trainer Great for for my mid distance to marathon training. Light weight yet durable, a replacement for my discontinued favorite T7's. Toe box is slightly narrow but overall true to size. Great laces, never come undone during my run.Would love to see these in more colors in the future!",
120226,2,03/18/2017,Narrow fit ,
120226,1,03/13/2017,"uncomfortable SIze was a true fit based on my past brooks purchases.  I've been treadmill running for 4 years, 15-20 mi/week, started out in brooks pure series, then when the styles changed, I switched brands.I like a very lightweight shoe, helps keep my shin splints from flaring up, so when I saw how lightweight the hyperion were, I thought I'd give them a try.  With any new shoe, I start out using for the first 2-3 miles, then switch to a broken in shoe, and do this for a week or so.Unfortunately, these are still very uncomfortable in the area beneath the first inside lace hole on both shoes, which actually feels very stiff and rubbed my foot enough that it caused a slight blister.  The span between the first set of lace holes closest to the toe of the shoe, does not seem to have any give at all, and it's very stiff on the inside of the shoe.  Disappointed that I spent the money and can't wear to run or walk in",
120226,5,03/09/2017,"I would recommend this shoe to friends I did have to order a half size bigger. They fit pretty tight but I enjoy the support. Arch support is very good, I have more of a flat arch so it gives me stability, but if you have a higher arch I think it would give you the support you need as well.",
120226,5,03/08/2017,"So worth the price I run on a treadmill five days a week with these shoes. When I started that routine I was wearing Nikes, but got sore knees and shin splints. With better technique and these running shoes, my pain is GONE! Worth every penny.",
120226,4,01/13/2017,"weightless fast shoe I first tried breaking these shoes by walking to find that they were really weightless. I felt light on my feet. I was worried about them fitting too narrow since my foot is a little wider and slightly higher arched, but they fit like a glove except that I'm slightly aware of the seams coming together where the tongue and body of the shoe connect, but only on the left foot (weird). Other than that I have not gotten one blister from them. Theyre my new favorite track shoes.",
120226,2,01/13/2017,"Way too Tight These shoes looked great right out the box. They were really light which was a plus. Once I began to run in them, the pain came and it didn't end. I thought if I kept running in them for a while it would loosen up and feel better, but it never did. I ended up getting blisters in places I've never had them before on my feet. It was probably the most painful running show I had ever wore. I will say that it was a stable shoe and I didn't have pain elsewhere.",
120226,1,11/16/2016,"Trying to stick with brooks ....but it isn't working I bought these to replace a pair of PureConnects that I wore out since they don't make the PureConnects any more. I had to send these back. They were probably close to the right length but so tight across my foot. It was impossible to get comfortable and might've made my feet go numb. I have very average size 8.5 feet, like to run about 6 miles on an average run, and wear a super light weight shoe. These were so close but a miss. I am so sad that I have had to look else where for running shoes. Please bring back the split sole, 12mm drop Pure Connect shoe!",
120226,5,10/10/2016,Two thumbs up These shoes have quickly become my go-to for all speed and cross training workouts. They are light weight but supportive. I have a narrow foot and love the way these hug my feet!,
120226,2,09/28/2016,":( :( :( They are stinkin' gorgeous, but they chewed me up. The seams where the bottom lace hole and tongue all seem to come together rubs really bad and after a three mile run, I was left with big blisters on the tops of both of my feet.",
120226,5,09/28/2016,"BEST SHOES At first, I thought Brooks forgot to pack the shoes in the box because the box was SO LIGHT. I love these shoes. I put them on and feel as if they become my feet. I have taken them on runs up to 6 miles and I have no issues with knee or hip pain. I will be buying more of these shoes.",

120226,5,08/25/2016,"Love them! After many years of marathon training, I decided it was time to get a lightweight shoe for speed workouts on the road and on the track. Having been a longtime Glycerin wearer, I knew I liked Brooks and was sure of my size. Honestly, I could not be happier with the Hyperion. It is only my second week using them for tempo runs, progression runs, and intervals and I am already sure they were an awesome purchase.",
120227,4,12/18/2017,Why did I wait so long The fit is great right out of the box . Comfortable shoe and great on the trails.I liked them so much I got a pair for my neice ... The only negative was the initial price .. My feet are of different sizes so it can get expensive getting 2 sets of shoes ... So I waited for the price to come down ... Really happy w my purchase .,
120227,5,12/08/2017,My favorite shoes of all time! I've been running competitively for about 20 years and these are my favorite shoes to-date. They're light and fit like a glove. They're a great day-to-day trainer and also suitable for racing. I'm on my second pair and bought a third when I wasn't sure Brooks would continue to produce this shoe. Very happy with the Mazama!,
120227,4,11/26/2017,"So far so good This is my second attempt at Brooks trail shoes and they are doing good so far. They are a little tighter in the toe box and wish they had a wider width. But they grip really good on the trails. As long as they hold up, I will buy them again when these wear out.",
120227,5,10/17/2017,"Great shoe! I have loved these shoes so far. They are lightweight, a snug fit, and have great grip. I haven't had any hot spots or blisters from them and that was something I had been struggling with from some other brands of trail shoes before this. Happy with my purchase!",
120227,5,09/25/2017,"A win! You know, I love this shoe! I take racing very seriously and needed a new pair of ""grippy"" yet fast and light trail shoes for an international race. I had worn out a previous pair of Mazamas so decided to give them a whirl again. They did not disappoint!! The race course included some paved stretches, upon which this shoe was also fine – it really shined on a technical, steep incline toward the finish...in fact, I was able to pass other runners, due to the confidence I had from knowing that my shoe was dynamite. I highly recommend this one, as it's the only pair of trail speed shoes that I would entrust my race to! (don't be dismayed if they feel funny on your foot the first time or two...this happened to me both times I bought this shoe, but that quickly transfers to a dream training/race shoe that hugs your foot nicely) Their bright color is super-fun, too. Thanks Brooks!",
120227,5,09/15/2017,"Great trail shoe Overall a great shoe. Lots of grip and feels a little springy! My forefoot foot is on the wider side of average, and I do agree with the other reviewer who said these run a bit narrow. However, I found that changing how I lace them made them perfectly comfortable (google wide foot shoe lacing pattern)",
120227,5,07/19/2017,"Not for wide feet I love this shoe, but it is does not fit the shape of my very wide foot, so I returned it😔",

120227,5,07/04/2017,"Loving these shoes! I'm really enjoying these shoes.  They are light.  The upper is very comfortable.  I've done technical trails with them and the grip is great.  I normally wear Cascadias, so it has taken a bit to adjust to the lower drop, but I think it will be good.  The longest run in the them so far was over 5 hours and I had no hot spots.  That included two creek crossings.  The water drained out of the shoe well too!",
120227,5,07/01/2017,Love these shoes! I've been a Brook's fan for a while now. These shoes definitely don't disappoint!,
120227,5,06/25/2017,"Nice and snug Wow!  I love these shoes -- although not a true trail runner, I purchased these because I wanted a lower heel base (and I love the colors)!!! The first day I wore them, my heel ached a little and I chalked that up to the lower heel base I mentioned earlier. The second time I wore them, I just truly fell in love -- my muscles had stretched and adapted that I forgot I had them one. The responsiveness of the shoe when running is quite amazing. The shoes are very snug - even with thin socks. I love the support and the fact there is not a lot of play where your foot is sliding within the shoe.  I normally where a size 10 and ordered these in a size 10.5. Perfect fit especially in the toebox.",
120227,2,06/19/2017,"Not comfortable Love the theory behind the design and the lightweight feel of this shoe.  However, it was just too narrow and uncomfortable to even take for that first run.  This is the first pair of Brooks that failed to feel comfortable right out of the box out of years of running in them.",
120227,5,05/09/2017,"90 Day / 246 Mile Review from a Dirt Road and Trail Runner I was hesitant at first, given that I couldn't try them on at any of our local running stores.  I called Brooks customer service line and was promptly connected an actual human who, much to my surprise, actually runs in both the Mazamas and the Cascadias, which I was transitioning from.  How cool is that?!  Her feedback coupled with the 90 day trial period sold me, and I'm so very glad it did.Right out of the box, I couldn't believe how light they are and how superior the grip is.  It is truly aggressive.  I'm a big fan of the Diva Pink combo and overall design of the shoe.  I'm an even bigger fan of zero heel slip, zero lace slip, foot protection from raised rocks on our gravel roads, and the grip in front when trail racing up hills.  I had planned to alternate these for every other run for a week or two, but they are so light that I couldn't look back.  The blisters I expected never came.  The fit is like a glove.  My everyday shoes are 8.5.  I take a 9.5 in Cascadia and Launch, but a 9 in these.  They feel more streamlined to my foot than any other running shoe that I have tried.  Ever.  The airy material leaves my feet feeling dry and cool after hours of running.They are holding up well.  I am starting to feel the rocks more at this point, so will be switching these out in a month or so.  I was hoping they would make it to 400 miles, but nothing really lasts out here, so this comes as no surprise.  Perhaps they will surprise me.  That being said, I'm still very happy I made the investment.I was so impressed with these that I switched my paved road/treadmill shoes to Brooks as well.  Those miles are now done in the Launch.",
120227,5,04/24/2017,"I searched for over 6 months I really wanted some lightweight trail runners for day hikes. I'm not much of an actual trail runner, but I hike many weekends during the summer. I wanted an alternative to my heavy duty hiking boots. The one downside is they are not great in rain. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.",
120227,5,03/15/2017,Excellent grip!! ,
120230,2,12/03/2017,Way too narrow! ,
120230,1,10/22/2017,"Terrible, Nothing like the original Pure Grit #ReviewSweeps ",
120230,5,10/19/2017,I have bought this product again I walk my 80lb German shepherd mix every weekday and these shoes are fabulous.  They have great traction and are comfortable from the first time i put them on.  Of course i have been wearing Beooks shoes for a few years and not a single pair has ever given me a problem.,
120230,5,09/29/2017,Mountain Running Shoes ,
120230,3,09/10/2017,I wanted to like these I am training for a 50 miler on dirt and crushed limestone trails. I really wanted to like these shoes but the tongue was uncomfortable and I began developing sores on the top of both of my feet and had to return them after a couple months. It is great that Brooks stands behind their product and still allowed for a return but I wish these shoes were more comfortable and I didn't have to take advange of this feature.,
120230,4,09/04/2017,My first pair of trail runners and they are wonderful! Cannot wait to run my fall 8k and 10k with my Brooks! I have always had great luck with this brand!,
120230,5,08/28/2017,"This is my 4th pair My 4th pair.  I continue to Like the color, style, sole. Cushion goodTonge is different -a bit short and a bit stiff.  Shoe strings are too short",
120230,5,06/27/2017,Great Trail runner! ,
120230,3,06/24/2017,"Love, but too narrow. I love the look of these shoes and how good the soles feel, but they are way too narrow for my foot.  This is strange because I have a narrow foot so I figured ordering a B width would fit fine with a sock.  It did not...way too narrow even for my slender foot.",
120230,4,06/24/2017,"This is a narrow show and I have narrow feet! I love the look of this shoe and the way the sole feels, but it is narrow.  I have narrow feet and it is narrow even on my foot.  I am hoping it will stretch out some after it is worn.",
120230,4,06/18/2017,Light but Tight Love the stability and light weight but they are tight across the top of my foot.  I've never had this problem with Brooks shoes but these are the first trail shoes I have ordered.  Hoping they will stretch out.,
120230,1,04/22/2017,Not like previous models I have worn the puregrit for 3 years and several models and LOVED them. But the new model has a new lacing structure that hits on the top of my foot. No amount of relacing  made them comfortable. So sad that brooks might have lost me as a customer.,
120230,2,04/06/2017,"Very Disappointed I purchased these shoes because I've been wearing previous models for several years without any problems. Unfortunately, I had nothing but problems with this shoe. I was running a 44 trail run and ended up injured. The shoes has a new plastic design on the top of the shoe that made them painful to wear! I had to re-lace my shoes three different times just to try to make them comfortable. This caused me to get several blisters. I also injured myself because the shoe was not supporting my feet properly after I re-laced them. Buying these shoes cost me months of being unable to run.",
120230,1,04/04/2017,I am unhappy with my purchase This was my first pair of brooks shoes. I am extremely unhappy with them for the price I paid and high expectations I had! I can't even wear them now to run or walk because the insole lining has come up in the toe area. Not sure what to do since I've only wornanoyr 2 dozen times and I don't want to go spend more money on a new pair when I just ordered these.,
120230,5,03/29/2017,I love these shoes! ,
120230,2,03/08/2017,"OUCH I own the same shoes, previous model, that I love. I ordered these online, but the new laces hit my metatarsal and hurt. The shoes have an added vinyl piece that presses the lace into my foot. Have tried relacing them several times, but they still are uncomfortable. What was wrong with laces uncovered?",
120230,2,02/22/2017,"Aesthetics, quality, fit all unappealing I loved the previous Grit model but can't find it in my size anywhere. I assumed it would continue to be available. This one looks like an orthopedic shoe - I found it very unattractive, didn't like the lace-up situation, it was wide on my foot (and lacing and tongue-less set-up doesn't lend itself to fixing). Really wanted to like this shoe but it bears no resemblance to the awesome earlier version. The shiny material touches looked cheap and didn't like the color that much either.",
120230,4,11/29/2016,"Great for Hiking and Trail Running I bought these because I love the PureFlow line (3 and 4 at least) and needed a good shoe for hiking and trail running that was light but had good traction so I don't slip - this shoe does the job! I especially like the firm layer around the bottom of the shoe (between the sole and the mesh) since when you're on a trail the rocks will typically tear that area and in this case that protects them really well and I think it'll make these last longer.So for con's, though I didn't select poor traction above because it's decent, I just wish it had a tiny bit more. Also, I wear orthotic's and they make the shoe's squeak a bit since they are slightly wider than the shoe. More an annoyance than anything though since they still work with them.",
120230,5,11/26/2016,"This IS a great shoe... I have the predecessor of Pure Grit (basically a different color) and I've run in these at least once a week for the past 8 months. They are very durable, as most Brooks shoes are, and they have a good arch and great tread. I've never had a pair of Brooks shoes wear out on me or tear/fade, etc., and I've had a LOT of Brooks shoes over my 5 years of running. I've seen this shoe in my local running store and it's SO pretty!! I would love this pair, but the Pure Grit I have will probably last another year!",
120230,2,08/18/2016,"Ugg run away I have only used these shoes for walking my dog and I have had them for one month.  The mesh is already separating from the shoe similar to what happened with last years model. and the wear on them is terrible. I was hoping to begin wearing them for running and was just making sure they were broke in properly before doing so   Last years model had excellent support but did not hold up well, this years seems to be holding together longer but the support just isn't comparable and they are already falling apart.",
120231,5,12/27/2017,"Good as ever I started running in Asics, but was never comfortable in my run. After I tried a pair of adrenalines, I never went back. They have the right support with a cushiony ride, full heel cup, and spacious toebox. I never get blisters and breaking them in is a foreign concept to me. The sole molds to my arch over time. This is my favorite trainer of all time.",
120231,5,12/27/2017,I would buy this product again!! I am on my 4th pair of Brooks Adrenaline and I must say I love them.  Comfort is top notch.  My only wish is that they had more fun colors.  I'm 38 but I still want to wear fun looking shoes not colors for older gals.,
120231,4,12/26/2017,Good running shoe Love the color and general comfort when running. Wished it had been available in a narrow width.,

120231,5,12/20/2017,This is my forever shoe I have suffered with planters fasciitis for over a year trying several different brands of shoes drs appointments and several other things. Within 3 days of wearing these shoes my heel is almost better! Love these shoes!!,
120231,4,12/20/2017,"great shoes I'm an avid hiker, but have never liked the feel of hiking boots or heavy duty hiking shoes.. I bought my first pair of Brooks over a year ago and got over 200 miles of rough terrain on them before deciding to get another pair. I went ahead and got the GTS 17 this go round and am very pleased with them so far. I hiked ~25 miles on various terrain in Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks a few weeks ago and was very impressed with the grip and durability of these shoes.. I will continue to purchase Brooks shoes...",

I did notice the new adrenaline18 does not have the solid rubber toe lip, bummer..a must when walking on dirt. I won't be buying that model.",
120231,5,12/19/2017,"Will never buy a different shoe for marathons ever again! Though it gave me slightly blistering, (due to my not breaking them in proper) the feel great and allow me to run long distance with no pain.",
120231,5,12/18/2017,Great Cushion! I love the forefoot cushioning- improved over the Ravenna which I was wearing.  Great shoe!,
120231,5,12/18/2017,"The cushion I needed After getting sidelined with hip issues after my last half, this shoe has been part of what's allowed me to get back on the road running again.",
120231,5,12/18/2017,"I'm always for Brooks Adrenalines. They're just the right ones for my feet.  Since they were introduced to me years ago, I never went back.",
120231,5,12/18/2017,I love this shoe I have a low ankle bone. These shoes fit my low bone well without rubbing. It's cushioning helps the joints.,
120231,4,12/17/2017,Very happy! I wasn't sure how much I would like these since I always wear the Ghost.   I'm happy I decided to give them a try.,
120231,5,12/17/2017,The best These are my favorite shoes! Great support and cushion at reasonable price! Love them,
120231,2,12/16/2017,"Not the right shoe for me This shoe felt like my heel was tilted up, so it was not comfortable for me. The shoe looked nice and felt true to size, just not the right structure for my particular physiology.",
120231,5,12/16/2017,"Excellent comfort and fit. Energizes my legs for endurance. I use these shoes to work out, hike, and work in. My feet never get tired, and my legs feel supported all day. I have much more endurance on hikes. They have great traction, and room for my bunion. They work perfectly with my orthodics.",
120231,2,12/16/2017,Minimal cushion and feels stiff. Feels like I am running barefoot. I've noticed an increase in knee and back pain since I switched to these.,
120231,5,12/15/2017,"Amazing shoes!!! I used to have pains in my lowerback, hips, knees, legs, and feet while running after I passed +10k distance. Doc told me I was having plantar fasciitis and posterior tibial tendonitis, and I would need a week or two ""rest time"" in order to run again, A friend who is also a long-distant runner, recommended Brooks, and I completed the questionnaire and got Adrenaline GTS 17. I wore and went out for running 13K, and it was amazing! This shoes support the entire feet by hugging them firmly and keeping them in place - it is like the shoes correct my form, and with the correct form I do not have those from-lower-back-to-sole pains. I could go running on the very next day without any pains or fatigue. Even I did not feel muscle sores - running felt very easy. The sole cushion is strong and firm to support my feet during the running on the paved roads in the city. They aren't super-soft cushy-comfy but rather very dependable and high-performance shoes that you can count on. I have increased my running regimen since I started wearing these shoes. And I do not have pain issues and continue to better my time.    Thank you Brooks!!!",
120231,5,12/14/2017,"On my 2nd pair of these and have another 3rd in my closet! I hike the Grand Canyon in my first pair, and then ran hundreds of miles. My 2nd pair already has close to a hundred miles and is doing great! Highly recommend these!",

120231,5,12/14/2017,Excellent for Pronation ,
120231,4,12/13/2017,A REAL WALKING SHOE I purchased this shoe for power walking.  I have RA in my toes and a running shoe does not provide any support or comfort.  This shoe definitely provides that support. It has been very difficult to find a walking shoe that is not either black or white and look like an orthotic elderly shoe.  I am very happy with the style.I was disappointed that almost all of the colors that are supposedly available were never available for purchase in my size or width.  I searched for a long time (6 months to a year).  I settled on a color and would prefer a wider size.,
120231,2,12/12/2017,"Runs small Ordered 1/2 size larger than my normal, but they were too small. Had to return. Will need to go a full size larger next time.",
120231,5,12/11/2017,"Awesome running shoe I run 5 days a week on a treadmill. I am flat footed and usually have a lot of hip and knee when running. This shoe allows me to run without any pain. Fits perfect and looks great. I normally have to wear men's shoes because women's don't come large enough, but I was able to wear women's size 12 in this shoe.",
120231,5,12/10/2017,"Love these shoes My first pair of Brooks, they won't be the last! They are very comfortable! I have worn them almost every day for two weeks. I have no complaints.",

120231,5,12/10/2017,"LOVE I use this smaller size to life weights. I am very flat feet and I notice that I don't have the same pain in knee, feet. It is very stable and helps me not pronate during weight bearing excercises.",

Immediately comfortable. I am sure I have a new favorite.  I have been running in these for about a month and they are holding up perfectly plus  they feel so good.  I feel like they give proper support for my over pronation. The color great too because it goes with everything.  I Love them!",
120231,3,12/07/2017,Not very comfortable I've had a few pairs of Ghost and loved those. Have developed plantar fasciitis I wanted to try something new with more support. These shoes feel narrow across the toes and even using some different inserts they feel hard and uncomfortable.  I would continue to recommend brooks to anyone that asked but I personally won't buy this style again.,
120231,5,12/07/2017,"Love this Shoe! I wear this shoe from morning until night everyday, around the house, out to shop and for my workout sessions. I add my own OTC orthotic and it is just a great shoe. I see they are changing the shoe design for next year and hope it will work as well.",
120231,5,12/06/2017,"Good running shoes These have been my running shoes for years now. I started with the Adrenaline GTS 13's, and now I'm on the 17's (although I skipped over the 16's because I bought multiple pairs of the 15's). I have to put my own arch supports in them, because the ones they come with don't work for me, but then again I have to put my own arch supports in every shoe that I wear and have had to do that for years. These shoes have good heal support which is good for someone like me who suffers from planter fasciitis. I ran my first 10K, my first half marathon, and my first marathon in these shoes over the course of the last 2.5 years, and I don't plan on switching any time soon!",
120231,4,12/06/2017,yes I need the most supportive sneaker possible. This is my second pair and so far so good. I am on my feet all day but do not run.,
120231,3,12/05/2017,"My feet have matured! lol Oh how I waited with great anticipation for these marvelous shoes to be delivered, only to find out when they arrived that they are not for me. They're just a bit too snug and a bit shorter in length than I need.  And now they're out of stock in my fav color in the wider width that I may need. I don't like the colors of the Adrenaline GTS 2018, so now contemplating what shall I do??",
120231,5,12/05/2017,The best! These are a great all around shoe. Switched from Asics and am so glad I did. Comfortable on both pavement and cross country courses. Great training shoe!,

120231,2,12/04/2017,"Loved the old model, this one made my feet hurt. I needed to replace my Adrenaline GTS 16's and bought this shoe. At first I felt like they were great - but after standing (which I do a lot for work, I'm a camerawoman) for just like 45 minutes the first day my feet were TIRED. I wore the shoes for another month and I still had the same issue. This did not happen with the previous year's model.Not sure what changed. I had to send these ones back. I was very disappointed because I love my old Brooks - I hope they decide to bring back whatever worked in the old design.",
120231,5,12/04/2017,I Love them! ,
120231,5,12/04/2017,"Great support and very comfortable! I have struggled to find a pair of not just running shoes, but shoes to give me the support while working out. These shoes are fantastic and I no longer have the ankle pain I once had after running!",
120231,1,12/04/2017,Not true to their word regarding returns. Extremely stiff and no cushioning:(  Didn't even have to run as I knew they would no work.  Shipped right back unworn and am still 30 days later waiting for a refund.  Definitely would not ever order here again.,
120231,5,12/04/2017,same great shoe I have used brooks for over 15 years now and was an avid runner in high school and college. These were the only shoes that gave me enough support and comfort that I could run the long distances. I have always worn the Adrenaline series. I fear that my feet have changed with my body now that I work in a hospital (on feet all day) and have switched from running to an athletic boot camp. The shoes are of no fault: still great support and comfort and design. I fear I might need something with even more arch support now. Looking forward to my next great shoe adventure in a new pair of brooks.,
120231,5,12/04/2017,"Brooks fan Totally love to ware Brooks, I can use my custom orthotics without any problem. Brooks has the best warranty and stand behind their product, offer free return. I am big fan and will always own a pair or two🙂",

I am a big walker now after years of running all with my Brooks Shoes, thank you.",
120231,5,12/02/2017,It's my favorite shoe for pronation This addition added a toe guard where previous years my big toe created a tiny hole through the shoe,
120231,5,12/02/2017,Very comfortable from sun up to sundown! I ordered 1/2 size bigger than usual. I tend to need a slightly larger  toe bed and the regular width fit great.,
120231,5,12/01/2017,like the sneaker ,
120231,5,12/01/2017,I would definitely purchase this product again ,
120231,4,12/01/2017,"Love this shoe. Buy a new pair every year. I slightly over pronate and this shoe has been perfect for me and is the only one I wear. I moved to Thailand a little while ago, and have visitors from the US bring me new pairs since I can't part with them! It has the perfect amount of cushioning and support for me for a good price. The most recent pair seems a little bigger than the last ones I bought in the same size, but that could also be a due to how tightly I have them laced.",
120231,3,11/30/2017,I may buy this product again. The width around the ankle feels a bit too loose. My socks slowly slip down to almost off the heel. Then size of shoe 9.5 fits fine.,
120231,4,11/30/2017,"Yes, I would buy this product again. I love my Brooks shoes! I have brought Brooks running shoes for a while now. I love the fit, color & styles that I have selected. I've received numerous compliments and I am quick to share the Brooks brand information!!",

120231,4,11/28/2017,"Brooks Ladies Adrenaline GTS17 Doesn't Disappoint Am a 62 year old female with low back issues and this shoe is a life saver.  Have bought previous Brooks Adrenline shoes also and loved them as well.  This shoe does run small.  I usually wear a size 8.5 but did order the  size 9 and it just barely fits, so go bigger when ordering.  It is actually somewhere between and half size to a full size smaller than expected.   Width size is good (medium) and they  have plenty of wiggle room for toes.  Very comfortable out of the box.  Not a runner, but I do walk for cardio/general health, and I wouldn't leave the house without these Adrenalines on. In fact, I own several pairs in different colors and wear them almost constantly.  These shoes are lightweight/breathable and you can wear them all day long without any discomfort or sweat/odor.  A little pricey, but I wait and catch them on sale.  GTS really means Go To Shoe, in my case anyhow.",

The laces are much more secure and the reinforced toe area will prevent my toe from wearing through the sneaker, which happened with my previous pair after a very short time owning them. I prefer the tighter weave of the sneaker as well as opposed to the more porous style of my previous version, likely also a contributing factor of the hole I wore through the toe.",
120231,3,11/25/2017,Sticking with the Glycerin Too stiff. Purchased for the extra width but definitely not for me. My feet hurt after my long run. Returned and purchased another pair of Glycerin's instead.,
120231,4,11/25/2017,"Great padding! Great shoe I bought 10.5W since most shoes are too narrow for my feet and my feet have changed as I've gotten older (as they say feet do). these shoes still feel a bit tight on top of my feet, I have loosened the strings as much as possible before they feel too loose for the short sprints I do. My socks are thin. They have incredible padding.",
120231,5,11/24/2017,Love love love them! ,
120231,5,11/24/2017,Comfortable shoes! ,
120231,5,11/22/2017,"Perfect fit This shoe is perfect in comfort, fit,, stability and not too flexible as I have hallux rigidus. It's very hard to find a shoe that works for me. I'm a walker and just enough flex to rock my toe allowing me comfort to continue walking 3 miles a day. I wear an 8; ordered 8 1/2, I knew these ran short.",
120231,5,11/22/2017,Recommended by my doctor ,
120231,5,11/22/2017,My Forever Shoe I've gotten these shoes for over 8 years and plan to continue doing the same!,
120231,5,11/22/2017,"Best Running Shoes!! I always had issues with shin splints after running regularly, 4 days a week. Once I got these, they totally went away! Perfect support and super comfortable!",
120231,4,11/21/2017,"Great Shoe This shoe has been great! When I run uphill, I feel like I have an extra spring with these on. My only complaint is they were a little slippery on some wet ground, but most tennis shoes are. Very happy with these!",
120231,5,11/21/2017,"Brooks Adrenaline never let me down I've been buying Brooks Adrenaline since 2010.  I try on different shoes, seeing if something new would work, and I always go back to the tried and true Brooks Adrenaline.  I get so many miles out of this, and my legs don't go numb or have shin splints, like I do with other running shoes.  These shoes make the quality of my runs 1000% better!",
120231,4,11/21/2017,"Very pleased, cautiously optimistic I enjoy these shoes and actually bought another pair because the first pair I bought this year had the sole start ungluing about 2 months after purchase.  I never had this problem before (multiple pairs over the years were just fine and performed well) and feel like it was probably a fluke and not the norm.   I continue to enjoy my shoes and hope a problem does not develope again.",
120231,4,11/21/2017,Solid and dependable Really like these shoes! Comfortable right out of the box. Will try narrow size option next time.,
120231,5,11/21/2017,"I buy this shoe every 4 month or so - LOVE GTS! I have knee and feet problems and this shoe keeps me running (along with proper training, etc) - love the fits, the looks/saturation of colors, etc!",
120231,4,11/20/2017,Liked my last pair better ,
120231,5,11/20/2017,I buy this shoe every year. ❤️❤️❤️ I'm getting back into running after a lower back injury.  These shoes are lightweight and super comfortable.  I switched out the soles for super feet for extra support for my back and I wear them every day.  Love them!,
120231,5,11/20/2017,Love these shoes!! I run and go to boot camp about 5 days a week and these shoes are perfect for that. This is my 4th pair of Adrenalines- I'm hooked!,
120231,5,11/19/2017,Just ran a 5K and not the first sign of foot pain! ,
120231,5,11/19/2017,"Consistant Quality Third pair of GTS in last 3 years, I keep buying them because they feel great and keep my natural tendency to pronate from hurting my knees! I could not run the miles I run without this wonderful shoe. I tried a neutral shoe once, and quickly retired them to lawn mowing shoes! I went back to the GTS and have never regretted it! I was brave enough to order online, because I can count on the consistent quality!",
120231,5,11/19/2017,"Best looking shoe ever When I said true to size I need to elaborate.   They are a perfect BROOKS size 10. Having bought probably ten pairs at least of the Brooks shoes over the years I have learned to ask for this size.  ALL of my other shoes (mostly Finn Comfort, some NAOT and occasional Rockport are either 39 or 8M.    I have running shoes mostly at Pacers and sometimes other stores.  No salesperson has ever believed when I said I wanted size 10 but that is the case for Brooks.   I wonder if other customers experience this anomaly.   Now days I almost exclusively buy all my shoes on line so I am glad I know what sizes go with what brands.",
120231,2,11/19/2017,"Not designed Well This shoe is designed for show not for running. The heal material is to slick and makes your heal slip. The laces are also to slippery, you have to constantly retie your shoes. The laces also have heavy caps, and when your running they clink on the sides of your shoes. Super annoying when your running at the gym. I always buy the adrenaline and this style was the worst.",
120231,5,11/19/2017,Comfort in style I love the bright colors and how comfortable these shoes are. I could feel a difference after adding my orthotics in these shoes.,
120231,5,11/19/2017,Great mid-stability running shoe! Was having pain starting after running 5 miles and these shoes correct the issues I was having and allows me to run farther.,
120231,5,11/18/2017,"Great shoes!!! I was hesitant to order these as I have been fighting an Achilles' tendon injury this year and I just couldn't find shoes that didn't hurt. I'd heard so many good things about them so decided to give them a try. While I'm not up to my 4 miles yet, they provided the support and comfort to get me back in the game. Yay brooks!!!",
120231,5,11/18/2017,"Love 💕 them! I needed a sneaker that has a ton of support because I have had 8 surgeries on my left foot. These sneakers are the only ones I can wear all day without my foot, hip and back killing me by the end of my day! Please don't ever change these sneakers! I will buy them forever!",
120231,3,11/17/2017,Settled You shouldn't have changed the addiction because the new 13 is terrible& now I have to settle for adrenaline;(,
120231,5,11/16/2017,"I would definitely buy these shoes again , they rock ! They are very supportive without looking like overbuilt shoes . I love the slim line and color combination . Price was great and freed me up to buy another pair so I can switch them for longer lasting use",
120231,5,11/16/2017,My go to running shoe I have been wearing Brooks Adrenaline running shoes for over 7 years now.  Still works best for my runs which are mostly done on a dirt/gravel roads.,
120231,2,11/16/2017,"Not comfortable Dissapointed , I usually buy Asics but wanted to give Brooks a try.  After 10minutes of running with these shoes I had to stop and put on my old Asics.  They hurt my entire foot and ankle.",
120231,5,11/15/2017,Love...love..love...these sneakers!! ,
120231,4,11/14/2017,"Provides the support I need I am breaking them in and was at first suprised that they seemed smaller (1/2 to 1 size) than my previous two pairs of Ghosts.  However, once laced with Nathan's lock laces the fit seemed much better. Being an older runner, I have less balance on my non-dominate leg/ankle.  I hope over time I get the support I am looking for.  By April and after training for Boston, I should know!",
120231,5,11/14/2017,"Comfort, Support & Reliable Running Shoe ",
120231,5,11/14/2017,"Love my gts 17's I loved adrenalines (new at the 17's) so much I bought a second pair !   I saw the 18's in a store and they just dont work well for me (rub little toe and front of shoe feels less somehow) worried me what to do when my 17's wore out so I opted to purchase a second pair on the brooks site at sale price.  I have plantar f and ankle tendon issues and heel spurs.  I suppinate but these are what works best for me really great in fact took ankle pain away.  I alternate with ghosts in house. These shoes have honestly solved my foot pain, I was a mess when i wore my old saucony brands to death and my feet were sustaining damage from the age of the shoe and prob' wrong style.   I could not find any that helped the pain as I was trying to stay way below 100 bucks.  Finally I tried brooks and am so glad I did my ghosts and adrenalines have solved my problem.   I am however concerned with the new change to these I hope by the time I need new ones they a re back to this support and cushion level.  DONT be afraid to try color contrast, Im over 50 and bought the all light blue first time and this time decided to try some color contrast.  Well it actually makes me feel sorta styling and cute LOL.  And Im not really that type usually.  But with age Im feeling out place and these help a tad to feel more youthful as far a style.",
120231,5,11/14/2017,My favorite shoes! Great shoes! I have chronic Achilles tendinitis and these help relieve the pain.,
120231,5,11/12/2017,"I AM buying this product again I actually use these shoes for my dog agility and flyball training and shows. Being an over-pronator now, these shoes have great balance and do not put unnecessary stress on my hips, knees and back. Fantastic shoe find. I WILL be purchasing another pair.",
120231,5,11/10/2017,Love love love ,
120231,5,11/10/2017,"Love, Love, Love these shoes.  Will buy them again. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had and I am 69 years old.  I just do a lot of walking and I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes have helped a lot with the pain.",
120231,5,11/09/2017,Comfortable! ,
120231,4,11/09/2017,Supports is wonderful Bought this shoe with referral from therapist for relief of planter fasciitis to provide support.  It's doing great in relieving some of that pain.  My only setback is that my feet sweat more than usual.,
120231,3,11/09/2017,A little tight ,
120231,5,11/09/2017,Great support I pronate and have been having pain in my foot.  These give me the support I need and I no longer have pain.  I have very wide feet and this is the first pair a sneaker that give me the room I need.  They are a perfect fit!,
120231,2,11/09/2017,not sure if i would buy again love the look of the shoeshoes are not very comfortable when walking long distances,
120231,5,11/09/2017,Love my new Adrenaline GTS 17 running shoes! I walk 5 days a week for at least a half hour and workout another 45 minutes and these shoes are extremely comfortable!  I have very bad feet and these work well for me!,
120231,5,11/08/2017,"Great, lightweight, comfy shoe Love this shoe, I tried another shoe, and had to return it, because it was not comfortable... too narrow. I returned for this shoe!",
120231,5,11/08/2017,like the shooes.  Would like thought to have them in white ,
120231,4,11/08/2017,"Brooks are the bomb! I Jazzercise 4 times a week and run once a week.  These shoes have great stability and provide great support!  This is my first pair of Adrenalines.  They are just a touch smaller in length than the Brooks, but not enough to go up a half size.  I have found my forever shoe!",
120231,5,11/08/2017,Yes i would buy again in a heartbeat! ,
120231,5,11/07/2017,The only shoe I need ,
120231,5,11/07/2017,Awesome! These shoes were so comfortable. I was leaving on a trip and took a gamble ordering these last minute and these gym shoes for perfectly. We went hiking and walking and they were so supportive and have a comfortable toe box.,
120231,4,11/07/2017,"Very comfortable, but squeaking! I have owned this style before and had great success.  This pair, however, squeaks!  This does not affect comfort, but is a bit annoying as I walk very early in the morning for the peace and quiet!",
120231,5,11/07/2017,Great product! ,
120231,5,11/07/2017,I will purchase another pair I have had issues with my feet and that's help my feet still hurt but these shoes make it bearable,
120231,5,11/07/2017,"Adrenaline for IM 70.3 These felt great right out of the box. I tried several different pairs of shoes during my training for a half ironman and battled knee problems the whole time. I went back to the shoes that I used when training for half marathons years ago (the adrenalines!) And am happy to report I had no problems during my race! The shoes are a little heavier than I am used to, but to not have knee pain makes it worth it. #ReviewSweeps",
120231,4,11/07/2017,I would buy this if it came in 7W ,
120231,5,11/06/2017,"I would definitely buy again. This is my 2nd pair of Adrenaline GTS shoes, the first pair was the 15s and I loved those too. I use them mostly for trail running and hiking, but I've gone backpacking with them over several days and they do me right. I don't know if I'll ever get a different shoe. I have somewhat high arches and these give the perfect amount of support. The tread offers good stability in uneven terrain and the cushion is perfect. I can gush about them forever, seriously the best! #ReviewSweeps",
120231,5,11/06/2017,I will buy Brooks again ,
120231,5,11/06/2017,"My recent purchase was to replace a previous Adrenaline pair I run every other day, averaging 10 miles/week. I replaced the insole with a Superset pair. The shoes feel great, fit me like a glove and I love the color scheme. My previous pair was Adrenaline 15. That was my first time trying Brooks shoes and I am a convert.",
120231,5,11/06/2017,The ONLY shoes I'll run in! I have these both in wide width and regular. I use the wide width for longer runs because my feet tend to swell and these give just enough extra room to stay comfortable til the finish. The normal width I use more for everyday or shorter runs and they are just as comfy. Both give me plenty of support around my heels and on my arch.,
120231,5,11/06/2017,Love this shoe! Extremely comfortable with being on my feet all day with just the right amount of support. Worth the price!,
120231,4,11/06/2017,Support I love the cushion and support that they provide. I find it hard to walk in any other brand now that I've started wearing Brooks.,
120231,5,11/06/2017,Perfect! Wouldn't Change a Thing! This is the first time I have purchased Brooks shoes and orderd based on reviews. I couldn't be more pleased.,
120231,5,11/06/2017,great shoe I chose this shoe after being analyzed by Brooks at a local race expo. I had been experiencing some issues I had never had before such as arch pain and shin splints on a regular basis. I had wore brooks previously but not this shoe. The heel pain started after wearing another shoe from another brand totally not the shoe for me . This shoe had made a tremendous difference along with visits to my chiropractor and foam rolling  I have only had the opportunity to run 2 5k races in them so far have not experienced any heel or shin pain while running with these shoes.Totally impressed so far thanks to your staff and analysis.,
120231,5,11/06/2017,Still an Adrenaline GTS fan! I've been wearing this style for years and love them.  Comfortable right out of the box and durable.  I love the color I got and have gotten a lot of compliments.  Continue making these in cool colors.  I remember when they would only come in white and blue.,
120231,5,11/06/2017,LOVE these!! ,
120231,5,11/05/2017,t I am a retired runner. I do walk and wear these for work.  I love the support and comfort!  #ReviewSweeps,
120231,5,11/05/2017,On my 6th pair! Love them! I am a retired runner. I love these shoes for walking now. I wear them to work.,
120231,5,11/05/2017,Great Sneaker! I walk everyday and run about once or twice a week. This sneaker is perfect and I hope that brooks does not change this style one bit! Supper supportive but also flexible. Overall great great shoe.,
120231,5,11/05/2017,I would buy another pair ,
120231,4,11/05/2017,I really love these shoes! ,
120231,5,11/05/2017,"Adrenaline G-17 feels good and longer laces, thank you Adrenaline is my go to, then Ravena. I got my new Adrenaline runners about 2 weeks ago and just broke them in this weekend. I love them and the best part, somebody got the memo that longer laces were needed and necessary. Especially for a runner's loop. Thank you Thank you.",
120231,5,11/05/2017,Best Adrenaline yet! I started wearing the Adrenaline with model 15 and was very pleased.  My feet met their 'perfect match' which is not easy to do.  Both the 16 and 17 have not disappointed me either and will be purchasing the 18.Shoes are so specific to an individual's feet; what works for one person will not necessary work for another.  I learned this the hard way years ago when I was more interested in the fashion of the shoe vs the function and suffered during a training.  However I have had consistent positive experiences with Brooks - which also look great - and would recommend to a friend to find their own model and perfect fit.,
120231,2,11/05/2017,"Didn't work as well as the Ghost. Tried these out on a 10 mile run.  They felt too stiff and short.  I always get a 8.5 in Ghost and Glycerins, but the 8.5 in these seemed at least a half size smaller.  Not comfortable at all.  Felt heavy and stiff. Returned for the Ghost 10.",
120231,5,11/04/2017,"I am absolutely a fan of Brooks!! Brooks running shoes are the most durable and comfortable shoes I have found. They are a bit pricey, but my experience is that they last twice as long as other brands I have tried.",
120231,5,11/04/2017,Great shoe. #reviewsweeps.  Good shoe with wide base.  I wear it for work and play 10 hours a day.  Unfortunately they are over 100.00 and the heel starts to collapse and break down in about 3 months.  I wish they lasted 6 months.,
120231,5,11/04/2017,The best shoe ,
120231,5,11/04/2017,"I am very happy with these shoes! I need a show with a wide toe box, Brooks were recommended to me, and I love them! They fit great, comfortable and my toes aren't rubbing against each other.",
120231,5,11/04/2017,Great walking shoes ,
120231,5,11/04/2017,I love this sneaker! This is so comfortable. I would definitely recommend this sneaker. I can walk all day without anydiscomfort on my feet. The cushion and support are most important to me. Veryhappy for this purchase.,
120231,5,11/04/2017,"Lovely, comfortable, with a stable base I wear them all day into the evening.  Sad the heels start to compress in 3 months and cause turning of the ankle.",
120231,5,11/04/2017,"Brooks never disappoint me!! I LOVE these shoes!  The Adrenaline GTS has been my go to running shoe for quite some time. Comfort is why I am obsessed with these shoe, so much cushion and it's everywhere! I run about 20-30 miles weekly and Brooks is with me every step I take! #ReviewSweeps",
120231,5,11/04/2017,The Adrenaline is my long run shoe ,
120231,5,11/04/2017,Prefect fit!!! ,
120231,5,11/04/2017,Perfect fit!! My all time favorite running shoe. ,
120231,5,11/03/2017,I continue to buy this shoe year after year. I have worn the Brooks Adrenaline for the last 16 years.  I started wearing them when I got Plantar fasciitis.  I tried one other brand about 7 years ago and ended up going back to the Brooks Adrenaline and have stayed with them ever since.,
120231,5,11/03/2017,Absolutely Love These!!! I absolutely love these!!! They have so much support and are super comfortable. They definitely helped correct my stride and feel great when running indoors or out.,
120231,5,11/03/2017,"The only shoe for me I do 45 minutes on the treadmill, 7 days a week. These shoes provide the heel & arch support that I need. I love them!",
120231,5,11/03/2017,Good for my heel fat pad atrophy Mine are Brooks GTS Seventeen. I did insert my own orthotic. I feel like these shoes have restored my mobility. Love them.,
120231,5,11/03/2017,"Love my Adrenalines I run 20-30 miles a week and live my Adrenalines. I had 3 pair of the 16's and the 17's are just as perfect. They give me great support, plenty of room in the toe box to prevent purple toenails, and comfortable as well. I don't ever want another shoe!",
120231,5,11/03/2017,I would buy this shoe again and again ,
120231,5,11/03/2017,I would buy this product again and again. I run in these shoes 3-5 times a week with an average weekly mileage of 9-15 miles.  I love these shoes so much I'm buying a spare pair to alternate.,
120231,1,11/03/2017,I would not buy again I will be returning these very disappointed!! Now I'm going to be without shoes during the whole return process,
120231,5,11/03/2017,Love adrenaline I love the adrenalines. I really haven't a style of them that I hated. They are super comfy. I have wide feet and have a hard time fiend shows for work to fit my feet comfortably. These are the only brand & style I wear. The only thing I have been bummed about lately are the colors. They are limited in the wide and not the greatest. It is hard to find a color that goes with all of my scrubs. #ReviewSweeps,
120231,5,11/02/2017,Best shoes on the market!!! brooks are great!!!! She had 2 pair one for training and one pair for running races. Great shoes!!!!,
120231,5,11/02/2017,I've bought 3 pair These look great and feel great.  I bought 3 pair and rotate them when my milage increases.,
120231,5,11/01/2017,"The Only Shoe I Will Run In! I bought my first pair of Adrenaline GTS shoes back in June 2011 before I ran in my first half marathon. I pronate a little while I run and these shoes have amazing support. Two and a half years ago I switched to Brooks Ravenna's and I liked those shoes as well, but I decided to try to Adrenaline GTS shoes again to see if I liked them better than my Ravenna's. I felt so amazing after my first run in the Adrenaline 17s I don't think I'll go back to the Ravenna's. This really is the best running shoe. I love all the colors and they have amazing support. I've been tracking my miles, I'm curious to see how long they'll last and how far they'll go!",
120231,3,11/01/2017,Ordered same shoe I always wear and they seem too small I wear brooks every at work. The new pair are the same shoe but is smaller. I wore them two days and my feet hurt horribly,
120231,5,11/01/2017,Love these shoes! The shoe is a little bulkier than i usually buy but they are oh so comfortable!! It's like walking on a cloud seriously! Never hurt my feet even the first couple of times wearing them to get broken in.,
120231,5,11/01/2017,I buy this style everytime I purchase Brooks. ,
120231,5,11/01/2017,"Love this shoe These are the best shoes I have ever had for running. The shoe itself is high quality and supportive, so my feet rarely hurt, even after running marathons. They are so comfortable that I continually buy the same shoe in different colors to replace my previous pair when they have too many miles. For the quality the price is great, there have been many times I've run 20 miles in the rain and the shoes still look fairly new- even after hitting the 300 mile mark on them! #ReviewSweeps",
120231,5,11/01/2017,Support and comfort! My husband and I walk every morning and I needed a new pair of sneaks. I previously had a pair of Brooks and decided to try them again. They are supportive but not stiff and comfortable. And I love the colors!,

120231,5,10/31/2017,Lots of stability I was having some over probation problems causing foot pain. I switched to the Adrenaline to try and correct this problem along with strengthening and had great results. My pain has been almost eliminated. Great stability shoe!,
120231,5,10/31/2017,Best Shoe for Me I had foot surgery about a year ago and also have a wide foot so I have to be careful about the athletic shoes I buy. My first pair was recommended by the shoe consultant at the orthotics store. They worked so well immediately after and during my recovery. The shoe style still works a year later so I will keep buying it as long as Brooks keeps making it. Wish they had more colors for us wide widths!,

They work great since I am moving patients in beds throughout the day and stand on concrete or hard floors!",

120231,5,10/30/2017,"I love these shoes! After 4 years of not buying new tennis shoes (eek!), my mom told me about these shoes that her physical therapist recommended. She was in love with them after a month so I decided to give them a shot too! Worth every penny. Thank goodness we have the same shoe size so I was easily able to tell I need a half size up. They are so comfortable. My feet have been missing out!",
120231,5,10/30/2017,"Love these shoes! These shoes offer great cushioning and support. I've completed 6 half marathons this year (and all the training that goes along with them), all wearing Adrenaline 17's. These are my go to shoe.",

120231,5,10/30/2017,"True to size. Comfortable and stylish I used to be a runner, and Brooks was the first truly comfortable pair of running shoes I owned. Over the years I developed various foot and knee ailments that made me take running out of my workouts. However, I am still committed to Brooks shoes. They are so comfortable in my walks and strength training. Also, they unique designs are so stylish.",
120231,5,10/30/2017,Excellent choice for work (I rotate 3 pair of Brooks shoes) I am a registered nurse. Typical day at work is 12-15000 steps. Brooks are wonderful,
120231,5,10/30/2017,I just love my Brooks. These are the most comfortable sneakers I've  owned.  I'm on my 7th pair.  The only thing I get are insoles with heel cups and this really improves the comfort for my walking .,
120231,5,10/30/2017,Super cushion ,
120231,2,10/30/2017,Not my favorite It seems like a good shoe but just not a good feel for me. It feels too narrow and when I run on the street it almost feels too grippy to the pavement. Next time think I will go back to my new balances.,
120231,3,10/29/2017,"Order size larger than your normal shoe size Normally wear a size 7 shoe.  Because I have a narrow heel, I need to get these in an 8 1/2.  Would like more padding in the ball of foot area.  I would like to see more colors available in the narrow sizes.",
120231,4,10/29/2017,"Terrific shoe for long, fast walks Excellent for speed walking and long walks. I set my laces up to lock for extra support around the back and the heal. I wish the laces were longer for this purpose. I also wish the tongue was just a little longer as well.",

120231,3,10/29/2017,"Small toe box Loyal Adrenaline wearer, but even in wide the toe box is smaller than before and a seam rubs on the upper part of my foot, right over the screw that's implanted in the joint. Ouch.",

120231,5,10/29/2017,"Liked enough I bought it again I walk/jog 2 miles - 1/2 marathons. These shoes have held up really well(18 races plus dog walking), fit great (I normally buy wide but these in normal are great). Bought a second pair for upcoming races, old pair will be everyday shoes.",

120231,5,10/29/2017,"Love Adrenaline, my very best running shoe, great support ",
120231,4,10/29/2017,Love my Adrenalines I run a few times a week usually 5k with some longer runs when I'm training for a half marathon. I like that Brooks reinforced the area near the baby toe as the previous pair I had quickly wore through in that area. I wish there were more color choices in the wider widths. I like the arch support I get in these shoes.,
120231,5,10/29/2017,My Adrenaline GTS helps me to the finish line ,
120231,5,10/28/2017,Perfect as always I have a bunion and this is the one pair of running shoes I can wear that does not aggravate it.  I have been buying this style for several years now and will continue to so long as it is made.,

120231,5,10/28/2017,I would buy Brooks again. I've had surgery on both of my feet.  I've worn Brooks Adrenaline running shoes for about 5 years now.  I love them. They are comfortable and very supportive. I have recommended them to many of my friends and they love them too.,

120231,5,10/28/2017,I'm in love with this shoe I love how it feels like it gives me a little extra energy every time I pick up my feet while I'm running!,
120231,5,10/28/2017,"Very comfortable I'm a very casual runner, not looking to do any marathons, just wanted a shoe that give good support. This one did just that without feeling too heavy.",
120231,5,10/28/2017,Great shoes for work I love my shoes. I needed an all black shoe. I normally have duty boots but tried sneakers this time. I work 12 hrs shifts and am walking at least 7 miles on concrete all day. These shoes are great. I don't have any fatigue in them at all at the end of the day. My only wish/hope is that they continue this colour for next generations,
120231,4,10/28/2017,Great Shoes I love my addiction shoes but these Adrenalinea are a close second.  I walk 2-3 miles 4 times a week. They provide great support.,
120231,5,10/28/2017,"Asmilefortoday This Brooks running shoe was recommended to me by my doctor.  I have planter fasciitis and achilles tendinitis and have for 7 years now.  This shoe supports the arch of my foot, it snugs my ankle and foot in every possible way.  I am now in my 6th pair and control the problems with my feet by buying the best shoes out there.  This is my tennis shoe of choice and the only tennis shoe I will wear.",
120231,5,10/28/2017,I would buy these again! ,
120231,3,10/28/2017,Great shoe but not as good as the 16 I am a die hard Brooks customer & recommend these shoes to everyone I know but this shoe does not feel like it has as much support as the other GTS's I have purchased in the past.,
120231,2,10/28/2017,I loved these but... I had a pair of GTS 16s and loves them so I figured the GTS 17s would be just a great.... NOT. While they were completely comfortable and great for my short and long runs they wore ridiculously fast. I had holes on the upper front toe area within the first 3 weeks. Very disappointing. I am hoping the 18s are better as I really loved the adrenalines as a change from my previous running shoe (non-Brooks).,
120231,4,10/28/2017,This is my very first pair of Brooks.  Very comfortable shoe I'm a walker and Brooks was recommended due to the support. So i'll try them out to see if they compare to or make me give up my ASICS.,

120231,5,10/27/2017,BEST shoe ever ! I absolutely love this shoe. Super comfortable and conforms to your foot. Brooks running shoes have become my new favorite tennis shoe. I find they run either a half size or a full size too small . But no other shoe beats the support and comfort . Thank you,
120231,5,10/27/2017,"Best workout shoes I have ever owned ! I wear running shoes for high impact fitness classes.I take a lot of Zumba classes and even though there is dancing involved, it is mixed with high impact moves and these shoes give me the best support and protection.",

120231,5,10/27/2017,"Super comfortable & supportive. I bought my first pair of Adrenaline GTS in 2012. Every time I wear a pair out, I replace them with the same product because they are that comfortable. #ReviewSweeps",

I love them and purchase a new pair every year.  I normally wear a medium width, but I go up to a wide because I am on my feet for 4 hours on a golf course. Love, love, love my Brooks.....please don't change them.",
120231,5,10/26/2017,Love these shoes! Bought these shoes halfway through training for a half marathon and never once felt like I had to break them in. They were comfortable from the beginning.,
120231,5,10/26/2017,"My favorite running shoe! Even though I try to train in two different brands of running shoe to help prevent injury, this has been my go to shoe for races and long runs for several years. Nice wide toe box.",

120231,4,10/26/2017,"Love my Brooks #ReviewSweeps On my third pair of Brooks and I doubt I will go with another brand. I have to have extra wide and without going to men's shoes, Brooks is about the only brand to offer widths in styles that don't scream OLD LADY shoes! I'm older, but I still am not ready to wear the ortho shoes. These I can wear all day and into the evening and have little pain.",
120231,5,10/26/2017,Helpful title to confirm I am ordering same style I use I use my shoes for road running.  I continue to use this product due to longevity..... seems to last the longest and maintain quality the best for me,
120231,4,10/26/2017,"I love the right shoe! I love the right shoe! It's hard to make a judgment when the shoes don't fit! Not your fault - I have always  had difficulty fitting shoes to my feet - my left foot is larger than my right, so it's the left shoe which is too small....I love the right one, and would recommend it to any runner....",
120231,5,10/26/2017,Great shoe! This shoe provides great support for walking and jogging. I will continue to purchase brooks running shoes.,

120231,5,10/25/2017,I've had GTS adrenaline for 8 yrs now I have used this shoe for marathons and for casual light running.  I sure hope to be able to use the adrenaline GTS forever!  I got the gray with light purple accents.  It's my favorite shoe color they have made.  It's surprisingly hard to find a gray running shoe!,
120231,5,10/25/2017,Bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. ,
120231,5,10/24/2017,"Perfect fit with great arch support A little more stiff than most running shoes, but with my collapsing arch that is exactly what I was looking for. Great for running, cross-fit and everyday use. I love all the online color choices!!",

They aren't as ""pillow soft"" as was described to me from a friend but everyone's level of comfort is different.  I appreciate the stability I get from these shoes. I am more than happy with my purchase and would definitely buy them again #ReviewSweeps",
120231,5,10/24/2017,Great support! I wore Brooks years ago and at that time the support and fit were very good and they held up very well. Then I bought and wore other brands because I was shopping for the best price. Now I'm back and so glad to bring wearing Brooks again.  I've worn them all and this is the shoe for me.,
120231,5,10/24/2017,Brooks running shoes I dealt with plantar fasciitis for over 2 months and have to stand on concrete all day.  My daughter-in-law is a PT and told me I should get some of these shoes. She was absolutely right. They are wonderful. I'm going to have to buy another pair so I don't wear the same one every day! The foot pain is gone!,
120231,2,10/23/2017,I would not buy this verson of the Adrenalines again I have purchased Brooks Adrenaline's for years.  This is the first pair I am ready to send back.  The bottom of my feet hurt and I have never had that in Brooks.,

120231,3,10/23/2017,"Preferred GTS 16 and 15 I much preferred the GTS 15 and 16. The GTS 17, I had to go to 1/2 size larger and order narrow. They are still comfortable but feel a little large in toe box (even with narrow). I overpronate terribly and the GTS 17 does help prevent it better than other shoes.",
120231,5,10/23/2017,I would by again ,
120231,5,10/23/2017,tried and true! I switched to the GTS line for running shoes 6 years ago because of pronation issues and they have helped a ton! I will buy a new pair after about 300-350 miles,
120231,5,10/23/2017,I would definitely buy this product again. Love these shoes! 3rd pair of adrenaline GTS. Love how they feel. Training for a 10K and half marathon and they are working out well.,
120231,5,10/23/2017,I would buy this shoe again and have recommended  to friends I am 70. I had foot surgery.  My physical therapist told me about the shoe. It gives me the support I need after 12 weeks in a cast and boot.  They are good for older people who have foot problems. I will definitely  order more in the future.,
120231,5,10/23/2017,"These are great shoes! I had developed plantar fasciitis, with frequent pain in my feet.  After changing to Brooks shoes, the pain is gone!  I am a nurse, on my feet 12 hours + at a time, so they get a lot of use.  I would highly recommend, and have, to several friends.",

120231,5,10/23/2017,"Light and cushiony These fit and feel similar to my Ghosts - lightweight and bouncy. Size is consistent with other Brooks. Convinced my friend to order them after I got mine, and now we're both fans.",
120231,5,10/23/2017,#running Sweeps I buy this sneaker again and again! I have been wearing these sneakers for more than 8 years and lov them.  I hen I put them on my feet are in heaven!,

120231,4,10/23/2017,I would buy this again I wear this shoe as an everyday universal shoe. I have extremely bad knees and need a good shoe with extreme cushion. I did have to replace insole after about 3 weeks with my own for continued cushion comfort.,
120231,5,10/22/2017,Perfection I am a nursing instructor working long hours on my feet. I bought the white leather for that purpose. I am so in love with the comfort I will not wear anything else. So this pair is for my off hours😍,
120231,4,10/21/2017,"VERY Supportive Shoe Went for my first run in these sneakers today and I am so glad I got them! I've been having knee pain - the kind that sidelines you- for 2 months and have been wearing a brace when I went back to running. I ran without the brace today and it feels totally fine! I will say they are pretty heavy to run in- which is why I took off one star, but if are in need of a very supportive shoe - the pros far outweigh that one con. Also, I would recommend ordering a half size up. I ignored others advice to do so and needed to return my first pair for a larger size. Will definitley be sticking to this shoe.",
120231,5,10/21/2017,Very Happy I was afraid to switch from my standard Adrenaline GTS 16 but I am very pleased with the GTS 17. It felt like putting on the same shoe but better! The fit feels perfectly snug but not too tight. The support is great for me since I am used to a high stability shoe. I chose a more bold color than the usual white and I'm happy with he look of the shoe as well. The bottom of the shoe is sturdy and is holding up nicely especially considering that I live on an island with lots of sharp volcano rock. I do crossfit too and it doesn't seem to be a good shoe for that so I switch to another shoe for rope climbs etc. but for running I highly recommend this shoe!#ReviewSweeps,
120231,3,10/21/2017,Not much cushion ,

120231,5,10/18/2017,"Yasss Honey...the Adrenaline is Pumpin' This is my first pair of Brooks and I'm loving them. I was wearing a different brand (H.O.O.) but I like the increased arch support, the traction support, and the overall comfort of Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17!",

120231,1,10/17/2017,"Wide Width still too narrow I love the look.  If my toes hadn't fallen asleep, I would have kept it!  I've tried two other Brooks lines and loved them.  I will buy Brooks again, just not this line.",
120231,5,10/16/2017,The Most Comfortable Shoe Ever! I recently learned that I have overpronating low arch feet and these are amazing. The arch support makes me feel like they're made just for me. I took them off and now I can't wait to get them back on.,
120231,5,10/15/2017,Best shoe for Narrow Feet I love this shoe and have been wearing them for 10 years.  Great stability shoe for road running.  I only wish the narrow came in other colors like black or dark gray.,
120231,5,10/15/2017,"Great bounce and solid footbed. Great for long runs. These shoes are comfortable and supportive without feeling heavy. I love them for my runs. Anywhere from 3-8 miles, they keep my feet feeling energized.",
120231,4,10/14/2017,"Adrenalines continue to be great shoes I've been wearing this on my weekly runs. Provides comfort on the road and on the treadmill, and I love how much lighter they feel on my feet than the last gen.",
120231,5,10/14/2017,I love the Adrenaline GTS 17 These are great shoes! They are both comfortable and supportive straight out of the box. I had a pair of GTS 16's that we're great but I feel these are even more comfortable and cushioned than the 16's. I haven't had any issues with rubbing or pinching anywhere. They're an all around great shoe and I will definitely buy again! Plus they're super cute!,
120231,5,10/13/2017,"Great ol' faithful Adrenalines has been my favorite running shoes for years.  This version lives up to my expectations for comfort and stability.  The Toe Box feels just a tiny bit wider than the Adrenaline 16, so now my toes are still happy at the end of long runs.  Thanks Brooks for making that adjustment, and for your faithfulness in making this a great shoe!",
120231,5,10/13/2017,Best running shoes I've ever had hands down! ,
120231,5,10/13/2017,"Love this shoe! This shoe is the only shoe I have found that works with my feet to give full support. I have purchased the GTS series shoes since Brooks first developed them because they feel so good! With other brands and styles, I struggled with recurrent severe plantar fasciitis. Since switching to the Brooks GTS series, no foot pain or injuries. Happy customer!",
120231,5,10/13/2017,I would highly recommend I needed arch support not to mention I stand most of my 10 hour workdays. These are very supportive and comfortable. Awesome product!,
120231,5,10/13/2017,"I would highly recommend! #ReviewsweepsLove this ""rock and roll"" edition. I stand all day (actually 10hours). Shoe is very supportive.",
120231,5,10/12/2017,I love how the Adrenaline fits! I use the running shoe for only running. I do not use them for everyday stuff. This way it forms to my running style and is very comfortable.,
120231,5,10/12/2017,I would TOTALLY buy this product again  #ReviewSweeps ,
120231,5,10/12/2017,"Love these shoes! I absolutely love these shoes for running! I went to get fitted at a runners store due to needed new shoes anyway but was trying to find something with a good fit that could help keep away the shin splints and add some distance to my runs. I was just starting out, could barley run a mile straight. After a few weeks in these shoes my feet don't hurt, my calves are no where near as sore and I have been able to increase and add 2+ miles more to my distance. So glad I found these shoes",
120231,5,10/12/2017,I love Brooks running shoes! ,
120231,5,10/12/2017,Will buy again for sure My daughter runs XC and this is the only shoe she will wear to train!  Her feet are narrow and this fit her perfectly.,
120231,5,10/12/2017,Most consistent buy EVERYTIME! ,
120231,5,10/12/2017,Most consistent buy EVERYTIME ***** ,
120231,5,10/12/2017,"No more Asics!! Ever since Asics changed their sizing so that everything runs way too small, I have not been able to find a good, quality, comfy, supportive shoe. My search ended with Brooks.  Never again will I buy another brand!",
120231,5,10/11/2017,Love these shoes! Highly recommend! These shoes helped me kick my plantar's faciitis to the curb in time for the Grand Rapids Marathon. Love them and LOVE the color!,
120231,3,10/11/2017,"Toes I'm normally an 8.5 but buy a 9 or else they are to tight. These shoes are super comfortable to run and I love them. My only big draw back is the toe holes that my less then 6 month old shoes (less than 300,miles on the shoes) are developing. As much as I love them something needs to be done abut reenforcing the toe area but if the design stays the same I won't buy anymore.",
120231,5,10/10/2017,I love these shoes!! ,
120231,4,10/10/2017,I love the support but my shoe squeaks I am extremely loyal to Brooks but this pair and the last pair (Brooks for 17 years) squeak after wearing only once or twice,
120231,5,10/09/2017,"Have bought again and again... On my sixth pair of Adrenalines and I love them!  Now I can't imagine running in anything else.  I replace about every 4 months after 400 miles.  I just hope Brooke's doesn't mess with a good thing because these are perfection!  I love the comfort, fit, and color selections.",
120231,2,10/09/2017,"Too short and uncomfortable. These felt shorter in length than the Ravenna and my heel was slipping up as I walked.  There are light in weight but did not work for me.  I've worn Brooks for years but lately have not been able to find a style that I want to wear.  The color looked ok online but when I saw it in person, it was not a color I would wear.  Brooks is definitely not marketing to older women because the color combinations are not anything my friends or I would wear and we aren't interested in just black or white.   I need a wide width because of orthotics and many wides aren't available in all the color combinations.  I would wear the Ravenna but there is no color that I would order.  I'm going to have to switch brands.",
120231,5,10/09/2017,I always go back to the same one! ,
120231,5,10/09/2017,Another great pair of Brooks. I have been wearing brooks adrenaline for about 4 years now and I will never wear another shoes. Supportive and cute! #reviewsweeps,
120231,5,10/09/2017,"My favorite running shoes I'm training for my 3rd half marathon and this is my 4th pair of Adrenelines. After my first pair, I would never go back to any other brand of running shoe.  The GTS 17s are even more comfortable than my previous pair. I can not sing the praises of these shoes enough.",
120231,5,10/07/2017,"Looks great, feels great. Love the color, knit look with all the support. This is my 12th pair of Adrenaline's.",
120231,5,10/07/2017,Most supportive shoe I've ever worn I work in a lab and am always on my feet. I wouldn't survive my shifts without the support of these shoes. They are high quality and comfortable.,
120231,4,10/06/2017,"Comfortable, but needs a better toe area material Adrenaline GTS 17 shoes are very comfortable and offer great support. I wear these shoes 4 miles daily. I over pronate and have flat arches, but these shoes don't give me any pain whatsoever. They are the only shoes I have ever worn that are this comfortable. I can go for miles and miles and not think about my feet once. The problem with these shoes is the plastic toe area protector doesn't come over far enough to keep holes from forming on top of the shoe. It is unfortunate, too, because the shoe looked so nice before the hole formed. I bought them in April 2017 and by September 2017 the hole had formed. My husband wears Nike and his shoes never get holes, but I would still much rather have comfortable shoes with holes than wear Nike.",
120231,5,10/06/2017,LOVE THESE I'm training for a marathon and have two pairs of these to rotate between or let one pair dry out for when it's a soggy run.  I was a faithful Trance runner until they were discontinued.  I found the Transcend too soft and these feel responsive but help with my overpronation.  The laces NEVER come untied.  Just did 16 miles the other day in these with no pain and no residual aches in knees or ankles.  I highly recommend these for runners looking for responsive support.,
120231,3,10/06/2017,"maybe wrong shoe for me? b I bought these shoes in May of 2017, size 8 2E.  I walk between 3 to 5 miles a day and rotate between three different shoes.  Probably wear these a little more frequently.  I underpronate and it sure shows in the shoe.  The shoe is now pretty uncomfortable and has been for the last month which means they only lasted 3 to 4 months.  These shoes started out comfortable but I can't be buying this shoe every 3 to 4 months.  Not sure what to do but I am researching alternatives.",
120231,5,10/05/2017,Finally found my shoe!! Works great with my prescribed inserts. Excited to run for many years to come in the Adrenaline!,
120231,5,10/04/2017,First time buyer and love them This is my first Brooks purchase and ill never buy another brand again! I absolutely love them!,
120231,4,10/04/2017,"LOVE this shoe! But . . . I LOVE this shoe! I started with the Ghost 6 in a size 9 which was perfect in size and comfort! When I went to purchase the Ghost 8 in the size 9, it seemed really snug so I got the 9 1/2. It didn't give me the support I needed and seemed a ""sloppy"" fit after a month or so. I endured for a season and then tried the Adrenaline GTS 17. Also small, but I went back to the size 9. I have tried on numerous other Brooks shoes because i DO love the brand, but they all appear to be tight. I've recently had to be fit with orthotics. When my doctor tried to put the size 9 device in my Brooks, he said, ""This isn't a size 9 shoe, It's about an 8 3/4"" which is what I had been feeling all along! What changed two years ago in the design? As another review said, PLEASE bring back the old sizing! I LOVE Brooks and don't want to have to go to another brand to get them to fit properly!!",
120231,4,10/03/2017,"Not as good as I thought My doctor recommended Brooks and I went with this shoe after reading all the great reviews.  I have flat feet and need that extra support around my heal and I also have a orthotics from my doctors.  Well, I think they broke down awful fast, usually I can get a good 9 to 12 months out of a good expensive shoe but not this one, my feet hurt so bad and I have only had them a little over three months, so I couldn't send them back. That's fine, it was my fault for not paying attention to the calendar.   So I went in to a store that sells this brand and I am going to try the Ariel '16 which are $160 and a little out of my pay range but for a good shoe I am willing to pay the price.  I will just make sure I watch the calendar this time.",
120231,5,10/02/2017,Like walking on air! I am a nurse and have had trouble with my feet for the past few years. These shoes have fixed and pain I had. I wish they came in a flip flop version!,
120231,5,10/02/2017,Adrenaline GTS....the ONLY way to run! I have been wearing Adrenaline GTS for many years now. I won't wear anything else. I almost changed though in 2015...horrible changes were made that year and Brooks listened to their customers...thank goodness.  Love the fun colors.,
120231,4,10/01/2017,HELPED my running style improve!!! I ordered these shoes wide which I'm glad I did because they still feel somewhat narrow! With some break in they feel a little better. I read some reviews where others stated their pinkie toe hurts from being rubbed against the strip from the outside design which it does. Again with break in and thinner socks this has improved.  My hills bother me and these assist with that.  They feel like my feet hit the ground more balanced and secure!!!! I would buy them again but maybe with extra wide next time!!!,
120231,5,10/01/2017,These are my shoes for life. I mainly run casually but have ran a few half marathons.  This style and brand of shoe has been my go to shoe for over six years. They are super light and extremely comfortable. I've had no problems.,
120231,5,09/30/2017,"I DO buy these shoes again and again! I was measured for running/walking shoes years ago.  I was led to this shoe.  I have purchased these over and over since. Great support,  good cushion, and not too much arch! Absolutely perfect for me!",
120231,4,09/30/2017,I would like it better if it didnt get holes in them. ,
120231,4,09/29/2017,I knew I would love it! This is my second pair of Brooks shoes. I ordered them online after chancing upon the previous adrenaline GTS and wearing them out. I loved not having to try on shoes in the store; they feel just as great as my old pair. I pronate and need extra support. This show is great because it gives enough support without feeling heavy or looking bulky. The only thing I don't like is the laces; the material is very light but the aglets at the ends are heavy. If I don't shorten them up they swing and hit the shoes pretty hard with each step.,
120231,3,09/29/2017,"Not the same comfort level as past GTS have been. I have used Brooks since gen 10, and they have always fit perfectly. This pair if 8 D seem narrower than those of past years though and are not as cushy either.",
120231,5,09/26/2017,"This is my fifth adrenaline GTS since 2010 I love them. It is so comfortable, I have used so much brand that were really hurt my feet but brooks 👍👏",
120231,5,09/26/2017,They are great . comfortable..and pretty ,
120231,5,09/26/2017,"Just what they promise It's the Brooks Adrenaline! Everyone should wear this shoe at least once in their life (if you need a stability shoe). More cushion than previous models. Great support. Perfect fit. On the heavier side for a stability shoe. Overall, I love it!",
120231,5,09/24/2017,"Great support I was looking for stability, and this shoe definitely provides it. I have bought the blue with purple which looked a little more feminine",
120231,4,09/24/2017,"I have just bought a 2nd pair of BROOKS!!! These are worn everyday, just for every day wear. I have severe pronation and these are very stable and give the support I need.",
120231,5,09/24/2017,I love these shoes I love these shoes because they are very supportive for mid moderate arches and my gait. They feel solid when I walk and hug my feet well.,
120231,5,09/23/2017,"I would buy this produce again These are my go to shoes for walking, exercising, running errands and general recreational use.",
120231,5,09/22/2017,"Wearing the Adrenaline for 12+ years Been wearing this shoe for 12+ years!! Love it but would like more color options, including neutral colors.",
120231,5,09/22/2017,Adrenaline GTS 17 Great shoe ,
120231,5,09/22/2017,"LOVE! I use these sneakers for running mid-long distances. I previously owned two pairs of Adrenaline 16's before these came out. I was skeptical because I believed the 16's were perfect -- until I tried on the 17's! They are much more comfortable, not as tight feeling and feel super stable but not stiff while running. 5 stars.",
120231,5,09/22/2017,Best sneakers for bunions I have bunions and it is hard to find a sneaker that is comfortable for more than a few minutes/miles. Brooks are perfect,
120231,4,09/21/2017,"This shoe gives me the support I need for boot camp, etc! The Brooks customer service rep that helped me when I was having bunion/joint pain was great! He listened to my problem and sent me an exchange that gave me immediate relief from the foot pain I was dealing with. Thank you!",
120231,5,09/21/2017,These shoes were comfortable the moment I put them on. I walk several miles a week and these shoes have been comfortable and never held me back.,
120231,5,09/20/2017,Great Shoe! I own 4 pairs of this style. This is the first pair I purchased that is mostly fabric. I really like the weight and feel of the shoe.  On a side note I had an ordering problem and customer service was fantastic. Great shoe! Great company!,
120231,5,09/19/2017,Amazingly comfortable! ,
120231,5,09/19/2017,Great color great fit! ,
120231,5,09/19/2017,"So Comfortable!! These shoes make my feet so happy! Very comfortable, and great fit! Love them..",
120231,5,09/19/2017,Is this shoes ar suitable for Marathon? ,
120231,5,09/18/2017,"Great shoe These shoes are very comfortable. I haven't done any longer distances, mostly kept it around 5 miles, but no pain in my shins, feet or knees on those runs.",
120231,3,09/18/2017,"Better but not best The Adrenaline 17 are so much better than the  16 and 15, but still not as good as the 14.I like the color choices and the good arch support. The sole feels stiff and the toebox is small.",
120231,3,09/17/2017,Arch too high Great shoe but too high an arch for me this time. I had the previous incarnation of this shoe and it was perfect. Need to return it😕,
120231,5,09/15/2017,Light weight without losing stability and support I always wear Adrenalines. This version definitly feels more light weight without losing all the support and stability.,
120231,5,09/15/2017,I Love Brooks!  My new fave running brand shoe! At first I was unsure of them and they felt like boats on my feet.  Gave it a week and fell in Love with them!  I would recommend these to anyone.  They are super stylish.  I am SO tired of seeing Nike everywhere I go.  Brooks needs to start being more of What I see.  ;),
120231,5,09/14/2017,Too many colors on one shoe Is there some way you could go back to offering Adrenalines in one color to a pair of shoes for folks who match outfits to shoes?,
120231,2,09/14/2017,This year's shoe runs small.  I returned and got half sz up. ,
120231,5,09/13/2017,"Very Comfortable shoes! Originally bought these shoes in my usual running shoe size but they were too snug. So I reordered them a half size larger and they're perfect! Very comfortable, lots of cushioning and support.",
120231,5,09/13/2017,My new forever brand! Glad I read the comments!  I wear a 7 - 7 1/2 depending on the brand and ordered a 7 1/2 per their recommendations.  Just cutting it on size as they do run small but the 7 1/2 works for me with thin socks.  Ran 3 miles after not running for nearly a month and felt as though I could keep going!  The comfort is my type as the shoe is solid with support and cushion - I will be switching over to these running shoes from now on.,
120231,4,09/12/2017,"Decent walking shoe As a prior Brooks pure connect owner I am looking for a reliable shoe that I can order and wear walking right out of the box.  These are mostly ok, some arch pain, not perfect but I will keep them. Trying Ghost next.",
120231,5,09/12/2017,You've got a new customer in me What led me to you is the extra wide width for women.  Just can't find them.  Hope you get more styles available for those of us who grew up in the comfort of birkenstocks and now have wide feet.  I still believe in comfort and your Brooks are.  Do you make a golf shoe?,
120231,2,09/11/2017,"Something Changed I bought my 1st pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17 in January 2017 from Dicks sporting goods.  I LOVED them.  I trained for & ran 3 half marathons in them. When it came time to replace, I bought the EXACT same shoe directly from Brooks. Same size, same width, color, everything.  However, with the new ones, any run longer than 5 miles HURT my feet & toes so bad it almost brought me to tears. Not sure what happened, but I have to send them back.",
120231,3,09/11/2017,"Run smaller than the others I have bought strictly bought and ran in Adrenaline shoes for the last 10 years. I have always worn a 6.5 (a half size larger than my normal size), but the 6.5 are too small. I am worried that a 7 will be too big and slip around. These are going back. :(",
120231,5,09/10/2017,"Best shoe I've ever own. I had to switch these shoes 3 times to get the size that was appropriate for me. The first time I bought an 8.5 regular and it was too tight so I exchanged those for a 9.5 regular. The 9.5 gave me a blister on my small toe on my left foot and the tonge of the shoe was not long enough so it kept rubbing against the front of my ankle which ended up giving me a really bad scratch. I have knee problems and I'm training for a 1/2 marathon so I noticed that they did helped my knees and I really wanted to keep them. I decided to go back to my local running store and try a 9.5 Wide this time. When I tried the wider size it made a big difference because the left shoe was not rubbing against my toe anymore so I knew it was going tontake care of my blister problem. Also, I don't know if the 9.5 regular shoes were defective, but the tongue of the shoes were longer and more padded on the wider size so no more rubbing on my ankle. Even the store rep. who helped me noticed that. Anyway, today I jogged over 8 miles and I did not get any blisters for the first time ever and my shoes where so comfortable! and my knees didn't hurt as bad as they usually do because of the awesome shock absorption of he addrenalines. Seriously, best running shoes I've ever owned! Couldn't be happier!",
120231,5,09/09/2017,I recommend these to my friends I can use these for my every day shoe or running shoe I might even try them out for my work shoe still thinking about that I am in the health care field and work long shifts on my feet,
120231,5,09/08/2017,"Love this shoe AND the colors! I run about 80 miles a week on a variety of surfaces (mostly concrete/asphalt though) and LOVE this shoe! It has enough stability, good arch support, and doesn't make my foot feel like it's on a board.",
120231,5,09/08/2017,"Love them! At first they hurt my feet, but that was probably related to the foot injury I was going through.  Got some felt inserts put in from my podiatrist and now they are the most comfortable, supportive shoes I have.  I can finally work my way back into running and training for 5K's and half marathons.  I ordered a half size up as suggested from other reviews, and they were perfect!  Not to mention, I love the color that I got.  I also like the 90 day trial period, which I was hoping not to use, with the help of my podiatrist, they should be perfect and no return necessary!",
120231,5,09/08/2017,"I would not hesitate to buy this shoe again. This is a well built shoe.  I have severe problems with feet, and this shoe is very supportive.  With orthotics I upped to a wide and find it a perfect fit",
120231,5,09/08/2017,"Love these shoes! I work 12 hour shifts, and these are so comfortable to work in. My legs & feet don't ache at the end of a shift. Will definitely purchase more Brooks!",
120231,5,09/07/2017,Great shoe! I have been buying the Adrenaline for a few years. Love the shoe but last year they seem to be narrower than in the past. I have to order wide. The 17s seem to back on track! They fit great and I have no pain. I walk 3-4 15 min. miles a day and my feet feel great!,
120231,1,09/06/2017,Dissapointed Heel foam and rubber is falling apart after 3 months of running 10-15 miles a week. I am switching back to my ASICS which I'd ran 30 miles a week in for years and are showing less wear. The new materials feel more advanced at first but don't hold up when put to the test. I'm disappointed.,
120231,5,09/05/2017,so comfy i have flat arches and overpronate. I am also 300 lbs and finding a shoe for my aching feet has been a challenge. I found an online review for these and could not be happier!,
120231,5,09/05/2017,"Love my shoes!!!! I love the arch support and the room in the toe box. The shoe is light weight, but had support.",
120231,3,09/05/2017,I wanted and tried to love these sneakers. I wanted to love these sneakers. I believe the heaviness of the heel really made my heel start to ache. I have had planter fasciitis before and that's what it started to feel like. I hated that I had to return them. They did feel well cushioned. I had to switch back to my Ravenna's .,
120231,5,09/04/2017,"Great running sneaker, I wish I purchased them months ago ",
120231,5,09/04/2017,Have 4 pairs. Love this shoe.  Great for flat feet. Put my orthotics in them!!! Great fit...but I always get them 1/2 size larger than my normal shoes.,
120231,5,09/04/2017,Comfortable shoe. ,
120231,5,09/04/2017,"Always a winner I have wide feet and stability issues and it's so tough to find running shoes that fit comfortably. The Brooks Adrenaline has been my go-to for years. My podiatrist recommended them and he was right! My only wish is that Brooks would offer more color choices in wide widths each season. Sometimes what's available wouldn't be my first pick appearance-wise, but the fit and function is always on point.",
120231,5,09/01/2017,I love my Brooks ,
120231,5,08/31/2017,"Love this shoe I walk a lot, just getting things done around the house and often on the go. I love the support of Brooks, I promate a bit, and my feet get sore. I have an adult son with autism so I am on my feet often cooking, cleaning and making jewelry when I can. My new Brooks will look good going into cooler weather in Ohio with long sleeve tees and sweaters and sporty jackets",
120231,4,08/31/2017,"Sturdy Shoe Didn't like the stiff feel of outer footbed but could be good for someone who wants a sturdy shoe with moderate cushioning.  I wear a 7.5, standard arch; shoe was true to size, with comfortable space in toe box.   Beware, shipping is very slow.",
120231,5,08/31/2017,"Love my shoes, I would buy this product again and again!! ",
120231,4,08/30/2017,"The only shoe for me... I have had the Adrenaline GTS in the past, and purchased a second pair shortly after this one (different color). For some reason, the metallic charcoal/black/rose feels wider than the others, even though it is the same size and style. That being said, it does not really detract from the overall comfort and quality of the shoe, but I gave it 4 stars for the perceived width. This is still my fave always! I use this pair for work as a nurse, the other less wide one for running.",
120231,5,08/29/2017,"Just the right amount of cushioning! Very comfortable shoe from the first run. No need to ""break in""  the shoe is lightweight, but still stable and great cushion.",
120231,4,08/29/2017,"Cute design but run really small! Super cute shoes, love all the colors. They run pretty good. They just came super small! I've had 5-6 pairs of Brooks including running a Marathon and several halfs with Brooks, but these are sooo tight! I may end up returning them because they're so much smaller than my others.",
120231,5,08/29/2017,"Definitely a ""Go to shoe"" I run ALMOST everyday and this shoe is fantastic! It's stable, comfortable, and has great grip on the road.",
120231,5,08/28/2017,SAVED MY LIFE!! I searched for 6 months for the right shoes. One point a sales person at a store told me i have  a problem...i told him i don't ...it is his shoes.I have flat feet...i am not an america..this shoe is PERFECT!!!  Solved all my problem. I walk every day 2-4 hours. Highly recommend !!!,
120231,5,08/28/2017,I love this new model and would buy again and again! This model is definitely upgrade from the 16. It feels lighter and more uniform to my foot when running. There is a obvious upgrade in the cushion which makes for a great run. The 17s were far easier to break in than the 16s. I've had 3 pairs of the 16s before I bought the 17s and I am highly impressed with the newer version!,
120231,5,08/28/2017,"I have bought this model every year and they still are great My right foot is wider than my left and I have zero arches, my toes point outward and I over pronate.  I bought two pairs of this model in different colors, one for gym and the other for my long days at work on my feet.  The shoes are comfortable all around my foot because they have padding and they help absorb the shock of my foot landing and stabilize my gait.  If they don't change the make of the shoe I'll probably buy another pair in a few years because I just cannot find anything else like them",
120231,1,08/27/2017,"Adrenaline GTS 17 Worst shoes ever I work at an assembly plant, I walk up to 10 miles on ergonomic wood 11 hours a night. The first week wearing these they were good. By the end of the  first week of wearing these they flattened out on the inside.  I have Plantar Fasciitis in both of my feet, and I have flat feet. I emailed customer service to get their option on if these would be good for me or not, it took a few weeks for them to get back to me but they confirmed adrenaline was the shoe for me. These are by far the worst shoes I've ever owned. They gave me no support or comfort and feel cheaply made on the inside. There's a big gap from the tongue to the top of your foot too so it feel really weird. I will be returning my shoes, this time I'm going to try Brooks on in store before purchasing from them again.",
120231,5,08/26/2017,This may be my 5th pair of Adrenalines. This is my second pair of dark gray. Please offer more cute colors in wide sizes.,
120231,2,08/26/2017,"Disappointed Please PLEASE bring back the Adrenaline 14s!  They were perfect, and I can't fathom why Brooks designers feel the need to constantly change what is already working.  I wore the 11s and 12s happily, and completely fell in love with the 14s, but since those iterations I have not been able to tolerate the Adrenalines at all.  They are not the same shoe, and if you want to create a new shoe then call it something else and keep the models that people are loving and buying!  For me, the 17s are short, uncomfortably stiff and narrow around the midfoot, with slippage in the heel.  My feet feel hot and painful after a short walk in these shoes.  Ugh. Disappointed again.",
120231,5,08/26/2017,"Love Brooks, have worn them for 16 years. ",
120231,1,08/24/2017,These shoes came apart in 2 weeks of normal wear. Filed a claim inquiry with Brooks. Fail to respond in the timeframe that they stated.,
120231,5,08/23/2017,"Great running shoe I bought this style every year for the past 10 years.  This model has been one of my favorites.  Great cushioning, light weight, not too thick of a sole great for both trail and street.",
120231,5,08/23/2017,"It's the only running shoe I'd buy I have metatarsal problems and the first day I put on the Adrenaline's, I walked 5 miles with absolutely no pressure on my feet. I've never found another shoe that gives the same results. #brooksrunning",
120231,5,08/22/2017,Most Stable I have a bit of an unstable foot placement. This is the only model I will wear...so solid.,
120231,5,08/22/2017,"Best athletic shoe ever! I have long, narrow, flat feet and the fit and support I get from this shoe is outstanding.  Wish they made more than one shoe in narrow width.",
120231,5,08/21/2017,I love these so much that this is mysecond pair in 2 months ,
120231,5,08/21/2017,"Great running shoes! This is a great shoe! I typically run on an elliptical machine, and occasionally outside in my neighborhood. This shoe is perfect for both. It is very lightweight and has lots of cushioning and support. I've tried a few other brands, and even two other Brooks' running shoes, but this one is my favorite. I love this shoe.",
120231,5,08/21/2017,"been in love, still in love please don't ever stop Super comfortable for workouts in the gym, not bulky like some running sneakers.  comfortable for longer runs and feel like my feet are light but supported",
120231,2,08/21/2017,"Pinkie toe blisters! I have bought at least twenty previous pairs of Adrenalines and although the fit changes a bit from year to year, I have always been able to get used to them. This version rubs my pinkie toes and despite 100+ miles on them I'm still getting pinkie toe blisters because of where the reflective piping on the outside lies. This is the first version in years that I won't be buying more of. So sad!",
120231,5,08/20/2017,I love mine! I have an exceptionally high instep. My friend told me to order one size up from my sandals. There perfect with thick socks. My feet haven't gone to sleep and tingled while walking. I love them. 👍,
120231,5,08/20/2017,"But again always I've had the GTS model for five consecutive times now and they're awesome. The only thing is that I feel like they changed the 17s from the 16s a bit more than I expected. The 17s have a shorter toe feel and a high arch support in my opinion. Regardless I love these shoes, but I definitely buy them to see no changes along the line. Run Happy!",
120231,5,08/20/2017,"The fiery Coral color is a great looking shoe! I've been running in Brooks Adrenaline Shoes for a long time. I tried to switch to Asics earlier this year, but found myself needing to go back to Brooks!",
120231,5,08/20/2017,I only wear Brooks Love these shoes. This was first time buying directly from Brooks and was impressed with customer service.,
120231,5,08/19/2017,Favorite shoe of all time Being in an occupation on my feet it's important to have shoes that are comfortable.,
120231,5,08/17/2017,Love the 17!!!!! Love this shoe.   Marathon series are. Must have when you buy new shoes every 3 months!,
120231,1,08/17/2017,"The worst pain after 1 run My foot is still in pain after tonight's 5.5 mile run in the new adrenalines I just bought tonight.  They are very stiff in The toe box, and very loose and move around in the ankle way too much. These will definitely be going back.The ""14"" version was the best version I ever owned. This version was not a winner.",
120231,5,08/15/2017,"Adrenaline GTS 17 I have been wearing the Adrenaline GTS for a couple years now. I love this shoe! Before GTS I had so much pain from plantar fasciitis that I had to get surgery for it. Now I have no problems. This shoe gives me the stability I need, while being light enough for me to run the half marathons that I love! I ran my very first half marathon two weeks after my 60th birthday. Thanks to Brook's Adrenaline GTS! I plan on running many, many more!",
120231,5,08/14/2017,I would buy these again! I loved my first pair of Brooks so I decided to get another pair and I love them!,
120231,5,08/11/2017,I would buu this shoes over and over again. ,
120231,5,08/05/2017,Great 4 running. I only tried them on. Unfortunately I had an ingrown toenail removed and as doctors order I cannot wear closed toe shoes of any kind until Its completely healed. I'm looking forward to wearing them.,
120231,5,08/03/2017,"I'm a Brooks fan for life! I only wear Brooks. Was sold from the 1st pair I ever bought. I bought this pair for my daughter who is having problems from plantar fasciitis. Brooks were at the top of the list, and are helping her. I would recommend Brooks to anyone looking for a great running shoe!",
120231,5,08/03/2017,"Great support I have wide feet and swelling issues. These shoes have exceptional support and flexibility for running and all day walking, without triggering my foot issues.",
120231,5,08/02/2017,Best Adrenaline model yet! I wear these shoes to cross train and to run. This is probably my 6th pair of adrenalines and these are by far my favorite. They feel more streamlined than past models and I love the update on the tongue of the shoe. It's more flush with the top of the shoe and doesn't move around as much as the previous models. These are my absolute favorite shoes ever.,
120231,3,08/01/2017,Predictable I really wish you would create this shoe in some fun colors  like a bright red. Most shoe companies have you beat w their colors and styles. You are very predictable.,
120231,4,07/31/2017,"Great for flat feet! If you need extra cushion and support due to flat feet, this is a great sneaker!",
120231,5,07/28/2017,Great arch support I wear these shoes to provide support for overpronation. I wear a pair every day. I have several pair since I wear them every day.,
120231,1,07/28/2017,Wide is way too narrow I've bought brooks shoes for at least the past 5 years and this is the first time I have been seriously disappointed.  I usually buy the Ariels but they are getting too expensive for my budget so I decided to try these as they said they are still good for over pronators.  I wear an 11 wide in women's and have never had an issue with the fitting of the brooks.  But with the new Adrenaline style my toes are smashed at the end and the width of the shoe is at least and inch or more more narrow than the other wide shoes I have bought in the past.  I will be returning and looking for a new brand.  At these prices we should be getting better quality.,
120231,5,07/25/2017,This is my 5th pair!  Love these shoes! These shoes are so comfortable!  I slip my arch supports into them and I can wear them 24 hours a day.,
120231,5,07/25/2017,Will be definitely buying another pair ,
120231,5,07/25/2017,I would buy three again! Matter fact I did! Love them! There's great support yet enough flexibility in the top. True to size and fit.,
120231,5,07/24/2017,Amazing!! I've been struggling with an ankle injury and these have made my life so much better.  I own a half size smaller as well that I use at work (physical therapist running around the hospital all day).  They provide excellent support.  I also wore these on a trip to London and logged 6 miles a day of walking.  I didn't have any issues with my feet or ankles the entire trip.  Love my Brooks!!,
120231,5,07/24/2017,Adrenaline Loyal ,
120231,2,07/24/2017,Different from my last pair The bottom of the shoe feels harder. I had to buy separate inserts to try and cushion it. Still hurting. The last pair I had did not bother the bottom of my feet but these do,
120231,5,07/24/2017,Definitely buy again. ,
120231,5,07/24/2017,They feel great and look great. I am completely satisfied with the fit and feel and appearance of this footwear!,
120231,5,07/22/2017,Best shoe out there! ,
120231,5,07/21/2017,We just love our Brooks ,
120231,4,07/20/2017,"I like Brooks One weird thing... I have worn Brooks for 2010, recommended by physical therapy.  Always fit great... this pair is weird, the left foot is superb; but the right feels like the arch is towards the back not the middle or where it belongs.",
120231,5,07/20/2017,This Color Makes Me Happy I LOVE these shoes. I smile every time I put these shoes on. Thank you Brooks for making such a quality shoe.,
120231,5,07/20/2017,Best running shoes I've ever owned! ,
120231,5,07/18/2017,"Perfect This is my second pair of Brooks, so I did know which size to order, but this time was able to choose the wide fit which is even better for me.  Immediately wearable, I love them.",
120231,5,07/15/2017,"Great Running Shoes for My Plantar Fasciitis! As someone who deals with continual heel pain and plantar fasciitis, I was led to Brooks by an outside internet article that ranked running shoes for foot problems like mine.  I wasn't disappointed!  I'm just now getting back into the fitness & running game.  These shoes keep my feet aligned, and I don't nearly have the post-running pain I used to have.",
120231,5,07/13/2017,"Love and want more! I run 3-4 times/week up to 3 miles, so not too far, but as someone who suffers from chronic ankle stability these shoes give me support like no other and also offer an extra spring in my step that I've never experienced before. This was my first pair of Brooks and I gotta say, I'm hooked!",
120231,2,07/12/2017,"Removed firmness from the shoe for 2017 I have been running in the Adrenaline for over 6 years. I am really sad about this new model for 2017. Brooks has removed the firm cardboard base in the shoe, and replaced it with more cushion. Now it feels like any other brand of cushioned shoe. This has caused me to have less response from the shoe, and achy lower legs after a run. I am now on the search for a new go-to shoe.",
120231,1,07/10/2017,"GTS 17--NO!   GTS 16  YES!  In a heartbeat!!! Gts 17 was comfy only the first couple of runs.   It felt 'hard' and  'broken down' with only 25 miles on them.  With 80 miles on them my legs hurt.   I'm 5'4 and 130, 57 year old fit female.    I LOVED  the GTS 16 and just bought another pair, thankfully they were available.     I do NOT recommend the gts 17s     I DO recommend the 16's.....Brooks... if it ain't broke, don't fix it!",
120231,4,07/08/2017,I would buy this again The left shoe is good but I feel the right shoe was cut short. I have worn Brooks for a long time and this is the first pair that I have had a fit issue with,
120231,5,07/06/2017,"Love these shoes! Love these shoes so much that I bought one for my job as a nurse (my feet feel good during 13 hr shifts!!) and life in general. Every time I put them on my feet it's like my feet sigh with relief hah! But, really, they are amazingly comfortable and supportive shoes! I got the paint splatter looking shoes and love them! I have gotten so many compliments!",
120231,4,07/06/2017,"My go-to shoe! I love this shoe and have for many years.  This model is getting back to earlier model comfort and design.  As the new models are released, it does feel like they are getting slightly smaller in size.  Might be a manufacturing issue.",
120231,5,07/06/2017,I would buy this shoe again.  I think this is my sixth pair. ,
120231,5,07/06/2017,"Would buy a 2nd pair! I bought one size bigger than my normal size. I've only had these shoes a few days, but I already love them for my running. These shoes have great support... I would highly recommend for anyone with flat feet or who tends to walk with their ankles rolled in or out. I have poor form and these shoes have helped me to run correctly and more efficiently!",
120231,5,07/05/2017,Great!! ,
120231,4,07/05/2017,"Not my favorite Adrenaline, but still a great shoe. The GTS 17 feels a bit less supportive than the previous versions; however, I love the fabric of this shoe. It really hugs my feet in the right places and they feel a bit lighter. Maybe that is why they also feel slightly less supportive?They are also a bit more narrow in the toe box - at least it feels that way.",
120231,5,07/05/2017,Too Cute.... ,
120231,1,07/03/2017,Horrible Shoe My shoes are not the same! The left shoe has a shorter tongue length and the right shoe causes bruising on the top of my foot. I am not please at all and will switch back to Asics.,
120231,5,07/03/2017,"My third pair, but not the last After wearing out two pairs of the Adrenaline GTS 16, I switched to the Adrenaline GTS 17.  I rack up over 10K steps a day in these shoes.  They feel great and accommodate the custom orthotics I have to wear.  Sometimes the colors seem a bit garish for me, but the charcoal of this latest pair is perfect.",
120231,5,07/03/2017,I will buy this shoe every year. ,
120231,2,07/03/2017,"These hurt my feet I've worn this style in the past, however this version really hurt my feet. I walk a lot at work and by the end of the day I literally had to take them off. My heels were sore for days after wearing these shoes. I am very dissatisfied with them:(",
120231,4,07/02/2017,I would buy again but:: I feel like the right shoe was cut a little too short-left shoe is fine-have never had this issue with Brooks before,
120231,2,07/01/2017,"5th pair of Adrenaline and DO NOT like this pair! I am a repeat customer of the adrenaline, but there's something off with this particular pair. They do not fit me right. My socks slide down into my shoe. I cannot lace them tight enough to feel secure. The bottoms are thicker. I actually ended up wearing my old pair to the gym yesterday and they are completely worn out, but these new ones are not right. What happened to the shoe that I love so much??",
120231,4,06/30/2017,Love 'em ,
120231,5,06/30/2017,"Great shoe Great shoe, fits well, very comfy, no break in period, great support, put them on and go, I wear them for everyday and walking, shopping, etc,",
120231,4,06/29/2017,"Good product Wishing I had tried the larger size but not knowing how the sizing would fit me, I went with my regular size. Next time I'll know! ;)",
120231,3,06/28/2017,"The Adrenaline 16s offer greater support. The new version Adrenaline 17 much softer with less stability for overpronators compared to the 16s. The 16s, while stiff at first, broke in to the perfect stability shoe. Bring it back.",
120231,5,06/28/2017,"Love this shoe! I have been running in the Brooks Adrenaline for several years now.  It's by far the most comfortable shoe and wears very well. Comfortable from the day you take them out of the box. With all the little tweaks from year to year, I feel the GTS 17 is my favorite. Don't change a thing Brooks!! ♥️",
120231,5,06/28/2017,"Love these shoes, will buy again!! Shoes are very comfortable and provides excellent support. I'm very happy with my purchase.",
120231,5,06/27/2017,"Always great Adrenaline Adrenaline continues to be a supportive, comfortable, durable shoe. Love them and will continue ordering each time a pair wears out (after several hundred miles!)",
120231,5,06/27/2017,Awesome! No need to break them in for vacation.  They are so comfy right out of the box!,
120231,5,06/26/2017,I can work on my feet all day long now with no pain I found my shoe forever... its the best shoe I have ever had. I work on my feet all day in a Orthopedic clinic and I usually have no problem with foot gear. For the last 3 years I have not been able to find a shoe that fits right or feels good. The GTS fits all my needs and I can stay up on my feet all day. Thank you for the great shoe and durability.,
120231,5,06/26/2017,Love Love these more than my GTS 16s.  I have semi narrow feet and they fit perfectly. Super comfortable. Will continue to buy again and again,
120231,5,06/25/2017,Love this shoe Love these shoes.  They are my go to shoes and never disappoint!  Love the styles too.,
120231,2,06/23/2017,"Different fit than 16 I absolutely loved my Adrenaline 16's. I was having major foot problems, cramping, stiffness, and constant discomfort. My friend recommended the Adrenalines and boy oh boy. I put my Adrenaline 16's on and knew from the jump they were special. Immediately all my foot discomfort was gone. I was able to workout more/harder and took full advantage because I was pain free. I do a mixture of HIIT, kickboxing, running, weights. They were great for all my activities. Couldn't believe it! After a month or so the bottoms of the shoes (black rubber) started separating from the sides of the shoe. So, sometimes when I would lean or jump side to side I would sort of trip over the rubber. I contacted Brooks customer service and after sending pictures they immediately offered to replace my shoes. However, they only had the 17's available. I went with my same size 9 and was stoked to get my 17's. *Sigh* They seem at least a half size smaller and not nearly as heavenly-perfect as my 16's. My foot ailments have returned and have now worsened into calf cramps/knee issues. I was so excited, I thought I had found my perfect shoe. But the 17's just don't do it for me. I HATE it when companies mess up a good thing. Just make the same wonderful product we all love in different colors. *Sigh*",
120231,5,06/22/2017,I am going to buy another pair because I love them so much! Love these shoes!  They might run a tad smaller than other running shoes but they're great!,
120231,1,06/21/2017,"What happened?  Why not stick with the GTS 15 shoe? I had finally found a running shoe in the GTS 15, which didn't cause a single ache or pain.  Then I bought the 16 model, and it was like a different shoe, which I couldn't wear.  Brooks was kind enough to exchange it for the 17 model, which I figured would be better, but the pain was worse!  I can understand updating the outside of a shoe, but why on earth would you take an award winning shoe and completely change the feel of it?  I am still wearing my 15 model, but need another pair of shoes to run in, so will have to find another brand because I cannot locate the GTS 15 (now they are a hot commodity, selling for like $150 + online).  Had I known, I would have bought five pairs : (",
120231,2,06/21/2017,"Liked them at first, but toe box is too small for me I've been using these for running ~2 miles 3-4 times a week for the last couple of weeks.  I have been having some issues with the toe box on my left foot (which is slightly larger than my right) rubbing on my toes.  I initially thought it was possibly because of the dress shoes that I had been wearing, but have concluded that in fact the running shoes are just a bit too small.  Which is a bit surprising because I am usually between a 7.5 and an 8 and I ordered the 8 which in many shoes is borderline too big.",
120231,5,06/21/2017,"My knees say ""Thank you!"" As I hit my 40s, my knees increasingly hurt after a run.  After searching for shoes made for runners, I purchased these, and barely feel a twinge after running.  (Sighs with relief)  I thought I was going to have to hang up the running shoes.  They hug my feet and feel wonderful, even after the last lap!  My only issue was when I had callous on my toe, the inside bottom sole felt a little hard and painful - remedied with a band aid.",
120231,4,06/21/2017,"Love them!  So much better than buying from a store! I need to have a lot of cushion when I'm running & these are great!  Little wide in the toe area so it looks like I have duck feet, but gives my toes plenty of breathing room.  Very comfortable on both short & long runs...",
120231,1,06/20/2017,"Really wanted to love these I started running 4 years ago and have been wearing Adrenalines from the beginning. I loved the 14s and 16s, and was able to make due with the 15s, though they weren't the best. I ordered a pair of the 17s in the same size and they fit and felt fine when I tried them on. However, after less than 2 miles of running, I got horrible blisters on the inside of my arches due to what I think is the stitching on the inside of the shoe. I tried to break them in thinking that it would improve, but the blisters just kept coming back. Luckily, Brooks has a great return policy and I was able to return them and order another pair of the 16s. I'm really hoping the 18 model will be closer to what the 14s were, because I really have loved this shoe.",
120231,3,06/20/2017,"These shoes run HUGE in Extra Wide I ordered this shoe to try something that LOOKED better than the icky color of the Ariels...I have a wide foot and need the 2E in ariels....Was shocked to see that these shoes are monsters in the 2E size...My length is a bit big too...I should have sent them back, but needed a shoe for vacation...and these are a bust....I keep wondering if they mixed them up with MEN's sizing or something.....Unusally OFF in their sizing and compared to other brooks I've purchased for years.....Again, BROOKS needs to support wide feet and heavier walkers/runners....GET SOME NEW COLORS for The ARIEL....",
120231,5,06/19/2017,Love these shoes ! ,
120231,5,06/19/2017,"Love the stability! I have very unstable ankles and have trouble finding running shoes with enough stability without feeling totally weighed down. However, these shoes do it for me. I have had previous editions of this shoe, but these were even easier to break in during my first run. I absolutely love the stability and cushion they provide for my long road runs. I do wish that there were more color options however.",
120231,4,06/18/2017,Love these shoes I love these shoes. Most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned in a long time. Normally I buy some and within a week my feet hurt so bad that I need to stop wearing them. That hasn't happened yet. And I've had them for 2+weeks.,
120231,3,06/18/2017,Wish I had purchased transcends Like color but they have no cushion the back of heel is knotting up when I get home from work on my feet all day I am sore all over. I liked my transcend better. They do keep my arches up,
120231,5,06/17/2017,Love my new shoes and have always loved Brooks. ,
120231,5,06/16/2017,"Buy multiple pairs, awesome shoe 😊 I walk/run 40-60 miles a week and this shoe has been the solution to my heel and knee pain.  I have stocked up and have happy feet.  Thanks Brooks👍",
120231,5,06/16/2017,"So Light! I really love these shoes! They are so light compared to my old ones that I felt like I was almost flying in them on my first run! They are a bit narrow for me, and they are a tad smaller than others. I'd likely get a half size bigger next time but I wonder if that would be too much too. Either way, I broke them in, which helped with the narrowness and I really enjoy running with these. I'd buy them again!",
120231,5,06/16/2017,"So comfortable Great shoe, reminded me that I need to rotate out my running shoes more often.  They feel so comfortable.",
120231,5,06/15/2017,I would buy this product again Have always just been able to put a pair of brooks on and wear them without having any issues such as rubbing my foot someplace. Do have to order a size larger than I normally wear.,
120231,5,06/15/2017,This is my favorite Brooks Athletic Shoes. ,
120231,5,06/14/2017,Love these shoes I've never known what it is to workout with actual running/athletic shoes until now. It makes a world of difference and is deffinitely worth the price. I would absolutely buy again and may actually buy another pair (one to leave at my gym and one for home). Great purchase!!!,
120231,5,06/14/2017,My 8th or 9th generation of Adrenaline GTS ,
120231,5,06/11/2017,"Happy Narrow Feet I wear a 9N in street shoes and the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17 fits perfectly.  It is so difficult to find a narrow running shoe!  My foot doesn't really pronate, but this shoe still feels good.  Thank you for making a quality product in narrow width.",
120231,5,06/10/2017,"Best GTS, and the best shoe in general! Buy these shoes right now!!!I've been a loyal Brooks fan for the past six years. I have been wearing the GTS line for about four of those years. Normally, there hasn't been much chance between each new model of shoes. However, with this model, there were major amazing changes, from it more lightweight, so it feels more responsive and fast, rather than lugging around awkward bricks; to a more comfortable heel and forefoot structure. I almost cried when I took these on a run the first time, because they were absolutely perfect. If I had the money, I would buy a million of these shoes so I would always have the perfect running shoes. Good job Brooks!!!!",
120231,5,06/09/2017,"I love these shoes. Definitely buy again I wear these shoes everyday for work, constantly walking and on my feet for 10 to 12 hours a day. Excellent shoes so far",
120231,4,06/08/2017,Loved the shoe ,
120231,5,06/05/2017,I have bought this product multiple time and I love it! ,
120231,5,06/04/2017,"Took me 12 years to buy another pair of GTS... The last pair of GTS I has was back in 2005. It took me this long to get another pair because I didn't like the color selections. By the time I broke down and ordered anther pair, the sizing had changed. My GTS 5 were size 6 medium width. However, for the GTS 17, I had to order size 6.5 wide width.",
120231,4,06/04/2017,"Offers great support and cushion I use the shoe for frequent indoor high intensity interval training and less frequent outdoor running, so it's a good all-around usage shoe. It's hard to find shoes in my width (2E), but this shoe has a comfortable width, weight, support, and cushion even with rigorous training. The color scheme I got wasn't bad, but there was only one color option for 2E widths, and I just wish that more colors had wider width options, too!",
120231,3,06/01/2017,Adrenaline required Shoes are better for outdoor walking.  They felt heavy when running on a treadmill. Liked the black on black design.,
120231,1,06/01/2017,"What happened? I thought I'd found my shoe with the GTS Adrenaline 15, but then ordered the GTS 16, and it was so hard, and uncomfortable, like a different shoe.  Brooks was kind enough to exchange for the GTS 17, but unfortunately, it was worse.  Yes, it has a lot of cushion, but that doesn't help if you are saddled with knee, shin, pain, and foot pain from lack of arch support.  I'm wondering how an award winning shoe in the 15 model can go to this?  Bottom line, I cannot wear either the GTS 16 nor the 17.",
120231,5,05/31/2017,"aptly named the go to shoe These shoes carried me through my entire half marathon training cycle + the race itself and beyond. I have now run in these shoes 10-30 miles a week for 5 months and they are still in great condition. The top and sides of the shoes still look brand new. You can only see wear on the treads, which is to be expected after roughly 400 miles. These shoes have carried my over-pronating, flat feet safely and comfortable through each mile. Love these shoes!",
120231,5,05/30/2017,"Keep the roomy toe box, the perfect shoe is perfect again! I was having a hard time in some previous version with teh small toe box.  The net mesh on top of the shoe wasn't lasting long because my toe would rub up against it...also, it simply wasn't comfortable.  These are my best pair yet.  I wear a pair at work everyday (all black) and have these new cactus purple ones for running and the gym.  I love them, thanks!",
120231,4,05/30/2017,Maybe not broken in enough! I wore this shoe for 2 runs before wearing it for my 10k and they seemed fine.  However I got a blister on my arch of my right foot during my race.  I have fallen arches so I need a shoe with a high arch.  I had last year's version of this shoe so I figured getting the new version would be the same.  I have never had a blister on my arch from any of my brook shoes. Not sure what happened!  Other than that very happy with the shoe!,
120231,5,05/29/2017,Finally!!!! I have been looking for shoes to replace the Gel Kayanos after they changed their sizing and I have finally found them!  These shoes run a half size small (I normally wear a 9.5 and had to size up to a 10).  I am very glad these come in wide because it provides more room in the toe box.  I wish there were more options in the wide sizes but otherwise a well fitting and comfortable shoe.,
120231,4,05/26/2017,They are working out fine I picked this shoe because I didn't like the color offered for the Addiction. I will go back to Addiction when they get a different color.,
120231,5,05/24/2017,Love Brooks! ,
120231,5,05/22/2017,"Best shoe for me!!! I have bought these shoes for years. I've tried others but always go back. They are long lasting and give me the support I need for my pronation! Please don't change the model of the GTS, I'd be lost looking for anything better.",
120231,3,05/18/2017,"Not what I expected I have been trying to be more active & walk/hike more.  Was in the market for a good supportive shoe.  Have always heard good things about Brooks shoes, so decided to give them a try.  I have arthritis or a stiff big toe on my right foot.  I purchased the Brooks Adrenaline 17.  I was very disappointed in the lack of flexibility, although the support is very good, so maybe that is the rationale.  My poor toe hurts too bad in these shoes to warrant the price, so they are definitely going back.  They seem well made otherwise, Not much cushion in my opinion, not enough comfort elsewhere to make things any better.  So I am going back to my old favorite, Asics.  Thankful for the 90 day return policy, That makes Brooks a winning company alone.",
120231,5,05/17/2017,"Great design year! I have been wearing Brooks Adrenaline as my primary running shoe, especially for long distance, for the past 5 years. My favorite year was the '14, but this one comes in at a close second. Finally! I feel like the foot box is a little more nimble than in recent years and not as boxy. The fit is great as is the support- though I wear Sole inserts with them. I strongly recommend them and enjoy the galaxy design.",
120231,5,05/15/2017,"4 years straight of Adrenaline Love Since I started running 4 years ago I only wear Brooks Adrenline.  In 16 you narrowed the toe bed of the shoe which really hurt, literally.  So I had to go to a wide.   In 17 had to stay with the wide also.  Loved all the color options for regular shoes but the choices for the wide shoes was very disappointing.  I got my brooks and love them and will always tell people to get Brooks.  Just wish I had more fun options in the wide.",
120231,5,05/13/2017,"Best pair of shoes my feet have ever felt! Right now I am wearing these to work as I am a physical therapist and am on my feet all day. I'm also wearing these for my ""long"" runs at the gym. I am a crossfitter, so I wear these for anything over a 400m run. I will also wear these for any interval running at the gym. No other shoe compares to the stability that Brooks provides. Many crossfitters are wearing Reebok Nano's or Nike Metcons, which do not provide enough support for the many functional movements we do at the gym... box jumps, jump rope, etc. Thanks for making a great pair of shoes!",
120231,5,05/12/2017,"New & improved The adrenaline series has been my ""go to"" shoe for a decade.  I like the way is hugs my foot and has good arch support.  I especially like that the exterior has improved--material is less porous.",
120231,5,05/12/2017,"This is my 3rd pair in 4 years and love them!!! I absolutely love the Adrenaline GTS, they were comfortable when I run long distance and when I go to the gym.  The best fit and comfort!!",
120231,2,05/09/2017,"I am downgrading my opinion I previously purchased two pair of Adrenaline GTS 17 running shoe, one in a size 10 (which fit my size 10 foot just fine) and a size 10.5 (which turned out to be slightly too large).  I wear a size 10 pretty universally.I liked the shoe so much that I have now ordered a third pair--another size 10.  Unfortunately, this pair of size 10s is a full size too small.  I look like Cinderella's step-sister when I try to jam my foot into the shoe.Apparently Brooks has quality control issues pertaining to sizing.  If you read the reviews, you'll find that some say the shoes fit true to size, while others say they're one-half to a full size too small.  I guess it just depends on the pair that you happen to get.I like these shoes, but I would buy them only if I were able to try them on first.  I won't waste my time with any further online ordering.Additionally, Brooks is behind the times when it comes to giving refunds.  Other retailers refund your money as soon as they receive notification from UPS or USPS, etc., that the returned package has been received by the shipping company.  Not Brooks.  They've let me know that they've received notice from the USPS that the returned shoes have been received by the USPS, but say it will be 2-3 WEEKS before they can refund my money.  I say baloney.  There's no reason for them not to refund my money immediately.  All in all, I'm most disappointed in this purchase, both in the product and in the customer service.  Too bad, because I do like the shoes--and that's the only reason that I gave them a couple of stars.  Otherwise, I would have given them zero stars.",
120231,5,05/05/2017,"Comfortable, Supportive and Stylish ! I do a boot camp 5 times a week. These running shoes are comfortable, supportive and can withstand the daily abuse without losing there stability and support.  Love them!",
120231,2,05/04/2017,"Not as comfortable as style used to be. I bought this shoe twice in years past and loved the comfortable feeling. This pair feels too narrow. I have a bunion and it is difficult to buy comfortable shoes, but the pairs I bought over the past few years have felt great. I was disappointed that a size 7W and then a size 7.5W still was not comfortable. I may go to a store where I can try on other styles and not inconvenience Brooks with returns, though I really appreciate the return policy.",
120231,5,05/03/2017,Great fit & comfort ,
120231,1,05/02/2017,"Didn't Work for Me I switched from Asics because they changed their shoes (after loving them for years!).  I have many friends who use and recommend Brooks. I had to sit out of any exercise for over a week after wearing them.  My knees and back were killing me. I can't explain why they did not work nor can I explain the weird fit. I do appreciate the return policy Brooks has, however.",
120231,5,04/29/2017,I only wear Brooks  for work & fun ,
120231,4,04/29/2017,Comfortable but not as comfy as my other Brooks They are very comfortable to a point.  I wore them all day last weekend sight seeing and by the end of the day the balls of my feet were a little tender.  I have other Brooks that don't do this.  This was the first time I tried this style.  I am still happy with them but will have to wear another pair the next time I walk for 8 hours on concrete and brick.  I would still buy again.,
120231,2,04/28/2017,For the price your shoes are not good The last 2 pairs had holes in the toe within 1 month and look shabby. These are looking shabby already. Yes they fit and feel good but the wear is ridiculously awful. Not worth the money,
120231,3,04/26/2017,Guitar Print is cool.. But seems lower in quality I'm pretty worried about the durability of these shoes. Near the front of the foot it's as if the shoe was giving out around toe area.. It's wrinkling all around that area as I walk. The quality is lower than expected and the material used for the (rather awesome-looking) guitars is squishy. I hope they hold up.. They have already easily scuffed from a few outdoor treks as if the green part is really cheaply made. Such a bummer because I loooove this shoe. Not much cushion either for some reason... Seems equal to my old ones from last year which I wore over 500 miles.,
120231,1,04/25/2017,"Yuck! I have run in Adrenaline's for the last 2 years. I liked the 15's and the 16's were the best shoes I have ever run in. I just got the 17's and HATE them. Had to take back the size 8 I normally wear, as this shoe runs big. The 7 1/2 was uncomfortable. I pads of my feet were numb by the end of my 10 mile run. Might work for some, but NOT the shoe for me any more. Very disappointed. :(",
120231,4,04/25/2017,"Love this shoe! I love this shoe, but did have to return and reorder a 1/2 size bigger than I normally wear.",
120231,3,04/25/2017,"Feels slightly smaller than last year's model Good solid shoe as usual, but they feel slightly smaller than last year's. I put custom orthotics in my shoes, and these shoes just are not as comfortable as the 16 version. They feel tight on the sides.",
120231,5,04/24/2017,She loves them! My sister just had a baby and i got her these as a gift. She was getting shin splints and these shoes have now helped her with it. She really loves the feel and look.,
120231,2,04/23/2017,Love the shoes but had to return them. Color is too loud! ,
120231,5,04/23/2017,Love my new shoes I was told runs half a size too smal which was true . Great support and cushion . Love my new shoes .,
120231,5,04/22/2017,"Best running shoe on market! I train for marathons. About two years ago, I was sidelined with a hairline fracture. It was determine that it was because I pronated as I ran. Brooks GTS was the only shoe that made me feel great as I ran and have had zero injuries since switching to this shoe. I'll never run in another shoe again!",
120231,3,04/20/2017,"Very comfortable. I use it for the gym. I often walk around the neighborhood in sidewalks and streets. Light jogging. Love these shoes. They have comfortable cushioning and are very pretty. BUT, I bought them wide. They still felt like normal width to me. True fit would have been extra wide,  but this exact size and color was not available. Also, the inside front seams are a little rough on the big and small toes.  Aside from them feeling narrow, they are overall very comfortable.",
120231,5,04/20/2017,"Using this shoe for 6 years Very good shoe that I have bought for over 6 years and will continue buying. I run 4-5 times a week, sometimes alternating between pairs, and this shoe will last me 6-7 months depending on the amount of rough trails and distance I put in.",
120231,4,04/20/2017,"they hug my foot like a glove I'm too old to run but I use these for walking the dog.  They are supportive and very comfy.  I just wish the bottoms would last longer.  I walk on asphalt and sidewalks and they really wear out too quickly.  For the price, I expect the shoe to last longer.",
120231,5,04/18/2017,"Love these shoes I have a very, very wide foot, and have flat feet, I suffer from a heel spur also. Wearing these shoes is wonderful, I can actually walk at the end of my shift, I use for work and am on my feet for 8 hrs., So, I hope I can purchase again, without them being unavailable, that would be sad! Overall, wish they could be a tad wider, but, I already get the widest Brooks offer?!",
120231,4,04/18/2017,"decent shoe I ushally buy the glycerins, was looking for something a little cheaper and more attractive. So far these shoes are ok, no major complaints, comfy and cute.",
120231,4,04/18/2017,Nursing Relief I am a nurse and standing on hard floors all day is a given. Brooks are my go to shoe for work. Not enough arch support so I could not give 5 stars,
120231,5,04/17/2017,"I would definitely buy this product again! I walk a lot and go to the gym 4-5 days a week and these are my ""go to"" pair!!",
120231,4,04/17/2017,"The only shoe for me I have bad feet so I wear my Brooks all the time. They'll ruin a cute outfit in a heart beat but it is what it is. I personally could use a little more cushion. I also need to replace them every 5-7 months. They're not exactly cheap so I wish they lasted a little longer. All that being said, I've tried other shoes and I wouldn't wear anything else.   I was a thin, fit gym rat for 10 years I wore Brooks adrenaline then. I'm a tired, overweight mom now and I still prefer Brooks Adrenaline to any other shoe. So no matter what you're doing these days I think it's a good choice. Definitely worth a try anyway.",
120231,5,04/17/2017,Loving these shoes! ,
120231,5,04/17/2017,"Love them! I just got these and I've run in them 2x. They are light, comfortable and easy to wear. I do have orthotics in them.",
120231,4,04/16/2017,All black is what I needed. ,
120231,5,04/16/2017,"Would buy again, I have purchased 4 pairs so far. Great for work.  I'm a nurse and I last a 12 hour shift without a problem.  Great color selection too.",
120231,5,04/15/2017,"I will buy more of these I am not a runner and therefore do not use this shoe for running.  I love it, though, for walking and for everyday wear.  I pronate pretty badly.  I wear this shoe with my custom, full-length orthotic.  My feet are nearly pain-free for the first time in many years.  This shoe has a roomy toe box, both in width and in height.  I wear a ladies' size 10M in virtually every shoe known to man.  I bought two pairs of this shoe, one in a size 10, and the other in a size 10.5.  The 10.5 is a smidge too big, and the 10 is the tiniest smidge too small.  What would be perfect for me would be a size 10.25.  :)   I would imagine that when you run, you feet swell, so if you use these shoes for running, I would recommend going up one-half size.  If, like me, you use them for general everyday wear, you'll likely be fine with your regular size.",
120231,5,04/14/2017,"My favorite workout, walking, running, and work sneaker! I love this sneaker! I buy them in pairs of two. One pair for work, I am a registered nurse and work 12 hour shifts, and one pair for working out. These sneakers have helped heal my plantar fasciitis. I recommend them to all my friends and co-workers.",
120231,5,04/14/2017,Love them I love Adrenaline's. I don't ever depart because they provide me with the most support and feel the best,
120231,5,04/13/2017,"These are my favorite shoes! Love them! I love this shoe because I wear it for work on a concrete floor. I also walk for fitness 30-40 min a day and they hold up great for that. I need a new pair every 4-6 months for both activities. My back, hips, knees and feet are much less fatigued and don't get sore like they would in other running shoes I have tried.",
120231,5,04/13/2017,Best company and shoes in the running world. Exceptional!!! I am a long distance runner and pharmacist. I am on my feet for 10 hour shifts and run 7 to 8 miles 5 days a week. These are the only shoes that don't make my legs ache or feel tired. I love these!!!,
120231,5,04/13/2017,"Absolutely LOVE them! I have one knee replacement, and am about to have another one done. These are the best, most supportive shoes I have owned yet, and make my knee discomfort more minimal.",

120231,5,04/11/2017,My Guitar Brooks ROCK!! These special Brooks were made for the Rock n Roll series marathons.  THEY ARE AWESOME!  The first time I wore them people were checking them out saying how cool they are!,
120231,5,04/11/2017,Improved cushioning ,
120231,4,04/11/2017,Will continue to buy Brooks. Great Shoe. ,
120231,5,04/10/2017,"Awesome running shoes! These shoes have been great, didn't really have to break them in. Very comfortable! I have flat feet and these have great arch support, plus the shoes are lighter weight which some can be heavier with more support.",
120231,5,04/09/2017,I would buy this product again. I love Brooks shoes haven't purchased any other brand since I started wearing Brooks and have referred to family and friends!,
120231,5,04/08/2017,LOVE THEM!! These are my second pair of Adrenaline GTS shoes. They give me great support no matter what my workout is. I mainly run or walk and these are prefect for that!! I will continue to wear these shoes as long as they are made.,
120231,2,04/05/2017,"Disappointing and painful! As soon as I put these on my feet, I knew with 99.9% certainty that I'd need to return them. They are quite stiff out of the box and to me feel narrow in the toes and about 1/2 to 1 size too small. I wore them around the house for awhile while I was doing some chores and then sitting on the couch and they made my arches ache. I decided to give them a try outside and wore them out briefly to go somewhere. Just wearing them for like 20-30 min while not exercising, my big right toe went numb and my arches were aching again. The only positive thing I can say about this shoe is that it offers a lot of support. Sadly sending these back today. This shoe has great reviews from all the running sites, so maybe it's just my feet? I think I need a more neutral/ cushioned shoe after all. Back to the drawing board!",

120231,1,04/05/2017,"Dissapointed I have been buying and wearing brooks for ten years, the last 2 pairs (this one the most current) have literally fallen apart after 6-8 months of wear. The mesh has holes in it and the bottom of the shoe is a trip hazard. I bought my husband a mens pair and they did the same thing. I will order one more pair of Brooks, a different style and if I have the same problem, they will lose me as a customer forever.",
120231,5,04/05/2017,Excellent Stability! ,
120231,5,04/05/2017,My feet are in love! This shoe has excellent cushion impact. I had surgery on my heel a year ago and it's still tender. This shoes has made a world of difference and feels great on my heel while absorbing the pounding on my heel. I can run longer and faster after wearing the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17.,
120231,5,04/04/2017,I will definitely buy this product again. ,
120231,4,04/02/2017,"Great shoe! I like this shoe. I have been trail running in the Glycerins for years now and needed a new pair of everyday walking shoes. I was also experiencing a high level of pain in my Achilles tendon. So instead of getting the $40.00 pair of Nikes from the grocery store I decided to treat my feet and get a pair of Brooks. The only problem was that I needed them to be black because I needed them to go with my everyday clothes. This shoe was the only one that came in black that had the support that I was looking for. Thankfully though it worked out alright. My feet still hurt when I am on them for 8+ hours at a time while wearing these shoes, buy my Achilles tendon is not at tight as it was before. So, overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",
120231,5,04/01/2017,"I love these shoes - I don't want them to ever wear out! This shoe hits the perfect balance between providing good support, and not feeling cramped or uncomfortable.",
120231,5,03/31/2017,DEFINITELY COMING BACK I got these shoes for work and they are by far the best work shoes I have purchased! These shoes are super comfortable and also provide the proper support I need while im on my feet all day at work.,
120231,5,03/31/2017,Really comfortable Wow! these were comfortable the minute I put them on!  did not use my orthotics because they were so comfortable. I especially liked the elastic-type shoestrings because there is no need to double knot them to keep them from untying. A big plus!,
120231,5,03/30/2017,I love these but only two colors available in wide width I would buy many more pairs if there were more colors in the wide width. I have wide toe area and narrower heel with high arches and these are the best fitting and supportive tennis shoes I have found.,
120231,5,03/28/2017,LOVE BROOKS ,
120231,1,03/27/2017,"I would not buy nor recommend the Adrenaline GTX 17 ever. I wore the newly purchased shoes from two weeks ago to run the Encinitas Half Marathon on Sunday March 26th.  Based on my past experience with the Adrenaline and Hurricane models I didn't think two week old shoes would give me such a problem. Nevertheless, at around mile 5 my foot started to cramp up. I thought maybe the shoe was laced to tight so I stopped and adjusted the shoe lacing and pushed onward. By mile 11 my foot started to cramp and the back of my heels were hurting so much so that I had no more push to give. So I ended up having to walk the last two miles of the race, which was quite painful since mile 12 had a steep hill. It was the worst experience I've ever had at a race. I couldn't even bare the pain to run through the finish line. I have never been this disappointed in a shoe. I placed the shoe in the return box and they are on their way back to Brooks. Not sure any of your other customers have had the experience that I had but you may want to take a second look at the construction of the shoe.  Thank youAngela Wright",
120231,5,03/27/2017,"Literally purchasing my next pair already, I love them These have provided my feet with a sense of stability I never had before.  I had pronation issues prior to the Adrenaline 17s, I can say that I have no plantar fascia pain, and I have been able to endure workouts with minimal pain. Coming off of two knee surgeries, a stability shoe was imperative to my success and comfort as a new runner, and I am happy I found a shoe that loves me back!",
120231,5,03/27/2017,17's are way better than 16's I'm training for my second full marathon and have already put 75 miles on my shoes. They broke in quickly and easily. They are far more comfortable than the GTS 16's.,
120231,5,03/26/2017,I would buy this product again I love your sneakers!! They are colorful....stylish and most of all very supportive and comfortable!!,
120231,5,03/26/2017,I would buy again I would like to see double wide in a summer hiking shoes.  A lighter shoe for the summer with good transaction.,
120231,5,03/25/2017,"GTS 17 Best Adrenaline Yet I've been running in the Brooks Adrenaline for over 7 years. The GTS 17 is the best Adrenaline yet. My favorite every year is the special edition Adrenaline as they are made of a tighter weave fabric great for all-weather running and the fun graphics inspire me to go further. Before I discovered the Adrenaline, I was prone to plantar fasciitis in other running shoe brands. Once I changed to the Adrenaline I have never had an injury since. If you are a runner like me with moderate pronation who runs 25+ miles a week and wants a comfortable yet supportive running shoe, I highly recommend trying the Adrenaline. Keep up the good work Brooks! Keep making more fun print and color combos for those of us who like to Run Happy!",
120231,5,03/25/2017,Great shoe! Great running shoe that took no time to break in. Tried another shoe prior to getting these that were not Brooks and regretted it. For as long as I am running I will be buying these shoes!,
120231,5,03/24/2017,3rd Pair Now! This is my third generation of the Adrenaline GTS. I may never switch running shoes because I love them so much! I mostly use them for long-distance running and gym work-outs. The occasional trail run - but I would recommend a specific trail running shoe over the Adrenaline.,
120231,2,03/24/2017,"Hurts to wear I fell in love with the Ghost 8's last year. But realized that for long runs I needed a wider toe box. The local running store didn't have wide fit so I researched and found these Adrenaline 17. I have been wearing them for a month now and they still feel brand new, so stiff and uncomfortable. I figured it was just that they needed to broken in. I run an average of 30 miles a week, and after 2 miles the arch is hurting. The padding under my forefoot also hurts and it feels like I have no cushioning because it's so hard. The wide fit is perfect for my foot though especially on long runs because my feet swell up after an hour.",
120231,4,03/22/2017,"Pretty good product Overall, a great shoe. I bought these after having worn my Ariels for 2 years and needing new sneakers. They fit about half a size to big, but overall they aren't to bad. They are very lightweight which is great because I will be doing a lot of running in them. I will likely still have to repurchase a pair of the Ariels to accommodate my daily wear needs, and save these for the gym.",
120231,3,03/22/2017,Still not quite right. I had to return these. My last good adrenaline pair was the 14. I've run in the adrenaline for years and never had injuries until recently. The 15 hurt my feet - felt  too small and had to be returned. I ordered the 16 in wide & 1/2 size bigger but in 3 months twisted / broke my fibula on wet leaves  ( felt better on R bunion but too loose ? for the L foot I hurt vs just bad luck ). The 17 bothered my big toe bunion just walking in the house. It seems to have a curved medial seem that bothers the bunion and possibly a  smaller toe box??. The 14 had a straighter seam and just fabric/no seam  where the bunion falls. The 17 still feels a little snug. Please go back to the shape/fit of the adrenaline 14 and prior.,
120231,1,03/21/2017,Don't know what size to order anymore!! I have wore these shoes for years and I love them but the 2016's were to narrow. I normally order a 8 wide. So I tried an 8 2E and those are to wide. I don't have a store near me that carries wide. So have to order them online. What happened? Please go back to the sizing you had in 2015's!! Why do you mess with the sizing?,
120231,5,03/20/2017,"My favorite shoe EVER!! Since discovering the Brooks Adrenaline several years ago, it is the only shoe I am interested in. I just completed my 10th half marathon in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and was more than happy with my new Brooks. I am now starting training for my second full marathon this fall and I'm confident my Brooks will carry me to the finish line. Thank you!!",
120231,5,03/19/2017,I have already ordered two more pairs! Took forever to find a perfect fit - I'm ordering another two pairs because I never want to be without them.  One pair for work to walk at lunchtime - one pair for the gym and one for outside at home.,
120231,5,03/19/2017,Shoes ,
120231,5,03/19/2017,"Love these Rock and Roll Sneakers! This is my 4th pair of Brooks.  I have loved every pair.  I bought these to work out at the gym and also for running.  They feel great and fit well.  An added bonus is the great limited edition Rock and Roll pattern on the shoes!  Love the guitars and the great colors!  As a female, these things caught my eye.  Very cute great shoes!",
120231,5,03/18/2017,"Great out of box shoe I have always switched up my shoe brands, but I find myself reaching for Brooks shoes more often.Always very comfotable.",
120231,5,03/18/2017,"LOVE THEM!!! I'm in nursing always on my feet!  Found Brooks shoes been wearing for 2 years now!  Great support!  My back, legs and feet do not ache so badly ne more!  Have recommended to other nursing staff who have bought and now love brooks too!!!  LOVE THESE SHOES!!!  Will never go to work in another pair of shoes!",
120231,5,03/15/2017,"Love these shoes Have been running in these for year, comfortable out of the box. I use an arch support for my high arches. Remain blister free since running in these.",
120231,2,03/15/2017,Not what I expected I purchased these because they were on the list for best shoes for plantar fasciitis.  They are definitely made for people with a high arch or a normal arch.  I have flat feel and one day of wearing them my feet were in pain.  I'm disappointed because they look really nice and had great reviews.,
120231,5,03/13/2017,I run without socks so comfort is a big deal & it's a win! I'm running the St. Jude's half marathon in April and my boss purchased them for me so I could do well since it's my first. I did break them in with a 5K and placed 22nd out of 231. So I'm a happy girl and so grateful for good shoes. My feet didn't even hurt.,
120231,5,03/12/2017,"Exactly what I was looking for. No break-in required. These are the perfect shoes that helped me reduce injury, running 10-25miles/week or more. Will never run in anything but Brooks!",
120231,5,03/11/2017,"Best shoes I've ever found! Bought 5 more! I no longer need orthotics. Best shoe I've owned. Took Brooks sizing and recommended shoe quizzes. They were spot on! Bought my first pair at a retail store. Liked them, bought a 1/2 size larger at Brooks. Liked it! Took the tests and bought the size they recommend. Love 'em! I do a lot of walking and these are great. Hitting the gym next week!",
120231,5,03/08/2017,My Go-To Sneaker I prefer a shoe with support and this delivers.  Super comfortable - my 3rd pair now and will keep buying them!,
120231,5,03/07/2017,Would buy Love this brand of shoes.  They are the only thing ive found that keeps my plantar fasitis from hurting.  Originally bought to help with my feet landing to the outsides of feet but they still do some which i wish didnt happen.  I am a cna and theses are all i wear to work and my feet dont hurt like everybody else,
120231,5,03/07/2017,Lots of cushion and support ,
120231,5,03/07/2017,"AWESOME!! No WONDER I can't find any more styles in my size! Just recovering from a bunionectomy & this shoe is WONDERFUL!! Light, comfortable, flexible & plenty of support!  JUST GREAT :) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get more of my size in stock!!!!! Thanks :)",
120231,4,03/06/2017,"These shoes are very comfortable. I used them for a 5k race, they were great.  No bisters at the end of the race.",
120231,2,03/04/2017,"Not sure about these yet. I have been using the product at the gym and outdoors for running and walking.  Just not sure about them.  I am blistering pretty bad.  I ordered the same size i always wear.  I'm not sure if the shoe is just a little small or what, but I haven't had this happen in Brooks' before.",
120231,5,03/04/2017,"Best workout shoes I've bought Order these a full size bigger than what you wear. The shoes are amazing, and the most comfortable running shoes I have bought. I workout 3 times a week and they stay really well.",
120231,5,03/03/2017,"They are comfortable and, would order this brand again ",
120231,5,03/03/2017,I will never buy anything but Brooks!!! These shoes provide great support and are comfortable for work when on your feet for 10+ hours!! Ever since I switched to brooks I have no foot pain!!,
120231,3,03/03/2017,Bought first in person ,
120231,3,03/03/2017,I love the look of these but they hurt my feet ,
120231,5,03/03/2017,Love these shoes! These shoes have made all the difference in my workouts and comfort. This is the 2nd pair of Adrenalines I have purchased.,
120231,5,03/02/2017,awesome!!  They are perfect!! ,
120231,1,03/01/2017,"external plastic stripes have no give, pinch at ball I've loved the GTS for years. But this year's model has plastic stripes on the outside including at the ball of the foot.  The plastic stripes have no give and it pinches really badly when stepping.",
120231,1,02/28/2017,Not happy So far not happy with this shoe the Brooks GTS 17 adrenaline too hot and heavy for running,
120231,1,02/25/2017,"Darn I was hoping they had fixed the 17's Loved and miss my Brooks? so I was hoping they had fixed the disaster that was the 16, but no such luck.  Will have to stick to Asiacs until we see what happens with the 18's 😔",
120231,1,02/23/2017,"Disappointed I've been wearing the Brooks Adrenaline for years, and I've bought them every year, never having a problem until the 17. They put a hard strip of plastic in a spot which is very uncomfortable for me (right across the toes). In the past the toe box has been so comfy, but not the 17s.  I had to return the shoe and am hoping that with the next version, they'll revisit the shoe's design. As others have said, going back to the design of the 14 would suit me just fine!",
120231,2,02/20/2017,"Blisters on my arches I really wanted to love these shoes. My last 2 pairs were Brooks Ravenna, but the store I was at didn't have my size in that model so I went with this one. After just 1 run I had a horrible blister from the awkward stitching/fabric alignment on the inseam. I thought maybe my socks bunched or something so I waited a few days and tried to run again, but after a mile, the same pain came back only to reveal another blister in the same spot. I'm bummed I have to return them but I'm glad Brooks stands by their products and has a great return policy.",
120231,3,02/20/2017,"Switching back to the launch Shoes are extremely supportive and good for high arches, but way too heavy in my opinion. I run quite frequently and immediately got shin splints after switching from the launch. It may be the way I run or the shape of my foot, but i wouldn't recommend for runners. I'd say these shoes are best for waking.",
120231,3,02/17/2017,Not like the old versions. .. I've been running marathons for 15 years. Been wearing the GTS for the last 10 yrs. They used to be great shoes. Whatever updates they did to this 17 causes blisters on my arch within 3 miles. Not good. Not good at all Brooks. I always trash the cheapo sock liners that come with the shoe and replace with Spenco insoles. Not even Body Glide is preventing these blisters. Very disappointed.,
120231,3,02/13/2017,"Good Support, Not Enough Cushion I like the support of this show, but there is virtually no cushioning.  I liked everything else about this shoe.  I've decided to give the Tanscend a try since the reviews indicate it has the support and cushioning I'm looking for.",
120231,3,02/11/2017,"Please, go back to whatever you were doing prior to the 15! Was a loyal adrenaline fan for years....up until the 15. The 15 and 16 were miserable, totally different fit and had to go up a half a size. Started buying another brand and wrote off the adrenaline. I heard the 17 was heading back toward the 14s and was thrilled. They are OK. Better than the 15/16. Toe box finally widened out a bit, I think but still not back to 14s greatness. Will return and go back to the other brand, hopeful that Brooks will LISTEN to the feedback and maybe turn things around in the 18. Three out of 4 runners I know who loved and wore the adrenalines can't stand the newer designs.",
120231,5,02/10/2017,"AWESOMEAWESOMEAWESOME I used to run in the GHOST model but recently switched to the Adrenaline GTS by way of the coolest looking running shoe ever-the Adrenaline GTS 16 limited edition NY Marathon city lights edition.  I cannot find these ANYWHERE now so I added the Rock and Roll edition with the guitars on them-(GTS 17) and i freakin LOVE THEM!  Thank you BROOKS for making quality awesome looking shoes!  By the way, can you send me  in the right direction for my limited edition NY marathon city lights size 9 in womens?!?! Pretty please?!?!",
120231,1,01/30/2017,"Still Not Back to What it Was It looks like Brooks finally addressed the sizing issues and I can wear the same size now that I wore before the 15.  That is the only good thing I can say.  The base of this shoe feels cheap and is nothing like the old Adrenaline we all loved.  With 14 and under versions, the second I put it on, I knew I had a very special shoe.  The foot bed / base of the shoe was luxurious - firm yet forgiving like no other shoe.  It was the element that made the Adrenaline different than any other shoe I have tried and the only shoe I wore after finding it.  As I said, there is nothing special about the base of the 17 and I can get the same cheap feel for a lot less money.  Unfortunately, as with the 15s and 16s I tried, the 17s I ordered will be heading back to Brooks and I remain on the hunt for a good shoe.  SUGGESTION FOR BROOKS - Stop playing around with the shoe and go back to what worked!  Pull out the specifications for any OLD Adrenaline (14 or lower) and just start building that shoe again!!  Those were the winners.  15 on up appear to simply be an attempt to cut costs and cheapen what was previously a fabulous shoe!  We, your customers notice!",
120231,1,01/30/2017,So Sad I have been running in Brooks Adrenaline GTS for 5 years now. My favorite version by far is the 14s (go back to them!). I was ok with each update even though I felt like each time they were getting tighter with less space in the toe box. They still worked though and I ran with no pain until this last update. I was so sad because for the first time ever I had to return a running shoe! The 17s are almost to supportive and even in a wide was giving me bad pain on the lateral side of my foot with each step. I was lucky enough to snag another pair of 16s before they went out of stock in my size. I am a loyal Brooks customer and would hate to have to switch brands next year :(. Brooks please go back to the 14 version!,
120231,5,01/25/2017,"Hesitant, but Pleased I've been a loyal Adrenaline wearer for over 13 years, often trying other Brooks and different brands, but always come back. After reading the negative reviews of the 17's, I decided to try the Ravenna and had mixed feelings about them. So I ordered the Adrenaline's, hesitantly, and as soon as I put them on my feet it felt like home. Don't know why I ever strayed.",
120231,5,01/22/2017,"Love the updates! I got these for my birthday and run in them three times per week (mostly sidewalks and well-maintained trails). They broke in pretty quickly - a bit stiff at first, but now they feel great. I loved my GTS 15s, and was hesitant to try the 17s, but they provide fantastic stability, are comfortable and versatile, and look great. I've even run in shallow snow, and was quite pleased with the traction! They aren't too wide, but there's room for my Superfeet Green in there as well.",
120231,5,01/18/2017,"Great Support and Comfort for Running I run /walk intervals. A bunion on my right foot began bothering me. My podiatrist wanted me to use orthotics, but these shoes solved the problem.  Have been using them for 3 months now.  I hadn't bought Brooks in years because in teh past they had seemed too tight, but the toe box on thee seems a bit larger.  And I love the tongue tied lace holder!",
120231,5,01/17/2017,"Very Impressive I am an advanced senior runner who occasionally suffers from sciatica. I went to a running center to get fitted, and after trying several shoes that I have worn in the past, this shoe was suggested after my gait was analyzed. I recommend doing this! After running in these Brooks, I feel much more energized. In addition my recovery is remarkably shorter! No problems with sciatica flareup. They are light with the right amount of cushioning. Love them!",
120231,5,01/12/2017,"truly my go to shoe I'm a regular runner, and have worn several iterations of the adrenaline. Before buying the 17, I decided I wanted to branch out try other shoes in case there was something better out there for me. I quickly discovered that nothing could beat the adrenaline-- and that's even after getting professionally fitted at a running store. The best part of the 17 is that it has a more cushioned impact and is less stiff than the 16. These shoes didn't even need to be broken in! I just strapped them on and ran! For those complaining that it's too small, this is why its important to go get fitted at a professional running store! I am flat footed and pronate. The adrenaline, as always, provides the perfect amount of support so that I can run happy :)",
120231,5,01/02/2017,"Saved my life Love this shoe. After weeks of searching for the right shoe, finally found it. i walk everyday 5 miles with my dog. saved my life. perfect for Low Arch!!!",
120231,4,12/29/2016,Better than last 2 versions but runs short I've been an Adrenaline GTS wearer since the 3. I haven't been pleased with the past couple of models but I like this one. It's a bit stiffer than before but comfort isn't lost. I suggests ordering a half size larger than you normally wear in this shoe. The 17 model seems shorter than the 25 or so other pairs of this shoe I have owned.,
120231,1,12/21/2016,"Disappointing Shoe - Very Uncomfortable I am a faithful Brooks Adrenaline wearer because of my narrow feet. I have not had any issues at all with the 16s and have bought several pairs - in fact just ran a marathon. I was excited about an updated shoe, but when I got them they immediately started rubbing horrible blisters on the inside of my feet. They were so uncomfortable I had to stop wearing them and search for new 16s. I will have to search for a new brand/shoe after these 16s wear out. Very disappointing.",
120231,2,12/11/2016,Too small Have been wearing women's GTS since 2005.  Buy 2 pairs yearly.  The 2017 feels too small. Wear a 9.5.  Store measured me and I'm still a 9.5    Measured it to my other models and it is smaller.  Will return this pair and wait until 2018 - which is a long ways away. Does anybody listen at Brooks?  Very disappointed.,
120231,1,12/05/2016,"not room in the toe, so narrow i have only been able to wear these shoes about 6 times....hoping they would stretch and be more comfortable. at first i used my orthotics, but the shoes felt too tight, so i went back to the inserts that came with the shoes.  the toe box is so tight that my toes cramp after 15 minutes of wearing them.  now i've worn them, can't return them so will giving them to goodwill!  a total loss!",
120231,5,11/25/2016,"My favorite Adrenaline version so far I buy the updated Adrenalines each year. This version has more cushion without adding any weight (in fact, they feel more streamlined). I bought these three days before the NYC marathon and ran in them without any need to break them in: no blisters, no rubbing, felt great. I highly recommend this version and I look forward to buying another pair. Thanks Brooks!",
120231,2,11/23/2016,"Too msall Womens GTS 17 - wear for casual, work out and work.  Don't run.  Sorry didn't see reviews before bought the size 9 - tho it fits it's too small.  Cannot return as wore and store won't take back.  Felt good at first try in store but after a few days feet ached.  Have been buying GTS for over 12 years.  Why can't you guys get it right this time and always feel the need to change the shoe.  Don't you read past reviews.  Going to look at another brand and hoping the GTS 18 model will be like the ""old"" days.  Don't you listen to customers??  Very disappointed.",
120231,3,11/20/2016,"Undecided I wear women's Adrenaline GTS all the time.  Have to wear sneakers due to Achilles problem.  PT put me into this shoe in 2004.  Have loved it tho the past few years not so much.  So I now have the GTS 17 for about a week.  Itt does feel smaller than the 16 model it's ok for me as I'm between a 9-9.5 shoe.  The best ever model was the 2014 and as I recall the 2008.  I do believe the 17 will work out okay once broken in, which I've never had to do before.  Because I work in a library I like conservative colors and do have the black; as well as older models that I guard because I love the colors.  This year I bought the dark navy because I love the color.  Brooks - why do you have to charge an additional $10 for this color?  Are the faithful being punished?  Will keep buying Brooks until you drive me away.",
120231,5,11/19/2016,Best Running Shoes! These are the best running shoes that I have ever owned. I ordered the recommended half size up than I normally wear in other athletic shoe brands and they fit great! The support is amazing when running indoor and outdoors in these shoes. I want to get them in another color soon!,
120231,4,11/08/2016,"NYC Special Edition Shoe I Love these! Have received many, many compliments, but order larger...these run small. I am a true size 8 and my big toes hit the front.",
120231,1,11/07/2016,"So Disappointed! Brooks Adrenaline were my go to running sneaker for many years.  I have owned over 10 pairs.  I changed to a different brand last year due to a hip injury and decided to try the GTS 17 again for more support.  I have attempted to run in them twice.  They are so stiff and have no cushion. My legs feel like lead while running, I now have shin splints and experienced quite a bit of pain in my hamstring.  They will be heading back to the store this week.  What happened to my Adrenaline's I once knew and loved?  For years a different running shoe was not even a thought.",
120231,3,11/05/2016,"Run narrower than previous Adrenaline GTS shoes I have worn Women's Brooks Adrenaline for several years at my job as a registered nurse. I just got a new pair of Adrenaline GTS 17 and they seem more narrow than previous pairs I had. There was never any ""break-in"" period with previous shoes, they were always comfortable from the very beginning, which is why I have remained loyal to the brand. The GTS 17 hurt my feet so badly that I had to go back to wearing my old pair. This is so disappointing to me, since I really relied on a good comfortable shoe for the miles I walk each day at work. This is a light-weight, durable shoe. I have machine washed previous pairs and they come out looking like new.",
120232,4,12/19/2017,Runs large I will likely return these for a smaller size or a different shoe. They seem to run very large and were heavily cushioned. The cushion felt comfy but I didn't feel connected to the ground. Felt like my foot was angled back (heel lower than toes). Awkward and bulky. Like a kid wearing an adult's shoe.,
120232,5,12/19/2017,"How much for a lifetime supply? I LOVE these shoes! I tried them on back in the summer when I was looking for my first pair of trail shoes and laughed out loud when I felt them spring under my feet like a trampoline. I loved the feel, but I was looking for something with a slimmer profile at the time, so I went with the Cascadia (which I also love). As night started to fall earlier and I was having to do most of my running on lighted sidewalks (ouch!), I knew my joints weren't going to make it through the winter without more bounce than what was left in my older pair of GTS Adrenaline (which I really like). I went back to my local running store, put the Calderas on again and laughed out loud - again. But I also tried an On shoe that day that was super-light and really intriguing, so I decided to give it a go. I bought the Ons and took them out for 6 miles on the concrete. I may as well have been on bare feet! I HATED them! Back to the store they went and I Cyber Monday-ed myself a pair of Calderas. Why, oh why, didn't I just buy these the first time?!?! I LOVE these shoes. They are not super-light, but the weight is very manageable and the spring in these puppies, even with Superfeet insoles, is amazing. The more I run, the more energy they give back. They've increased my cadence markedly because I don't feel like I can even keep my feet on the ground! So far, I haven't had them on the trail, just pavement and concrete. But I'm ready to sign up for a lifetime supply. Hands down favorite running shoes ever.",

120232,5,11/17/2017,Great Trail running shoe I love this shoe for running on the trails of the Metroparks here in Cleveland. The shoe is so comfortable I also ran the Columbus half marathon in it. My only complaint is that after some wear the material started ripping on both sides of the front.,
120232,4,10/19/2017,"Love them!! Feels great when I'm on the trail! I started trail running and love that Brooks lets you take their gear for a test run!! I mainly road run but I'm loving the trails in these shoes! My only complaint would be that the insole is loose and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be or it's just a fluke, But it doesn't effect my runs and I will buy them again! Thanks!!",
120232,5,09/05/2017,"Perfect for trail running! In love! I have a running shoe problem--road shoes, trail shoes (summer trail shoes, summer wet day shoes, winter running shoes), so I have tried a lot of brands & shoes!My go-to road shoe is the Brooks Ghost, but I had been a little disappointed in the Cascadias for trails. I decided to try these about 5 months ago & although it took my ankles a little time to adjust to the height of the cushioned sole (several ""almost ankle rolls""), I absolutely love them. I don't think about them while I'm running, which is how running shoes should feel.  They're cushioned enough for my 37 year old joints, but rugged enough to tackle the trails, they've held up well & they look great. I highly recommend!",
120232,5,08/20/2017,Everyone should buy these shoes. I bought these because I have plantar fasciitis and my doc recommended a zero drop midsole to help stretch the ligament.  While these are not a zero drop they are only 4mm and I definitely noticed a difference from my regular running shoes which are between 10 and sometimes 12mm.  These are very cushioned.  They feel tiny bit wide but my foot doesn't slide around.  I've also worn them to work where I stand on my feet all day and they are quite plush.  And lastly they are very water resistant.  Played in the yard with my dog after it rained in these and my feet stayed dry.,
120232,5,08/14/2017,"THE best trail shoe I originally got the Mazama, which I DO love...but I felt like on a longer run I needed a little more cushioning. I tried the Cascadia, but they felt a little too heavy. Ironically, I tweeted out some time ago that Brooks should make a trail version of my favorite road shoe, the Launch. I feel like they did just that! These are amazing, just enough cushion, not heavy, great flex, and great grip.",
120232,2,08/08/2017,"trail runners? I hiked the Appalachian Trail last year in Cascadias and was so excited when Brooks came out with an even lighter shoe. I normally trail run in Hokas and these had a similar feel so I hoped that they would combine the Cascadia's durability with Hoka's comfort.Instead, I am 700 miles into the Continental Divide Trail and almost through my second pair. 500-800 miles per shoe is generally the thru-hiker standard and these have fallen significantly short of the mark. I overpronate slightly and my first pair developed a hole in the heel so large that I had to hike in sandals until my new ones arrived. The second pair will have one soon, though the rest of the shoe is still in relatively good shape. The fabric on the side began to tear just several days in as well and I developed blowouts on both sides.These shoes would be great for softer dirt trails but anything more technical will destroy them. I really wanted them to work but they are so fragile - especially the heel - that I have to question their marketing as trail shoes and look elsewhere for the remainder of my hike.",
120232,5,08/07/2017,I would buy these shoes again ,
120232,5,07/27/2017,"Just what I wanted! I chose the Caldera because it was very similar in weight and heel drop to the Pure Cadence, my go-to road shoe.  I often buy shoes in men's because I like the wider toe box and better fit but opted for the women's model after reading reviews.  I'm so glad I did.  While some women may find it roomy, it was just perfect for me!  The only change I would suggest is to switch out the laces with the stretchy ones that come on the Pure line of road shoes.",
120232,5,07/25/2017,"Back home with BROOKS! Yay! I was a loyal Brooks fan for years, then like most shoes/brands, they changed my shoe. I am also one of those people who think about the company I am buying from not just the shoe itself. Sadly, I had to drive around some other brands but I've missed Brooks and am SO incredibly happy the Calderas are here and have brought me home! LOVE the wide(r) toe box, comfortable fit and hide-away-laces. Please don't change anything about this shoe (especially not the toe box - maybe make the lugs a bit bigger - that's my only suggestion). Thanks Brooks!",
120232,5,07/08/2017,"Hiked Mt. Evans (14,264 ft.) in these shoes! I've been hiking 14'ers for a few years now in hiking boots, but thought I would try Caldera Trail shoes one time.  Now I'm hooked!  After 5 hours of hiking/climbing, my feet still feel great.  They provided me with the support and cushion I needed to have a successful hike and Happy Feet.",
120232,5,07/02/2017,Absolutely will buy these Calderas in every new color! Lightweight and so comfortable. First time wear we went for a 20 mile hike and no issues what so ever.  Plus very fun colors.,
120232,5,06/30/2017,Excellent support and comfort These are a value worth every penny my feet are so happy.  The shoes have plenty of toe box space and the footbed is super support and comfy.  I am a fan of Cascadia as well this shoe is similar but more cushion and spring as well as toe box room.   My foot pain is usually between my second and third toe as I step with this shoe there is zero pain.  Great support can't say enough so I will say thank you Brooks you have solved many issues for me.,
120232,5,06/26/2017,Hard to find Never thought I would find a sport shoe that I would wear for miles and not hurt my feet.  Had to try many before I found this one. Have a painful arch and everything hurts.  This shoe feels like it rolls with my arch when I walk on any surface or exercise equipment.  Bought these to walk the Camino in Portugal.  Walking 5-10 miles at a time and could not do it without this shoe.  Thank you brooks!,
120232,5,06/20/2017,"Comfy, supportive & light! I bought these specifically for running on the rocky terrain of my driveway & the county roads near my home. I've only had one run in them, but they are light weight, feel great and provided the support & traction I was hoping for.",
120232,2,06/13/2017,Walking on a rocker Running but it was silly and dangerous. So I walked my dog a few times. Returning them for a different kind,
120232,5,06/10/2017,I love this new Brooks trail shoe!!! I run 4-7 miles daily and love the support and stability these shoes offer! My favorites and my Ghosts are a second place:-),
120232,5,05/17/2017,These will turn me into a trail runner! These are the kind of shoes that when you take them out of the box and put them on you just have to go for a run immediately.  They feel incredible.  The cushion is lovely and there is a bit of bounce that rebounds you off the ground.,
120232,5,05/09/2017,"Best Trail Shoe Ever! My first run in my Caldera were actually on the road, not the trail.  I took these bad boys for 20 miles on their maiden voyage.  They did not disappoint!  I have done about 200 miles combination trail and road, and they're my absolute favorite.  I will be buying more pairs/colors to keep my feet happy!",
120232,5,05/04/2017,"Love, Love, Love This Shoe!!!!!! I can't say enough good things about these shoes!!!!  I have heel spurs and plantar fasciitis.  I have ordered shoe after shoe trying to find something that would work for my feet.  Finally, I found these!!  I just ordered my fifth pair once I saw there was a new color.  Please keep new colors coming.  I do not want to be without these shoes!!",
120232,5,04/25/2017,Wonderful shoe Best shoe my arches have ever felt. Lots of support and the energy in the shoe is great. Recommend 100% for people with high arches. Colors are a bonus too :),
120232,5,04/17/2017,Wonderful Cushioned Trail Shoe I have run a 25k trail race as well as a Marathon trail race in these shoes. They are wonderful! The only downside is that the forefoot width is a tiny bit narrow. They are light and durable. They also have just the perfect cushioning for being out there on your feet for 4+ hours.,
120232,5,04/07/2017,"First pair of Brooks and I'm hooked Began my running venture 3 weeks ago and quickly realized I needed a shoe that was meant for running on the current snowy, muddy, Maine terrain. My running partner recommended Brooks and after considering Cascadia and PureGrit, I ultimately went with the Caldera. Hugely in part of a previous review mentioning a wide toe box. Logged 6 miles so far and my brand new runner feet are happy.",
120232,5,04/06/2017,"Boy was I wrong ... I have been a fan of all Brooks running shoes for quite some time and have run in all of the trail shoes except this one. I was putting it off because they looked big and clunky (to be honest) ... BOY WAS I WRONG! These are a dream trail shoe! I run ultras in both the Cascades and the Pure Grits, but these won me over!! The are light weight, cushiony but not clunky or oversized, and responsive to the trails. YOU nailed this one Brooks!! Now for some added colors!! Please!",
120232,5,03/27/2017,"Brooks has a winner with this one! I've been running earnestly for four years or so, but have slowly gravitated from road races to trail races in the past couple of years. Although I ran in Brooks Cascadia, it was just one of a number of different trail shoes I tried and ran in, as I continued my search for the perfect trail shoe. Well, I think I'm done searching, because Brooks has hit a home run with the Caldera. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the wide toe box -- thank you!! It lets you grip and adjust as you run the trails. It's lightweight but firm, easily drains (I can run through mud and river crossings!) and like the slight heel drop (I tried another brand with a zero drop that was too much and caused foot issues). Please don't change a thing -- just keep coming out with new colors. I will be a happy camper with a closetful of Calderas in different colors. Thank you so much!",
120232,5,03/20/2017,"Brooks Got This One Right I've been a wearer of the Cascadias since the 7s. I went to the running store with all intentions of purchasing the Cascadia 12s; however they were not in stock.  The associate recommended these because a lot of people have complained about the Cascadias becoming too narrow over the years, and these have a wider toe box.  I tried them on; they are super lightweight compared to the Cascadias! So I bought them...Ran 8 miles on trails right from the box and was pleased with how good they felt. I am normally a size 7 in Brooks, and these were true to fit for me.",
120232,3,03/20/2017,"I sooo wanted these to work...... I wish i could give them a 3.5  stars. I have a large foot with almost no arch. I can wear Addictions and Beast w/o inserts (as a matter if fact i end up over corrected using inserts) . I tried these in the house for a short period, my left ankle started hurting and it's taken me days to calm it back down. Im so sad they didn't work for me, i never get to have pretty :-\",
120232,4,03/03/2017,"Caldera I usually wear size 8 Brooks shoes, but the Caldera run bigger.  I have to reorder half a size smaller.  It will be delivery today.  Will see how it feels.",
120232,5,03/03/2017,"Fantastic! I plan on using these for daily use, I do a lot of walking and needed more support than I was getting from other shoes. I also spend a lot of time on trails with our dogs and needed something to make the terrain comfortable to traverse.",
120232,5,01/31/2017,"Best trail shoes ever ! so happy Brooks finally has a trail shoe with stability and cushioning , so light , responsive , and comfortable , took them out for 8 miles of rough trail terrain and these shoes are simply amazing , can wait to buy another pair on a different color, Brooks has done an amazing job with  the Caldera .",
120232,5,12/15/2016,"This is turning out to be my favoritest Brooks shoe!! There's a new trail shoe in the Brooks lineup called the Caldera. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shoe!! It's cushy and supportive and best of all, it has a little built in velcro tab for gaitors! While I have always loved this brand, with this new shoe, I'm ecstatic!! Thanks for always being the show company with the most-est!!",
120233,5,12/28/2017,Great from the get go! Have never tried these before as I have bought/worn the Glycerine for years. I mostly walk off road and wanted a more trail oriented shoe and these fit the bill.These have been nothing but COMFORT from the first step!,
120233,4,12/27/2017,New to the trails and the shoes are great I haven't been trail running long and needed some cushioning. The shoes are good for the rocks and provide ample support.,
120233,1,12/17/2017,"Wish I'd bought another pair of Cascadia 11 instead Positives first: 1.)fits true to size2.) wider you're box than the 11s, which had me excited 3.) stylishNegatives:1.)  0% traction (slipped and slide all over the trail).... have not worn again for fear of injury ,2.) customer service didn't seem to care about my dissatisfaction with this shoe after 3 years of loyalty and continued persist after my bilateral foot surgeries. ...... Moving on to Ultras. They care about their customers and their trail experience and safety.",
120233,1,12/16/2017,Awful. Somehow made it harder to run. Feels like I have to press my feet through mud or like one of those dreams where you're running really hard and not getting anywhere. Also weirdly make me feel too high off the ground.,
120233,1,12/15/2017,"What the heck w the colors, brooks??? I love this shoe but what is going on with the colors??? Why can't we have normal, solid colors or at least the option for that? Every time I come back to try to purchase a new pair, there's more patches of neon colors added all over the shoe in new places.",
120233,5,12/01/2017,I would buy again. I love the support and style of the shoes. Very well made. I am having problems with the bottom of my feet hurting. I just replaced the inserts with some I ordered. Hopefully this will take care of the feet pain I have after walking. I don't blame this on the shoe because it was a already existing problem,
120233,5,11/13/2017,"Fourth pair of Cascadias- never going back Great durability, comfortable and perfect for long trail runs. Gives me the stability I need!",
120233,3,11/08/2017,"Not as good as older model of same shoe The treads on the bottom of the shoes are great and meet expectations. The material of the uppers is much cheaper than the #8 version of the same shoe I had years ago. They aren't extremely comfortable, feeling a little hard in the uppers.",
120233,5,11/05/2017,"Best Trail Shoe: Great Fit, Good Quality w/ High Mileage Way better fit than the Cascade 9s, 10s, or 11s. I hope they don't lose whatever they did RIGHT here w/ the 12s when they make the 13s! Pretty heavy-weight shoe, but that's what you get w/ a thick/protective sole. This shoe lasts a long time even with many miles. Cascadia is the best trail shoe ever made: yes, colors/fashion are always weird, but who cares they just get wrecked running anyway. PLEASE make an 'all black' one so that we can wear it for regular life, and not look like our feet are stuck in the 80s. I have bought many, many generations of Cascadia for trail/distance running, and I use it for good support running errands or at airport, as recommended by my coach.... I wish Brooks would make a punch card already for us loyal, repeat customers that are not ""sponsored"" -- these are expensive shoes.",
120233,4,11/01/2017,"Love the shoe, but wish there were better/more colors I've bought 2 pairs of these - both fit exactly the same. The fit is a little different from the previous version (Cascadia 11) but for me that is good. In terms of fit, they are similar to the 10s. They also brought back the longer laces (the laces were so short with the 11s). Overall, my go-to for running and day hikes. I only wish there were more color choices. #ReviewSweeps",
120233,5,10/27/2017,Yes! I had to send them back and go down a 1/2 size from my other Brooks running shoes.  Also loved that the heal was a little deeper since I wear orthotics and tend to have more heal slip in shoes because of the thickness of them.  Traction on my first run was amazing!,
120233,5,10/20/2017,Great shoe! Bought these for my wife for lightweight backpacking and hiking. She loves them a lot more than her Merrells. I have the men's version and they are very lightweight and breathable. Perfect for long distance backpacking.,
120233,5,10/15/2017,Love This Shoe This is my 4th pair of Cascadia and the 12 has to be my favorite due to comfort.,
120233,4,10/06/2017,"Wide foot female runner review I'm still breaking it in. The sole cushion is great. The toe area seems narrow. The outside cloth looks a little cheap. For the money, it could be better. Overall great shoe",
120233,5,09/10/2017,"Love these shoes! I used these as a back up trail shoe while hiking the Laugavegur in Iceland at the end of August 2017. I was worried about my normal hiking boots because I had broken a toe approx. 6 weeks prior to the hike and wanted to make sure I had some comfortable, yet very durable shoes to fall back on. These far exceeded my expectations! Not only are they comfortable and up to the task, they are very light weight and didn't weigh down my already full pack. I used these over the course of 55km in varied terrain and they held up great. I purchased the pickled beet/black/firedcoral color and really like it. The color selection could definitely be improved on the other versions of this shoe though! Also, I have very narrow feet with high arches, so I added a set of the green Super Feet to make these a little more snug. Probably not a problem for those with normal width/arches. Would definitely purchase again!",
120233,5,09/07/2017,"These shoes make all the difference I wear these to run maybe ten miles a week. Took a few miles to kinda break them in and get comfortable for me, but now I find them to be very comfortable and supportive and it gives me the confidence to lace up and run more often.",
120233,5,09/05/2017,"Once again, Brooks delivers an incredible shoe! I mostly use my Brooks shoes for hiking and gentle trail running. I took a chance on ordering a model I haven't tried before, based on the ""Find the Perfect Shoe For You"" (sic) by Brooks online. I am delighted. As always with Brooks, there is absolutely NO break-in period; all the shoes feel comfortable immediately. I really like the lateral stability of the Ravena for varied hiking trails, while still maintaining the grip & flexibility of a running shoe. I even wore them on a 6 hour horseback ride! My feet were the only thing that didn't hurt! It's the perfect shoe for me.",
120233,5,08/27/2017,First pair of trail running shoes I just started trail running and I was afraid it wasn't worth $130 to buy trail specific shoes but they make a huge difference. No pain in my arches or blisters! I can run over 6 miles on rough terrain and my feet feel great thanks to all the cushioning in these shoes! The traction is great too over rocks and tree roots.,
120233,1,08/21/2017,I've already returned this shoe.  Bought Adrenaline ASR 14 ,
120233,4,07/22/2017,"Great Shoe, Narrow/Small Toe Box Rugged shoe. Handles technical trails, water crossing, and anything you throw at it. Holds up after hard use. My one complaint is the toe box is close around the top of the toes and too narrow of a toe box. Some of the previous versions felt a little more roomy in the toe box! Would love to see a little space added to the next shoe!",
120233,5,07/04/2017,Love Them!! ,
120233,5,07/02/2017,"Great shoe, extra cushion and support but light weight! Great trail and road shoe! I ordered a size larger and it fits nice. Will definitely buy this again next time.",
120233,5,06/12/2017,"Super comfortable shoe! Have had cascades trail shoe in the past, love them.  I don't wear any other brand of shoe....Brooks all the way!",
120233,5,06/11/2017,"Best Brooks EVER!!!! Great on the trail!!! Cushioned, feels like you are floating over rocks & roots. I have been a Brooks user for years & these are my favorite shoes!!! Arch could be a little higher but it is awesome that you do not have to buy additional inserts for these shoes!!!! Great value!!!!",
120233,5,05/08/2017,"Great as I expected! Always hike with hiking boots all my life.  This trail runner changed entire my thought of the footwear.  Really comfortable so after the hike I don't need to take it off as I do with hiking boots.  I hang around in the camp site during my happy hour and cooking time till hit the bed. I bought my husband the same shoes, he loves it too.p.s. I slipped into a stream, it dried out quickly while I am walking.",
120233,5,04/17/2017,"Bought this for a long hiking trip So far, I'm still training for a 60 mile hike, but have used this on the road, on trails, and on a treadmill (with and without weight vest).  The shoe is very comfortable, not too heavy, and has a great grip even on wet/muddy surfaces.",
120233,5,04/02/2017,Love the show hate the colors I use this shoe during my hikes and trail runs in the Rocky Mountains. It is extremely comfortable and supports my feet nicely with cushion am structure. I just wish it came in better looking. Color combinations! I got the red and pink but it looked way better in the photo online.,
120233,5,03/31/2017,"Still the best shoe in the world Great shoe, so glad the foot box is wider again. I know some people complained about it, but for those of us with flat froggy feet, this shoe is an absolute dream. I am an avid runner who teaches PE--love having a shoe that can last on the court, on the field, on the trail, and in the mountains. Bonus: my students inform me the colors are ""icy"" and that this is a good thing. The only con is that I've noticed they wear very quickly--I already have a couple rips on the top where my bike rubbed it a little wrong, but I've only had them two weeks.",
120233,5,03/05/2017,"Love them and want them in other colors! I wear these to work out, run on the treadmill, run on trails, and just walking around.  These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  I've never owned a pair of Brooks before but I'm a convert.",
120233,5,03/04/2017,I love these. Definitely would buy these again and again. Great product needed something that I could workout in. I had no traction my other shoes and these are great for it. Love them for sure.,
120233,5,03/03/2017,one of my favorite trail shoes Haven't put tons of miles into these yet but they went on a VERY muddy 4mi run. Cascadias are easy to break into but in very muddy conditions they slip in uphill. Not the best getting rid of sticky mud. Excellent cusioning. I wish they had more traction downhill. Soft around the ankle which is important in technical trail running.,
120233,4,03/03/2017,"i would buy these again i haven't actually run in thee yet, I am waiting till the weather warms up a bit!",
120233,5,02/26/2017,"Great for many terrains! I used Cascadia 10 two years in a row for my many on and off road running adventures.  They were amazing due to support and traction.  I need good traction as I run on ice, in snow storms, rain, slippery woodland trails, etc.  I skipped the Cascadia 11s due to reviews about too narrow of width.  I decided to try the Cascadia 12s.  They feel much like the Cascadia 10s.  These shoes have already proven great in slippery situations as I ran roughly 5 miles on ice covered trails with snow drifts and wet spots.  They had the right traction to support me in all terrain I encountered.  They also repel water very well.  Many of my trails are sopping and these shoes do well to keep my feet from getting soaked.  My past Cascadias have been durable, and I hope these new Cascadias are as well.  They seem to start showing wear and tear at the time your company has said they would - between 300 and 500 miles.  My runs have given these shoes some rough terrain, and they have held together very well.",
120233,2,02/11/2017,"Wayyyy different fit Compared to the Cascadia 11, this update is wayyyy wider. There's extra room in an unusual spot - around the inside middle/arch part of the foot. It almost looks like a shoe that's rectangular. The extra room around the inside arch spills out over the sole and just has a funky shape. I understand an up-and-coming thru-hike market to make the shoe a tad wider, but it's roomy in all the wrong places. (SEE ATTACHED PICTURE) One thing I loved about the Cascadia 11s was the narrower fit. The heel cup also became wider. The outside material and construction seems clearly cheaper than the older version. Very plastic-y to me.",
120234,5,12/27/2017,I have bought these multiple times ,
120234,5,12/27/2017,Love these shoes! Bought 2 more pairs! These shoes are great! I work long hours in them and in the last 5 years these are the only shoes wear my feet don't hurt. I exercise in them too!,
120234,5,12/27/2017,Teen rec shoes ,
120234,4,12/26/2017,A comfortable shoe These shoes are comfortable for long walks. They breathe well and have ample height in the toe box. I would like them to be a bit more round in the toe rather than slightly pointed. The first pair of Brooks shoes I bought were the Pure Flow 1. They were so near perfect that I have sworn by Brooks ever since.,
120234,5,12/26/2017,I will definitely be buying Brooks in the future ,
120234,1,12/26/2017,Not buy again ,
120234,5,12/26/2017,2nd time buying this product ,
120234,2,12/25/2017,Heel is set higher. It pushes foot forward causing uncomfort It's heelis to much higher than toe pushing foot forward which hurts. Toe is rounded to a point that turns inward. Very uncomfortable.,
120234,5,12/24/2017,I will only buy Brooks This is my second pair of Brooks and I love them. They always feel like an extension of my own feet. The toe box is usually a little tight and I experienced some numbness in my toes the first day but I loosened the laces and now they're perfect! I've had a broken sesamoid in my left foot since 2014 and Brooks are the only shoes that relieve the discomfort from running. I convinced my sister to buy a pair and now she's addicted to Brooks too.,
120234,5,12/24/2017,Love how light these are. ,
120234,5,12/21/2017,Fourth Pair! I love the Launch! I just ordered my fourth pair and have been very happy with this shoe. I've worn the Launch for two marathons and for most of the running during training cycles for those races. The shoe is very comfortable for long runs and my every day runs. Each pair has lasted between 400-550 miles (I don't keep close track of my mileage for each shoe I wear) - very satisfied with this product.,
120234,5,12/21/2017,Love my new shoes!!! I wear these to work; I stand all day on a cement floor. These shoes are so light weight and comfy!!!,
120234,5,12/20/2017,"Absolutely LOVE these shoes! This is my 2nd pair of Brooks. They felt ""lighter"" than my first pair when I originally put them on. I wasn't sure I liked it since I felt a difference and I love my original pair. This pair is awesome! I do sprint drills at my gym and I think I'm running faster. I even screamed out, ""I love my new shoes!"" in the middle of a run. Also, wore them on my final 5K for 2017 last weekend and came in first in my age group. First time ever. They may be ""magical!"" Lol.I'm getting another color...I normally wear a half size up in running shoes. It is true with these shoes also. Love them!",
120234,4,12/20/2017,"Yes this is my 2nd pair, I would buy again ",
120234,5,12/19/2017,Great fit Loved the colors. The fit was excellent. I also have custom inserts that comfortably fit into these sneakers. They feel great!,
120234,5,12/19/2017,Absolutely love! I love these Brooks!!! They feel so comfortable as I run and I also wear them to class and the library because they are so comfy! They give me great support as I run and they are also pretty cute and stylish! 10/10 brooks over nike/additas!,
120234,5,12/19/2017,"Perfect fit out of the box! Wore this shoes right out of the box on a 9 mile run. I've increased miles since then and the shoes have only gotten more comfortable on my feet. I think the fabric portion may have stretched a bit since using them, but this is a good thing since they run about a half size small. I have a high arch, so I was just able to tie the shoes when I first got them, now after running with them a few weeks they're the perfect fit. I'm so glad I made the purchase and am considering a second pair!",
120234,4,12/18/2017,Good low mileage shors ,
120234,5,12/18/2017,Would buy again I run cross country and even though I wear them all the time they are still in great condition,
120234,5,12/18/2017,"Best Running Shoes Ever! I can't say enough about this brand, the only pair of show i can pull straight out of the box and run 10 miles with no issues!",
120234,1,12/18/2017,"manufacture defect or bad shoe? I've been wearing Brooks for 3 years now and these are the most disappointing pair I've had. The padding in the left foot was fine, but I could feel every tread on the bottom of the shoe in my right foot. I'm not sure if there was a defect but these are going back. I'm really grateful for Brooks 90 day guarantee- I'll be heading back to the ravenna model",
120234,5,12/18/2017,Love Ran in the Launch 3s for about eight months before finally replacing them with the Launch 4s.  Love the new version -- just as good as the 3s.  Would definitely recommend.,
120234,5,12/18/2017,Love these shoes This is at least my fourth pair of Launch. I love the cushioning at light feel.,
120234,5,12/18/2017,my favorite shoes ever! Such a great fitting shoe. Molds to your foot and so reactive to the ground. This is my second pair of Launch and I can't imagine wearing anything else!,
120234,5,12/17/2017,Absolutely I love these shoes.  They were comfortable the first time I wore them.  They were a little tight around the toe area but I have a wide foot so they will stretch out.,
120234,5,12/17/2017,"Great running shoe These are my favorite running shoes. They are lightweight and responsive but also have enough stability to PR a marathon. I wear them for most training runs and from 5k to marathons. For long training runs, I usually stick with Ghost.I love that there is no material on the upper to rub and cause blisters or soreness.Keeps getting better",
120234,3,12/16/2017,"Jury's still out. I bought these hoping that I would love switching off with my Ghost.The padding isn't nearly as good and the toe box is much more narrow so I have a callous from rubbing.Still willing to try them.Theyre super cute,very stable while running and have great support so we'll see?",
120234,5,12/16/2017,Brooks shoes ,
120234,5,12/16/2017,Comfortable and fast ,
120234,5,12/15/2017,"Definitely Recommend 👍 I normally wear Glycerin but bought a pair of launch 4 in the spring and love them, great color, super comfy !",
120234,5,12/15/2017,Great shoes! Love these shoes. Very comfortable and light. Felt broken in from day one. No blisters or complaints.,
120234,5,12/12/2017,yes i would buy brooks again ,
120234,5,12/12/2017,"I would by every color I would buy every color so that I could wear them every day!  Great running shoe and great overall shoe for all day wear.  Excellent and light weight on runs 10 miles or less - I need something a little cushioned for anything longer than that, but that is due to being tall :)",
120234,4,12/12/2017,I have 4 pairs of the same shoe ,
120234,5,12/11/2017,Pegasus out these shoes in! I have worn Nike  Pegasus for many years. It became very difficult to run in then after they created Pegasus 31 and newer models. For a few years now i have searched for a new running shoe that was comfortable right out of the box. I came across these and was skeptical at first since I have tried many different running shoes  but since I had nothing to loose i tried these and I amazed at how comfortable they were. Nothing hurt running in them. The support they provide is just right and you can put serious miles on them. So I bought 4 pairs of these just in case brooks decides to change this shoe ( hopefully not ),
120234,1,12/11/2017,No The comfort level was not what i expected for the money. I sold them to a friend and went for asics.,
120234,4,12/11/2017,"Satisfied customer They're actually very comfortable once you break them in, which didn't take me long at all. I was hoping they would help with my knee pain but alas, I had to quit running. They do seem a bit tight and I've read they run a half size small.",
120234,5,12/10/2017,I love the Launch 4! I run in these shoes. I bought them trying to replicate my faithful Launch 2 shoe. They come close.,
120234,3,12/10/2017,"Ok for the price Two issues with these shoes: (1) laces are way too short; (2) the top of the heel is placed too low for my anatomy and rubs my Achilles area. With thick enough socks, it's bearable. On the positive side, the shoes are very light and I enjoy the colors. I plan to keep them and get some longer laces so that I can get the fit adjusted just right.",
120234,5,12/10/2017,Light on my feet I love how light these feel. I have high arches and they provide strong support. I suffered a bad sprained ankle a few months ago and just got back to running....minimal pain from the ankle and my brace fits well inside the shoe. I was searching for a lighter shoe because my current ones seemed too bulky and were loud in the pavement. These are so much better! I'm sold!,
120234,5,12/10/2017,Definitely recommend!! ,
120234,5,12/09/2017,"All day, every day! Im on my feet all day and I wear these shoes all day every day with no pain. Thank you.",
120234,5,12/06/2017,Love this shoe!  I've bought 2 pair now. I use this show mainly in Piloxing as I can't go bare-foot.  It provides lots of stability and most of all there is no heavy structure across the front toes of the shoe.  I have bunion on my left foot and it's difficult to get shoes that don't have something that rub that spot.  This shoe is perfect!,
120234,4,12/06/2017,"I'm not in love, but I think I'm in like Looks-  The lightweight mesh and accents give this shoe a fun, stylish look that stays clean-looking.  Colors are vibrant.Feel- While the shoe feels slightly narrow through the forefront and toe box, the mesh material is pretty forgiving and keeps my toes from being to whiney.  The ride feels pretty firm, which I think makes sense, given the ""energetic"" nature.  This all seems like it should be right, but I'm still getting a little dead-foot sensation.Gription/Sole- responsive, grippy, sureness.  It's got a lot of feedback on footfall and that's generally a good thin.Bottom Line-- yes, I would recommend it to a friend, but only my friends with low overall foot volume, not my hobbit-footed friends.",
120234,3,12/05/2017,Wanted to love but too narrow ,
120234,2,12/04/2017,"Sending them back I am going to send these back.  I bought them, not to run in but as my new work shoes.  I am a group fitness instructor and personal trainer so a good shoe for all day is important to me.  I run in the Gylcerin and love them!  Thought I would try something a little cheaper for my day to day.  I am not pleased with this shoe, however.  I ordered a 1/2 size up based on other people's reviews and that did seem appropriate.  But the shoe was not comfy for all day wear.  In addition, it lead to some heel discomfort/pain (I am slightly prone to this without a good shoe).",
120234,1,12/03/2017,"Disappointed I am a huge fan of brooks, I've worn the ravena and ghost in the past and saw these on sale and decided to try them out. The toe box is extremely small, and I have narrow feet; my toes were numb within an hour of wearing these. When working out my toes stayed numb, even with loosening the laces.  They also didn't have the support that I'm used to getting with my brooks in the past, my ankles did not feel stable wearing them when compared to my previous shoes. I think the other models are much more worth the cost.",
120234,5,12/02/2017,Great! No break in time. Would buy again. I ordered new shoes for a race coming up. They arrived a week before and I ran in them at least twice before running a 9mile race. I like these shoes and would buy again when needed,
120234,4,12/02/2017,"These are ok. I normally wear the Ghost 9. I have been wearing the Launch for about 3 weeks. Nothing rubs or hurts, so I can't say I dislike the shoe. The Ghost felt more cushioned under my heel, which I like. It is holding up well. I run on streets, about 30 miles per week.",
120234,5,11/30/2017,"This is my third pair of Brooks! Love them! These run a little more narrow then the other ones I purchased, but they still feel great. I use them for the gym. More cross training then just running.",
120234,5,11/30/2017,Yes i Only wear these shoes for running and the are very comfortable.  They fit like a slipper and are light.  They have improved my time a little.,
120234,5,11/30/2017,"Cool and stylish! This was my first try of the Launch 4. I get lots of compliments on them every time I wear them. Makes me look like a ""cool grandma"".",
120234,3,11/29/2017,"Slightly disappointed My last 4 pair of Brooks have been size 9. My toe is almost to the top, & the width is tight. My feet actually ached after trying these at work today...not even during a run. I just want my old, worn out, Pureflow 4 back.",
120234,5,11/28/2017,"Great shoe for bootcamp I wanted a shoe with support and shock absorption for my general training, bootcamp classes. Most of the cross trainer shoes need more time to be developed correctly, and do not offer enough support at this time. This shoe is a great alternative for those us who do not run but need a good shoe to exercise in!",
120234,1,11/28/2017,"Bring back the Launch 3s I have 4 pairs of the Launch 3s. I hate the Launch 4s. The toe box feels narrower, the forefoot feels less cushioned and the heel rubs. I ran 3 times in these shoes and decided I had to give up because my feet were killing me after about 2 miles each time.",
120234,5,11/28/2017,AmazeBalls! Like walking on a cloud. Only complaint is I usually wear an 8 but had to order an 8.5.,
120234,4,11/28/2017,"Overall good shoe. Happy with them. Light shoe. They fit a little smaller than I anticipated. I switched to these from the Adrenaline GTS, and I've always worn the same size in Brooks. Wishing I'd gotten a half size bigger in the Launch 4, though.",
120234,5,11/26/2017,Great! I've wanted to try Brooks for a long time. My first pair didn't disappoint!  I will be buying more!,
120234,3,11/26/2017,"Indoor workouts, they're great! Outdoor running not so much. I use them often for running indoors, & weight training. I ran a race & I got shin splints & I stretched. I'm disappointed - my guess is that they're not flexible & light enough.",
120234,3,11/25/2017,Maybe Shoe are comfortable but they rubbed against my heels and caused them to blister. I will most likely be returning them.,
120234,5,11/23/2017,I would definitely buy this product again. ,
120234,4,11/23/2017,"Great Look Taking a little longer than usual for my arches to feel comfortable.  I always wear the Launch, so I hope the new version still works for me.",
120234,3,11/22/2017,Tight and narrow ,
120234,4,11/22/2017,"Great shoes for shorter distances The shoes feel great until about 3/4 of a 5k. I'm not sure if it's just me needing more padding then others, but, right around that distance the ball of my foot starts feeling like I am walking on hard concrete. So for that reason, I would not recommend for long distance but other than that they look and feel amazing.",
120234,5,11/22/2017,I love these shoes I switched to the Launch after several years in the Ravenna.  I found that I needed a much more neutral shoe.  The Launch is perfect.  It fits well and is light and springy.  My feet feel great after running and I like how many color options are available.  I these will be my new Go-To Shoe.  I am currently training for a full marathon and wore these out of the box on a 20 mile run; no problems whatsoever.,
120234,4,11/22/2017,"Good shoe I love this shoe because it fits me great and it feels like I'm walking on clouds. It's thin soled which is nice too because I don't like thick soles. My only complaint is that it feels like theirs not enough padding in the heels - I bought a spongy heel cup that fixed the problem(Ive had to do that with all of my Brooks, not sure if it's just me or the shoes). Otherwise i love them. I use them for work; I work in a hospital",
120234,5,11/21/2017,"Awesome shoe! This shoe handles so well during speed workouts and easy runs.  It is lightweight, but offers tremendous support and stability as you foot strikes the ground.  Once I ramp up my training, I can see these shoes performing really well in long distance races.",
120234,5,11/20/2017,Sizing runs small. Needed a full size bigger but I love them Not a runner but my feet needed a good supportive shoe for just 'kicking around' and these fit the bill perfectly.  Look great too!,
120234,5,11/20/2017,Recommend First experience buying runnig shoes on-line.  Brooks has it down to a science and SUPER EASY!!,
120234,5,11/18/2017,This is my 2nd pair! ,
120234,3,11/18/2017,"Buy a half size up! I wanted to love these.  They were so springy and light, but they KILLED my heels.  I ran a short 3 miler in them and both heels were tender.  I tried them again and 5 and ended up with a beast of a blister.  I've worn Brooks for years and always a 9.5 but in this shoe, I should have gone 10.  I think i am going back to the ghosts.",
120234,5,11/18/2017,I would buy this shoe over and over again!! ,
120234,5,11/17/2017,"Great ! But a little small Very light & stylish. It looks bulky I promise it's not. I normally wear a 7, so I got a 7 and it was very fitted. Maybe go up half a size",
120234,5,11/17/2017,This is my favorite shoe I have run in every version of the launch and love this shoe. It fits my foot perfectly with no hot spots. I think they are versatile - I run faster in them but also feel comfortable doing long runs in them. One might want more of a shoe for longer distances but these can work depending on what you want.Thanks Brooks for continuing to make this shoe.,
120234,5,11/16/2017,I really like the Launch 4! I love the comfort of the Launch 4 - After trying my first pair I had to order a second ! I like the color selections and that a basic black and white was offered. I have been loyal to wearing Brooks since I started running 5 years ago and will continue.,
120234,4,11/15/2017,"breathable shoe Very comfy shoe, love the breezes that goes through them and keeps your feet cool.",
120234,5,11/15/2017,Best running shoe ,
120234,5,11/15/2017,Love my new launchers I wear these daily.................feels like I owned them forever.  No need to break in,
120234,4,11/15/2017,Running Club ,
120234,5,11/14/2017,"Launch 4 are really pushing me to the finish line! I normally wear 9.5 size but I decided to get 10 in this model. I am so glad that I did because they fit amazing! My left foot is slightly smaller than the right one, so it feels a little bit loose on that foot, but if I wear thick socks...Voila! Problem solved! :) These shoes are very comfy, very light and provide good grip! True to their name, they ""launch"" me to the finish line! Every time I run with these shoes, I literally feel that they help me run faster! I am a happy runner with the Launch 4! Brooks, you did it again!",
120234,5,11/14/2017,My Boston Marathon shoe! Love it! I alternate between the Ghost and the Launch. The launch being my race shoe!,
120234,4,11/14/2017,They run a half size small Super lightweight but I was disappointed to find it runs a half size too small.,
120234,3,11/13/2017,"Didn't work for me I liked the look of the shoes and overall it was a comfortable shoe, but it seemed smaller than the usual 10.5 I purchase.  In the toe box there was a ridge (for lack of a better word) that kept catching on my toenails.  At first I thought it was just time for a trim, but after cutting them as short as possible, I could still feel something catching.  I think if I went up a size it would have been fine, but I did not attempt this. I have been waiting on the GTS 18 and they were recently released so I opted to go with them rather than trying a larger size on this.",
120234,5,11/13/2017,"Launch is my go-to I've worn the Launch for a few years now and own them in literally almost every color. I run a LOT so I rotate between five pairs regularly. These were specifically purchased as my NYC Marathon shoes, and they were great as expected!",
120234,3,11/13/2017,"Not as good as I thought they would be for the price. Shoes still make my feet go numb when running, was hoping specific running shoes would take care of that.",
120234,4,11/12/2017,"Very good for the money. I do love the feel and look of these shoes. They're also wonderfully priced, not too expensive. However, they are reeeeeeally small. my normal 7.5 size barely fit. I upgraded to an 8 and still ended up with a raw heel and my toes almost touching the front of the shoe.",
120234,5,11/12/2017,cool ,
120234,4,11/11/2017,Fashion meets functionality Supportive for long distance runs but not bulky or heavy. It was an added bonus that they have so many cute patterns and designs to chose from in this shoe.,
120234,5,11/11/2017,"Love! Great shoe, great price, I've gotten lots of compliments on the looks and best yet they are super comfy.",
120234,5,11/11/2017,"Only shoe I'll buy! I am a dog walker.  I am able to adjust laces to accomodate my foot width. Dursble, comfortable and stylish. They are perfect!  #ReviewSweeps",
120234,5,11/11/2017,"Only shoe I will buy I am a dog walker and also walk and hike for exercise. Brooks are the only shoes I will buy for this purpose. Durable, comfortable and support true to my needs",
120234,5,11/10/2017,"Will continue to buy as they wear out I use these shoes for running and for everyday use.  This is my third pair.  The first two  wore a hole in the material on the inner side at the joint between the big toe and the foot.  None of my other Brooks have worn holes, however, these shoes are so comfortable for both running and everyday where I will continue to buy.",
120234,5,11/10/2017,"Great shoe! I found this shoe while Googling ""shoes that help with pain in my arch"". I figured ""why not"" and ordered these shoes. I went for my first run in them and was amazed that they actually took away my arch pain and had the extra cushioning that I needed for the way I run. I am so proud of my choice! I should order another pair just in case they are discontinued.",
120234,5,11/10/2017,Nice!! Very comfortable from the minute you put them on.   Love the color selection too.,
120234,5,11/10/2017,"Love this Shoe! This is my favorite Brooks shoe.  I have tried other Brooks neutral running shoes and thought they were great shoes.  However, I really like the extra spring that the Launch offers.",
120234,4,11/10/2017,Will be buying a second pair I've been very attached to my old running shoes and was struggling to find a replacement pair. But these have lived up to expectations. Lightweight but still comfortably cushioned. I like shoes that barely feel they are there and low arch support. These were perfect for me. Got the beet/pink ones and I am thrilled by its appearance as well as functionality. Planning on purchasing a second pair in a different color soon!,
120234,5,11/09/2017,"Glad I Purchased I really like this shoe!! I have an old version of the launch that I have worn to the ground. This one has a lot more cushion and support which I need with my flat feet, though I always put in my own inserts anyway. I also always order a full size bigger in running shoes than I normally wear because I love having the space for my foot to move and not feel cramped. The shoe feels like it runs slightly small and slightly narrow. I still have room for my foot to move but not as much as I do in other shoes the same size. Materials feel to be good quality and I love the speckled microchip color/pattern! I wish Brooks would make more neutral/less bright colors and patterns in their shoes. Overall, glad I purchased!",
120234,4,11/09/2017,"Nice running shoes but tight on toes and short laces I always buy Brooks size 7.5 and normal width, so I ordered online without trying them on.  This pair feels tight on my toes.  The laces should be a little longer, so I can double knot them comfortably.  The support is excellent as always, perfect for distance running.  I like the style and color.",
120234,4,11/08/2017,"I have 3 pair of brooks, good for walking They not only feel good on ,they also look's nice with what you have on. However I wish I could find them in a lower price start at 60 then go up.",
120234,5,11/08/2017,Love launch ,
120234,5,11/08/2017,"Love these shoes! These shoes were comfortable right out of the box!  I walk/run 20+ miles per week, and my feet are very happy!  They work well for walking, running, and cross-training!",
120234,4,11/07/2017,Very similar to the Launch 3 ,
120234,3,11/07/2017,"Not for high mileage The Launch have been my go-to shoes for years when I was running lower mileage, (15-20 per week) and they were perfect! Very comfortable, and nice and light. When I increased my mileage this season (35-45 per week) I found that they weren't supportive enough for me, and I started experiencing pain along the inside of my shins. I do have a slight heel strike, though, so I'm probably more prone to this type of problem. I was sad to change shoes after so many great years, but I've now switched to the Saucony Ride 10's, and while they're definitely a little heavier, I think their slight sturdiness and support is perfect, and they're very comfortable. Bottom line- the Launch is a great shoe if for speedier workouts, or for lower mileage training, but because it's so light, it's might not have enough support for heavy-duty use.",
120234,4,11/07/2017,"I would buy this product again I use these shoes on the treadmill and road. They take a bit to break in and made my toes go numb, but once broken in they're great.",
120234,4,11/04/2017,Nice ,
120234,5,11/04/2017,I would buy this again I switched to this shoe from the pure cadence and pure flow because I needed more cushion and I am glad I did. I love it!,
120234,5,11/03/2017,"Only shoe for me! This is my fourth pair of Brooks Launch shoes and they are by far my favorite, and my go-to make/model. Love the feel; lightweight but cushioned enough for a slight heel striker. Always get compliments on them too- cant wait to log all the miles on this pair.",
120234,5,11/03/2017,"I'm a Brooks convert. I had a pair of a previous launch version (maybe the launch 2) that a sales associate recommended.  I'm not a runner and wasn't really aware of the Brooks Brand, but those were great shoes so I came back for another pair. I got the gray mesh ones with the teal and lime green accents. They are gorgeous.  I do size up in these shoes for perfect fit.",
120234,4,11/01/2017,"Perfect Minimalist Shoe I love the color options for this sneaker. I have been a fan of the Launch series for a couple years now. I feel like the sneakers are running slightly smaller than in the past. The arch is not noticeable in the sense that the entire shoe feels like an extension of my feet and fits like a glove. My only hesitation to give five stars is I don't know how well the sneaker will hold up, particularly because of the mesh by the toes. #ReviewSweeps",
120234,5,11/01/2017,"Launch Loyal I'm on my third pair of Launch. I was a huge fan of the original pure cadence line. I've ran in the Ghost as well. I like the lighter feel of the Launch, yet the support the shoe offers. It's a good balance between the Ghost and the minimalist shoes. Great for short, speed runs, but also perfect for half marathons. Shooting for a spring full and anticipate sticking with Launch. The 4 felt slightly smaller than the 3 line. I did have to go up a half size.",
120234,4,10/30/2017,I like them! I use them for various types of exercise. When I first starting wearing them my heals had to get used to the back of the shoe rubbing. (I did not wear tall enough socks.) I do love jogging in them now; they have a good amount of cushion in them. I have also gotten plenty of complements about how great they look.,
120234,5,10/30/2017,great comfortable running shoe ,
120234,5,10/28/2017,"BEST PURCHASE EVA Best purchase ever! My feet, knees, and back LOVE ME. I want to buy them in all colors so I can match with every outfit!",
120234,5,10/28/2017,"Easy transition Purchased these to replace my Launch 3's, and the transition to the new pair was seamless...none of the difficulty adjusting to a new pair that can occur sometimes.  And as icing on the cake, the shoe is made in our school colors! ;)",
120234,5,10/27/2017,"Great shoes! I've had two pairs of the Launch 3 shoes and loved them. Getting some new shoes for work where I stand and walk for most of the day, I knew I wanted to get another pair of Brooks. So far I have been very happy with my new Launch 4 Brooks. They're not too bulky like many tennis shoes, and I like the style. They are also extremely comfortable. I'm usually an 8 but wear an 8.5 in these shoes.#ReviewSweeps",
120234,3,10/27/2017,Not Breathable I run between a trail and on the concrete trail.  I loved the Launch 3 shoes.  I loved that they were light weight and not too heavy.  It allowed me to push for more miles and not feel too much as my foot struck the ground.  I had gotten the new Launch 4 with the new material and my feet could not breathe.  My feet also felt unsteady with not having a strong surrounding for my ankles. I am hoping that maybe for winter months as I run outdoors they will be better but wish I had chosen the mesh.,
120234,5,10/27/2017,Great shoe for me Had some of the best runs in a long time since switching to these shoes.  Would buy them again in a min.,
120234,5,10/27/2017,Stylish & Comfortable ,
120234,5,10/26/2017,"Watch me fly The Launch is my favorite shoe. The Launch 3 had some design flaws (IMO) with regards to the stitching in the toe box, I was thrilled to see the 4 doesn't. It gives me great support and comfort for my long runs and is my shoe for the upcoming NYC marathon. I feel like I fly in these energizing shoes. I even bought a second pair, and will probably stock up with more, for my future marathon training needs.",
120234,5,10/26/2017,THE GREATEST! #ReviewSweeps I just ran my first marathon ever in these shoes! I felt confident walking up to the start line because of these shoes. I have been racing in Launch's for about 3 years and I love the feel and comfort of these shoes. Thank you Brooks for helping me reach my running goals!,
120234,5,10/24/2017,This shoe continues to kill it! I buy a new pair of Launches every season and I am thrilled to report that these feel more like the 2s vs the 3s. Super light and springy - I will keep running in these as long as Brooks makes them,
120234,5,10/23/2017,Brooks Runner for life! This is my second pair of Launch shoes and I would not get anything else. I have a crazy weird arch and these are the only shoes that have helped.,
120234,5,10/23/2017,BEST EVER!!! ,
120234,5,10/23/2017,LOVE this product! ,
120234,5,10/22/2017,"Best shoes I've ever had Before these  shoes, I wore a different brand of nice running shoes and I would always have pain in my arches after about 1.5 miles. I thought for a while that I just had problems with my feet but turns out it was just the shoes, whenever I put Brooks on for the first time I was amazed at the comfort. I run faster and I can run miles without any pain.",
120234,4,10/19/2017,"These are decent shoes These are great looking shoes. I got the ""pickled beet"" color. They do seem a little small, but I'm not sure if another size up would be too big. I've had them for a couple months and am mostly happy although they seemed to take some time to adjust to. For the first couple of times, my feet were a bit sore after wearing. I do mostly weights and jumping (no running) so I probably did not need such a cushioned heel. I feel like these aren't as comfortable or flexible. as the GTS for example. They just feel a little stiff for what I do, but overall I'm happy.",
120234,5,10/18/2017,My favorite shoe I love this shoe. I have not been a brooks runner till now.  I tried this shoe on and fell in love.  This is the perfect width for my foot.  It has enough cushion without weighing you down. I hope they don't change this shoe with the next update because it's awesome.  I highly recommend it!,
120234,3,10/18/2017,"So sad this didn't work for me! Ran in these 3-6  miles and each time my right foot went numb- the entire foot, but not the big toe. On some runs my left foot was also numb. This has never happened with other shoes over years as a runner! Ordered the Ghost 10 as a replacement and 3 runs in the right foot is also numb, but not the left at all. I called customer service and they said maybe I should order the wider Ghost, which I have done. Not sure what could cause this?",
120234,4,10/17/2017,"A vast improvement on the Launch 3 I like the feel of the Launch 4 much better than the 3.  The last version had a very high back that rubbed my ankle raw and rendered it unusable for runs.  This version fixed that bug, and has great cushion and shape.  I wish it had a larger toe box and more forgiving structure like the Ghost 10.",
120234,4,10/17/2017,Such High Quality #ReviewSweeps I love these! My old shoes made my feet hurt and these just take my running to a new level. Take some time to break them in. Best running shoes I've ever had. Plus they're v cute which always helps!!,
120234,5,10/17/2017,Perfect! Used them for Chicago Marathon! Love it! I bought the special edition London Marathon 2017 pair and I get a lot of compliments!I found the perfect shoes for my feet!,
120234,5,10/15/2017,I would definitely buy these shoes ,
120234,3,10/14/2017,Doesn't compare to Ravennas or Ghosts Narrow toe and looks great. I would recommend a half size bigger. I returned shoe because not really much support and hurt my ankles when I ran on treadmill. Probably going back to the Ravenna or Ghost.,
120234,5,10/14/2017,"Love the colors! Light, responsive ride. Comfortable. I run 7-15 miles every morning and I depend on a good shoe to provide me with cushion and support. I also love the color options.",
120234,5,10/13/2017,Good shoe! Not a big distance runner - just run/walk in these shoes.  They are comfy from the start - but they do seem to run a little small.  I usually wear 8-8 1/2 and I had to order a 9.  I normally wear an 8 1/2 in Brooks,
120234,5,10/13/2017,"I love this shoe! This is my 2nd pair of this shoe and I love them! I wore the Launch 3 first. I am a marathoner and the quality of my running gear is very important to me. They are comfortable, fit well, are very durable, and I like the color options. If I'm going to be this hard on my body, my shoes better take some of the heat. This shoe sure does. I considered trying something new this time around, but why do that if you know something works for you? I will buy this model again and again.",
120234,5,10/13/2017,"Very Happy with the weight, performance, fit and look. I wear this show to run and attend group fitness classes. Works for all I do!",
120234,5,10/12/2017,"Bought 2 pair so far. Love these! I wore the Adrenaline's for years and recently switched to Launch 4 because I loved the look (finally a model that's not butt ugly). I was hoping for the best with these as I felt the Adrenaline's just aren't  what they used to be. All I can say is  WOW I love the Launch 4.  I bought my initial pair and then my second pair a week later. I wear them to work where I'm on my feet a lot in the medical field, and also  to work out.  I may even buy a third pair as I love the comfort and colors of this line.",
120234,5,10/12/2017,"Nothing but love for the Launch! I've been wearing this snow for years. Not too heavy, still provides solid support, and lasts me more miles than other shoes.",
120234,5,10/10/2017,"I LOVE THIS SHOE!!! The first pair I ordered was the size I normally wear. It was too small, barely. When I would run my toe would touch the tip of the shoe. I waited to return them because they were so comfortable otherwise, as long as I wasn't running. I did finally return them and ordered 1/2 size up and they are the perfect shoe. Seriously thinking about buying more of them in different colors.",
120234,5,10/10/2017,"Love the launch I alternate between two pairs of Launches and love them both. In my experience, the shoe feels a bit stiff for the first 3-4 runs, but after that, it fits like a glove and it's wonderful.",
120234,4,10/09/2017,Yes . I have another pair ( the lobster style!!) I like the launch shoe so far. I am not sure I would use it for the longer runs (over 10 miles) . I tend to go with the glycerin for those. But I want to try it as well. The launch is more narrow on my foot and the toe box therefore is not as wide.,
120234,5,10/09/2017,Loving I love that this shoe has the depth to accommodate custom inserts without my heels slipping. It also doesn't feel like I can count the laces on the top of my feet like other models or brands.,
120234,5,10/09/2017,Launch rocks ,
120234,1,10/08/2017,"Yuck- Bring back Launch 3!! These are the cheapest version of Brooks I have ever owned. I loved the Launch 3, these are worthless. Very disappointed, Brooks. :(",
120234,5,10/08/2017,"love em I bought these because I have ankle issues and needed a neutral running shoe that doesn't force me into supination (as most Nikes do). They are wonderful and comfortable and do not push my gait into any one direction. They are sturdy and provide some stability which I like, although the area around the ankle does dip down pretty low so they do allow for a fair amount of side-to-side movement in the ankle, so I would not necessarily say that these are ideal shoes if you are specifically looking for ankle stability. I am only cleared for walking right now, but I wish I could run in these because I can tell they would feel amazing!",
120234,1,10/06/2017,Not up to normal Brooks Quality I purchased these shoes twice and each time I was very disappointed.  Both pairs developed holes in the sides within 3 months of purchase.  The shock absorbing qualities were gone within about 2 months.  Neither pair held up as well as either the Transcend or the Addictions.  I guess you get what you pay for.,
120234,5,10/06/2017,"Running on clouds Transitioned from Nikes to Brooks with absolutely no issues. These shoes are comfortable, and I feel like I can get the extra mile or two with these!",
120234,2,10/04/2017,"Bottom broke after wearing them about 5 times I got these shoes a couple of months ago and they were super comfortable right out of the box. Unfortunately after wearing them less than 10 times, the bottom started falling off. I used gorilla glue to try to repair it but that only lasted around another 10 wears. Going back to the store isn't an option since we picked them up when we were driving through a city several hours away. Super disappointed in the quality for the price.",
120234,5,10/04/2017,Much better than Launch 3 ,
120234,4,10/04/2017,"4th time buying the launch! This is my 4th time buying the Launch. The colors this time around were a little odd, but I opted for the magenta color. As a college athlete, a comfortable shoe is essential for conditioning. My only complaint about this model is that there seems to be a little bit of extra room in the front of the toes. I tried ordering a size down, but that was not the issue. Regardless, these shoes are familiar and comfortable.",
120234,5,10/03/2017,I would buy this pair again! I use these pair of shoes to run outdoors and they're great! They provide so much stability for a comfortable step. These shoes are great for the avid runner or casual walker as they provide excellent traction. I don't purchase nike shoes anymore after I've discovered brooks. The quality is just so much better. The style of this shoe came as pictured. The only thing I was a bit surprised of was how taller the sole was compared to the launch 3. The shoes can seem a bit heavy for a runner but it takes some getting used to. Its a great shoe regardless and gives you what you need.,
120234,4,09/26/2017,I would buy this pair again Very comfortable shoe. I think this is my 3rd pair. Would recommend it to others.,
120234,5,09/25/2017,"Best shoes I work in the hospital setting so I do tons of walking as a PCT/CNA, I can keep going even after 10,000 steps",
120234,5,09/23/2017,Great running shoes. Would buy again. Shoes are very stylish and super comfortable.  Gotten alot of compliments on my shoes. I absolutely love them. Laces could be a little longer though.,
120234,1,09/22/2017,London 2017 Launch 4 They rub blisters on my heels so I have not been able to wear them much.  I have not had this issue before with  Brooks or any other brand.,
120234,5,09/22/2017,50 miles in I still love these shoes. These shoes have just enough vision for me.  I normally like very little but with the added miles I've been doing I needed just a tad more to keep my feet comfy at the 6-7 miles mark.  That's as far as I run at the moment.  Once I get up to the 10 mile mark I'll let ya know how they feel.  I like how they breath as well.  And they're cute!  Will order these again.,
120234,5,09/20/2017,This is my Second pair of Launch 4- Love them and the color! ,
120234,5,09/20/2017,Definitely would buy this show again ,
120234,5,09/19/2017,"Launch 4 = Launch 2 Revived !!! So far I'm loving the Launch 4!! They feel very similar to the Launch 2, which is great news because I wasn't crazy about the fit of the Launch 3's and decided to skip them. Also, love having color options! Thanks Brooks !!!",
120234,5,09/18/2017,"Very comfortable shoe! I have been wearing Brooks for 5 years, they are comfortable and my go to tennis shoe.",
120234,5,09/15/2017,Best pair of running shoes yet! LOVE THEM! ,
120234,5,09/15/2017,"Super comfy and form-fitting to your feet! I love these shoes. I wear the bioshock shoe inserts in them and they support my feet very well. While they feel snug on my feet, I have never once had any sort of blister or sore spot from running. They are very lightweight and the fabric feels like a glove around my feet.",
120234,5,09/14/2017,"Excellent choice As a PE teacher and a runner, I am always buying Brooks. These are very comfortable and perfect for my runs.",
120234,5,09/14/2017,"Better than the last model! I love this shoe. I've owned the past 2 models and this one is spot on, if not more comfortable. With Brooks, I always take my usual size and never size up and I've been buying them in different styles since 2010! Highly recommend! Will be buying more colors of this style to rotate out.",
120234,5,09/13/2017,"Best Update! Have the Launch 3, don't like them, they were painful, even after just 2 miles. However, I took a chance with the Launch 4, and I am in love with them! I've done a 7 mile speed work in them and my feet didn't hurt. They updated the forefoot, adding more cushion, but it's still super lightweight. Great speed shoe or gym shoe! I got the color 048, and it's a different material than other shoes, and it is my favorite! Doesn't rub, super breathable.",
120234,4,09/12/2017,"I love Brooks, but... I absolutely love Brooks but I won't buy online again. I answered the questions on the site to tell me which would work best and placed my order based on the suggestions. The soles were too level for my flat feet and wearing them hurt my feet. I loved the color and design so I went and got other arch supports for the shoes. I only ordered online because the stores here only had limited availability of Brooks.",
120234,5,09/11/2017,"Love to Launch!! I am a faithful Brooks runner. This is my first pair of Launch and will definitely be my go to shoe. I love the spring I feel with every step. I love how it gives your foot a ""hug"" and has an open toe box.  Highly recommend!!",
120234,5,09/10/2017,AMAZING!!! ,
120234,5,09/10/2017,The most comfortable shoe there is. ,
120234,5,09/09/2017,"I like them, they are comfortable for me. ",
120234,5,09/09/2017,I would buy these again I only use these for short runs 4-6 miles.   I like more cushion in the front of my running shoes for long runs.,
120234,4,09/09/2017,"Speedy and light A little shy of forefoot cushion, but overall nice for tempo days. Otherwise comfortable out of thee box.",
120234,5,09/08/2017,The best purchase I ever made on running shoes! ,
120234,5,09/08/2017,"Love them! I've gone through several pair of Launch 3's, so I was a little nervous when it was time to move on to the 4. But I am not at all disappointed! I will say that the sole is a bit more generous (""stable,"" I guess) in the 4 as compared to the 3, but I've gone on several great runs and I'm loving them!",
120234,5,09/08/2017,COFTY ,
120234,4,09/07/2017,"Loved for long wear, *Runs 1/2 size small I teach & they made the long day on my feet such a pleasant day. I love this shoe. I would order 1/2 a size up because it feels as if it's just a tiny bit snug.",
120234,5,09/07/2017,Great stuff ,
120234,5,09/07/2017,"Loved the launch 3, continue to love the launch 4 ",
120234,5,09/07/2017,Comfort and durability I've found Brooks to be the best value around for comfort and durability.  I rarely wear anything else.  These were for my wife and she loves them.,
120234,3,09/06/2017,Very disappointed! I'm new to brooks as I've been running in mizuno and saucony. I decided to try the brooks launch. When I first started running in them they felt great and I loved them! They felt super good and super cushioned and super right for me! I've only had them for about a month and they started ripping on the front side on both of my shoes! There's thread coming loose on the toe box and on the side of the shoes. The logo color on my shoes started to fade as well. I did not feel like I got my money's worth from these shoes and I am very disappointed.,
120234,5,09/06/2017,Love these shoes I love the redesign to have a sock like feel and there is no rubbing in the toe box,
120234,5,09/06/2017,Launch ,
120234,5,09/06/2017,Brooks Girl I've been a Brooks fan since my first pair which sadly you don't make any more.  My Podiatrist recommends Ultra which are great for letting my feet spread out but Brooks continue to give me the best MPM times.,
120234,5,09/06/2017,Love!! I bought on a whim from a reccomendation I am training for a full marathon so I'm flying through shoes these days. I will definitely purchase another pair in the future,
120234,5,09/05/2017,"I love the Launch 4 The Launch 4 is very comfortable. I have not ran in them yet, but I am a PE teacher and they keep my feet comfy all day.",
120234,5,09/05/2017,"Great shoes! I am not a runner, but had to have the lobsters! They are comfortable for walking.",
120234,3,09/05/2017,"Blisters!! I bought the shoes because I had shin splints from running in old shoes but after breaking my Brooks in, I still had blisters on the back of my ankle. My left ankle had a horrible blister and I couldn't wear the shoes again for a week because it was too painful! I think eventually they will work out but I didn't realize they were going to do that kind of damage! I like the shoes and the company a lot, just not a fan of the pain.",
120234,3,09/04/2017,Returnrd them ,
120234,5,09/04/2017,"Best shoe ever The launch and the ghost are the only shoes I will ever run in.  They are ready to go right out of the box.  The second my foot slides into the shoe, I know it's the right shoe.",
120234,5,09/04/2017,"Love these shoes! I was disappointed with the launch 3.  Although they were comfortable, the mesh top started to tear after only 2 months of wear.  I decided to try this pair because it did not have the mesh top and I love them.  I've had them for about a month, holding up well so far.  Very comfortable, light, breathable, and fashionable.  I am an ER nurse, working 12 hr shifts on my feet.  No foot, leg, or back pain!  I read other reviews that said this shoe ran small and ordered a 1/2 size larger.  Glad I did!",
120234,5,09/04/2017,IT Band pain is almost gone after 3 runs Perfect shoe for me...I have IT band issues but these shoes have given me a great deal of reduction in pain and inflammation already.,
120234,5,09/04/2017,Great sneaker ,
120234,5,09/04/2017,I love these shoes! I wear these to run and also when I work on my feet all day. I used to have aching feet every night until I got my Brooks. Will never buy anything else!,
120234,5,09/03/2017,Love these shoes! I'm extremely pleased with the comfort and durability of these shoes. I also appreciate the fun patterns offered with the Launch series.,
120234,5,09/02/2017,Launch 4 Life!!! I love the Launch. It's my go-to running show for both training and long distance races. (I wear the Hyperion for shorter distance races and speed work and also love those.) I switched over from the Glycerin a few years ago for the lighter weight and have been wearing it ever since. I own the Launch in six colors at any given time and rotate them in my running routine since I run 6-8 times per week.,
120234,5,09/01/2017,"I love the knitt upper! I'm very pleased with the new knitt upper. I've had no issues with blisters, overheating, or too much lateral movement that you find in other brands that have switched to knitt. Also, the Launch 4s have great for all my runs. I've used them for everything from progressives to long slow runs and have had no issues with pain. I currently have about 150 miles on these, and there has been no premature breakdown of the materials. They're a great buy for anyone that likes plenty of toebox room and a little bit of cushioning without that ""running on a mattress"" feeling.",
120234,4,08/31/2017,New running shoes Bought these new sneakers because my old brooks had fallen apart with all my miles. Loved those so I went with another pair of brooks but different style. While they are a nice shoe they fit smaller and aren't as supportive. Would go with brooks again but not this style.,
120234,5,08/31/2017,I would buy these again. ,
120234,5,08/30/2017,Great workout shoe Brooks shoes have been my go to shoe  for at least a decade ever since my podiatrist insisted I make the switch from Nike what he called a fashion shoe.  I've worn them since based on him expert opinion with full satisfaction.,
120234,2,08/30/2017,I would not buy this again I use the shoes for half marathon training and races. Running shoes only. Not enough toe space. Toes hurt after a long run (6+miles).,
120234,5,08/30/2017,Very nice shoes ,
120234,5,08/30/2017,"Love these shoes I've been wearing the Brooks Launch for marathon training for 3 or so years, and I absolutely love it! This season's color selection is also great!",
120234,3,08/30/2017,"Overall good shoe but wore out quickly This is my second review for the Launch 4. I've been working out in my Launch 4s for four months now and sadly even though they still physically look good, I think they are already worn out where my needs are concerned, even though I've probably only put about 200 jogging miles on them. I only wear these to the gym (about 5 days/wk) and I do cross training/ HIIT, a combination of treadmill, rowing, and weight room exercises. They are decent for jogging on the treadmill, but I find that in the weight room they are not as great. They can be kind of slippery on the gym floor when trying to hold planks and for other similar exercises and they don't afford much support for side to side movements, like side lunges or speed skaters. The tongue moving to the side drives me nuts too. I love my PureFlow 6's for jogging, but the rounded heel slips out of the rower heel cup when I wear them for my workouts so I can't really use them for my gym shoe. I might try the new Glycerin 15's next. I loosely recommend the Launch 4 depending on what you are using them for. They are probably just fine for walking/ jogging/ running, but not as great for cross-training. And they come in lots of cute color combos.",
120234,5,08/29/2017,Great shoe I love having a back up pair of shoes for running or cross training in the car these are perfect for what I needed!,
120234,5,08/29/2017,Love the launch! Show is light with just the right amount t of support.  Was struggling with hip pain that went away after changing my running show to sh launch!,
120234,5,08/29/2017,Cute and Comfy ,
120234,5,08/29/2017,"My staple everyday shoe! I use this shoe to walk a few miles a day, to spend a whole day on my feet at work and school, and to workout.",
120234,5,08/28/2017,Launch 4 I use this shoe for work and I am on my feet all day. These are very comfortable.,
120234,2,08/28/2017,Disappointed with new fit I have been wearing your shoes for years... love them... but it seems the newer models have become shorter and narrower.  It started with the Ghost 9... I had to go to a 10.5 and now the Launch are the same.... I am finding I am getting blisters on the sides of my feet which has never happened before and toes are too tight.  Very sad.  I have some of my old ones and they fit great but have too many miles to run in.And in response to the Bottom line question I would recommend them to people but now I would let them know that the fit may be an issue.,
120234,5,08/28/2017,"Best Road Shoe Ever I run on the road everyday and have had many different brands of tennis shoes, and Brooks have been recommended for me and I finally bought them. Well worth the money! Very comfortable and takes no time to break them in!",
120234,5,08/27/2017,Finally found my new go to running sneaker ,
120234,5,08/27/2017,Great shoes They are light yet cushion in the right places. I have less foot discomfort with these shoes.,
120234,5,08/26/2017,Comfortable from the first step completed the Michigan 13.wine..the shoes are awesome. comfortable from the first time I put them on.. I will buy them again and recommend them to my running friends,
120234,5,08/26/2017,"I would definitely buy this product again I train and run marathons, these are my go to shoe. They are comfortable and light, but still offer the support I need. When I put them on my feet, there is a aweeee moment! I've been wearing Launches since the original, the only Launch that I wasn't a super fan of was the Launch 2's. Since then, they out my favorite shoe on the market.",
120234,5,08/26/2017,"I will buy these shoes again. Great shoe and great price. I only wear Brooks, I advertise to all my running friends and highly suggest they try them.",

120234,3,08/23/2017,"Love the design, but the shoe is narrow & not for flat feet Great color and fun pattern. Not the best shoe for people with flat feet. Additionally the shoe feels narrow.",
120234,4,08/21/2017,"Love the Launch, but need a greater variety of colors ",
120234,5,08/21/2017,"Finally found the one! After trying multiple brands and styles, I feel like I finally hit gold with the launch 4. Unbelievably comfortable on long runs and surprisingly responsive for shorter distances. Will be getting another pair for my fall marathon.",
120234,5,08/19/2017,"Love them! I got these shoes after my physical therapist recommended them. I was previously running in Nike Frees and was having terrible shin splints and ankle pain. I couldn't run, and I was in tears trying to get threw my day. I had no idea why it was happening. When I talked to my PT she first yelled at me for running in Nikes, then recommended these. She said it was 100% the shoes I was wearing. I was a bit bummed, and definitely skeptical. But, I ordered them. I liked the feature where you input the size you wear in other shoes, and they'll tell you what to order. I normally wear a 9.5/10, but it recommended the 10.5, which fits perfectly. When these arrived, I ditched my nikes and gave these a whirl. And wouldn't you know it? My shin splints and ankle pain went right away. You can feel the difference. So much support, it's insane! I love these shoes and will never run in anything else again",
120234,5,08/19/2017,"Great Trainer I've been a loyal Ghost runner for years.  I fell in love with them training for my first marathon because they had great ""spring"" through my 40-50 miles/week during training.  I decided to try the Launch 4 for my shorter distance conditioning and speed  training... I LOVE this shoe.  More road feel than the Ghost, and still good energy return.  I wear them for any run up to 9 or 10 miles (anything in double digits and I reach for my Ghosts, though I'm sure the Launch would be fine... I just like more stability over longer distances to help prevent injury).  It's relatively light, the colors are great, and it's a super comfortable neutral daily trainer.  Another excellent shoe from Brooks!",
120234,5,08/18/2017,"I love these shoes! These are my go-to shoe! I've tried others but there are no others like this. For me, the cushioning is just enough, the shoe is comfortable and lightweight. This is my absolute favorite shoe of all time!!",
120234,5,08/17/2017,"Each version gets even better! The Brooks Launch continues to be my favorite running shoe, and I'm so happy that the 4 stays true to the 1-3. It's a bit lighter and feels great for my long runs! I also love the large variety of color combinations.",
120234,5,08/16/2017,"Love The Launch Im about to order my 4th pair of the Launch 4. Perfect shoe for training, speedwork and racing ! No longer need racing flats with this shoe !!

120234,5,08/14/2017,Love the New Launch 4 I love the Launch 4 running shoe! I had the older version of the Launch running shoe and I loved them so much I decided to purchase a second pair. These feel just as great on and I love the purple color. The color looks the same in person as it did online. Definitely happy with my purchase!,
120234,2,08/14/2017,Started out good... I wear these shoes regularly I run 4 days a week the first 2weeks they were excellent... after that they had a  bulging in the arch of my foot.. this is my 2nd pair in a 4 maybe 5 month time spand and the first pair did the same thing. But they are cute..,
120234,5,08/12/2017,"I just bought my third pair of Lauch 4. I run 30 plus miles per week and the Launch 4,  has worked well for me.  I am training for the Marine Corps Marathon and would love to have a Marine inspired shoe color...like Brooks has done for the Boston and London Marathons.",
120234,5,08/11/2017,These are the most comfortable shoes i've ever ran in I've tried several different brands of running shoes and these are by far the best,
120234,5,08/11/2017,"Another successful launch! A very comfortable shoe from the first try on.  I love how it breathes, hugs my foot so well and looks great.",
120234,5,08/08/2017,"Third pair I've transitioned from Ghost to Launch. In the last year I've ran two halfs, a full and currently training for fall half marathons. I struggle with blisters and never have trouble with the Launch (knock on wood!) :) I did have to go up a half size when switching from Launch 3 to 4. Love Brooks!",
120234,5,08/08/2017,"Launch 4 They were supposed to be my indoor shoes, but they are so comfortable I wear them everywhere.",
120234,3,08/07/2017,"Decent for supinators but wore out quickly I've always been a fan of Brooks and on my third pair of the Launch shoes. The previous 2 pairs lasted a reasonable amount of time, but this pair has not held up well. The soles wore down in less than 3 months and I'm sad to say that I'm considering switching brands.",
120234,4,08/07/2017,Great shoes just a little narrow Love love these shoes except the toe box is a little narrow for me. I do have wide feet. I just wish they came in a wide. I do have high arches and the support is good.,
120234,5,08/07/2017,Love my new launch 4 shoes ,
120234,5,08/04/2017,Best running shoe! I have never had a shoe like this before.  The comfort is unreal.  There is so much cushion.  Perfect support for running or walking!,
120234,3,08/03/2017,"Great shoe, but... holes after 7 weeks? I continue to wear the Launch year after year, and I was even one of those that freaked out a few years back when Brooks planned to discontinue the Launch. With that said, I love this shoe...when it works.  I purchased these shoes in late May and they got holes in them after less than two weeks.  I am no Olympian with a crazy training plan, so I really do not understand how the material near the toes is ripping from regular running.  Please Brooks, fix this issue.  It seems to get worse with each new version of the Launch.  I love this particular model, hence why I can't switch to the Ghost, etc.  However, I believe that a shoe should last more than seven weeks without concern.",
120234,5,08/02/2017,"Perfect for work and for working out! I love this shoe! I work in a hospital and the style is great to wear to work. The shoe itself is also great to run in! I haven't experienced any foot or knee pain since wearing these those. Only complaint is that they seem a little thick and can get hot running in the Texas heat. But overall, a fantastic shoe!",
120234,5,08/02/2017,"Love my Brooks! I bought my first pair for work in the hospital (12 hr shifts). I am constantly on my feet running around, and these are perfect. They are so comfortable, and give me a nice spring in my step. The colors are nice. Traction is wonderful. Only complaint is the toe box is slightly narrow which could be why others are going up half a size. No other shoe that I have ever owned compares to these. Love them!!",
120234,3,08/01/2017,"Loved the look, but not the fit on my heels Loved the cute design (I got the Union Jack style), and the shoe bed was very comfortable, but the backs of the shoes are cut entirely too high for my foot and rubbed nasty blisters on the backs of my heels.  Starting wearing taller socks and bandaids which helped, but when I tried to wear my short socks, I got blisters again.  Bummer.  I returned the shoes for my money back.",
120234,4,08/01/2017,"Love these! Love it! Just switched from a stability shoe for marathon training to this for speed training, no complaints after a month of 20 mile weeks. Not quite as springy as expected, but comfortable and I love the colors!",
120234,5,07/29/2017,"My go-to race shoe! When I first heard that the original Brooks Launch shoe was going to be discontinued I bought 4 pairs. I was thrilled that they brought them back! The new Launch 4 is the best ever! Comfortable, light and quick! Besides being a great race shoe, because of its light weight it's the shoe I take when I travel!",
120234,4,07/25/2017,"Looked great, fit a little small I ordered these in a couple of colors to see which I would like better in person. (ordered purple/dazzling blue and the beach glass colors)  Both look great! But the fit was just too small. I recommend, but be sure to order up a half to full size larger.",
120234,5,07/22/2017,New model and loving them! I use the Launch for running and interval training. Light yet supportive. Like the breathable fabric and still provides support.,
120234,4,07/15/2017,Great Shoe!!! Bought these shoes for my new job as an X-ray tech at a big hospital unfortunately I find out a week after working there I can't have mesh. But I wear them daily before and after work. I like the color (I have the teal and grey checkered combo). They are super comfy and I get tons of compliments!!! Only thing is I usually wear a size 9 1/2 but I had to go up to a 10,
120234,4,07/15/2017,Looking forward to seeing next colors ,
120234,5,07/14/2017,my favorite running shoes!! These are my absolute favorite running shoes! I have 3 pairs of the launch 3's and so I thought I would try out the launch 4 and I love them!,
120234,2,07/13/2017,"Not for standing on concrete at work Bought this pair for doing errands and just everyday wear.  Wore them to work for 8 hours as a nurse because I wanted to see if they were worth buying a second pair for work.  Well NO would be the answer.  I stood on concrete for about 4-5 hours and my feet hurt that night and the rest of the weekend when I stayed off of them.  They hurt from the balls of my feet to my heels.  I stayed home that weekend because they hurt sooo bad.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who stands on concrete even though most people recommend running shoes for nursing.  The only thing they didn't do was make my plantar fasciitis any worse.  Haven't worn them since, even around the house.  Waiting for my feet to recover.",
120234,4,07/09/2017,"love thebright color! Im a RN in a busy ER, and these shoes are the only ones,that take the strain of theER,and Never hurt my feet. Ive tried many brands of tennis shoes, and Brooks are the most comfortable fore my long shifts",
120234,5,07/05/2017,Really like my shoes. ,
120234,5,07/04/2017,Fantastic and beautiful shoe I've used these shoes for a 12 hour nursing shift and also to run. No complaints for either.  They're cushioned but not too much and have great support for the ankle.,
120234,5,07/03/2017,"Clouds I have had frequent sprains and fractures to my feet. Because these shoes are light and move with my feet, I run safe and pain free.",
120234,4,07/02/2017,Great shoe! Only negative thing I can say about this shoe is it doesn't breathe at all. A long run creates some serious sweaty feet and that moisture stays locked in the shoe the whole time. I got heel blisters at first but have since switched to my wool blend trail running socks and have had no issues. Not a big deal for me but others might think it's a deal breaker.,
120234,5,07/01/2017,Super Comfortable ,
120234,5,06/29/2017,"Love these shoes! The Launch series has always been 1/2 size too small for me but aside from that, I love this shoe.  I have been wearing Brooks for years and last year I stumbled upon the Launch and decided to try them and I cannot live without them now.  I can run my daily 5-7 miles in them or my weekend longer runs.   Very cushiony but not squishy soft, which I LOVE.  Great neutral shoe. Very light.   I recommend them.",
120234,5,06/29/2017,Love these shoes Everyone loves the fun color scheme and design. The shoes are awesome. I usually order multiple pairs at a time of different colors - they are my everyday shoe for training. Love them 👍,
120234,2,06/26/2017,"A bit disappointed... I tried the Brooks Launch 4 as a replacement for my Saucony Triumphs. I used to run in zero drop shoes, but since bunion surgery about 6 months ago, have had to go with a bit more support. I was hoping the Launch might offer a wider toe box and a bit more underfoot support, but every time I come back from a run, my feet are aching. I do not have wide feet, but I do not feel like my feet are supported well on turns or speedwork. I constantly feel them shifting to the side lining of the shoe, making it feel like I'm going to wear out the upper very quickly. I had returned my initial 8.5 (I'm normally a 7.5 in non-running and always size up) for a 9 and they still feel wonky at the front and mid foot. Anyway, I am likely in the minority as people seem to love these shoes. However, I should note, the colors are super awesome! They may just become my kickin' it shoes.",
120234,1,06/20/2017,"Defect with design Love the shoe, but after only 30 days and 80 street running miles the fabric that connects to the toe guard ripped. Now I'm still waiting on customer service to get back to me on this defect.",
120234,2,06/17/2017,"love the lobster design..... i love the lobster design which is why i bought it, but the shoe is very very stiff and uncomfortable.....even if it was a size larger and wider, would still be stiff",
120234,5,06/16/2017,Love these! Use this for boot camp and for running.  These are very comfortable and very cute.  I like the fun design.  Looking forward to wearing them for 4th of July run.,
120234,5,06/15/2017,Absolutely love these shoes!!! ,
120234,5,06/15/2017,"I would buy this product again I run in the glycerines, but really loved this print. So I bought them to wear to work; ED RN. They get a lot of steps and are great!",
120234,5,06/10/2017,"This is my 4th pair of Launch.  These shoes fit so well. I wear Brooks only, and have for about 7 years.  If you take care of your shoes and wash them monthly, they will last for years, plus they still look new.",
120234,5,06/08/2017,Love these shoes ❤️ I love love love my Brooks Launch. Only shoes I wear plus the special edition patterns are adorable!,
120234,4,06/04/2017,"Good starter shoe I wore the Launch for 2 years in the past. I loved the style until I started training for longer and longer races. Unfortunately, I have wide toes and the Launch is just a tad too narrow for my toes. I love the fit and the comfort of these shoes but needed to switch to something with a wider toe box. Would definitely recommend for someone with slender toes.",
120234,5,06/04/2017,So comfortable! This shoe is perfect for walking my dog and hiking through the hills. Comfort and style for dashing around doing errands too.,
120234,5,06/03/2017,"For Fitness & Boston! I love these shoes! I've had a hard time finding shoes that fit my somewhat narrow feet. The top of my foot is fairly flat so if I pull hard on the laces to tighten the fit, the two sides often touch or overlap. My dress shoe size is an 8 1/2. However, every time I buy running or tennis shoes I need to buy 1 whole size up. I don't know why the manufacturing of these shoes fits differently but its been this way consistently for years! The larger size the gives me room in the length but too wide on the sides. My conundrum!These Brooks fit perfectly! (Yes I bought a size up: 9 1/2) The sides are a soft fabric which molds over my instep. The soles are wide and stable. Overall the weight is light and the insides are very foot hugging and cushioned. Loving the Red, White and Blue colors. Lots of compliments from folks! This is my first pair of Brooks and it won't be the last! Here's to Boston, fitness and Lobster!",
120234,5,05/31/2017,comfortable and great function! ,
120234,5,05/30/2017,Pure Connect Replacement! I finally found a replacement for the Pure Connect shoes!  They discontinued my favorite shoes.  It was very difficult to find a replacement.  Thankfully I found the Launch 4!  VERY responsive!  I understand why they named it the Launch.  You can feel the spring back when running.  I run on my forefeet with high arches.  Lots of cushioning but doesn't weigh you down.  Like the energy storing capabilities.  BROOKS- PLEASE DON'T TAKE THESE AWAY FROM ME!! :)  Will be buying lots of these running shoes.  Lobster print is really cute too!,
120234,5,05/30/2017,Love these shoes.  Lots of positive comments. I use this shoe as part of my regular wardrobe.  They are great for just about anything.  I don't actually use them for running but for comfortable walking in everyday interactions.,
120234,5,05/25/2017,Love these shoes!  I want more. I wear orthodics in my shoes daily.  So I bring my own arch.  So I really can't comment on the arch support.  Put down good in the survey.  I love the shoe.  I have bunions and these shoes do not irritate them.,
120234,3,05/18/2017,"GREAT... BUT I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable on my feet and my knees. My best friend recommended these and even helped me find the perfect pair (lots of royal blue and pink). I absolutely LOVE them. My knees don't hurt, my feet don't hurt... I could walk FOREVER in them and not have any issues. BUT I purchased them in the middle of March 2017 and it is May 18th... the material at the toes on the outside just at the corners of the toe piece already have holes in them... I need shoes that are going to LAST for at least 6 months or more especially if i am going to pay this price for them. I am so disappointed that not even 3 months in they are doing this. I do not wear them daily so I know it is not the wear and tear on them that has caused it.",
120234,4,05/16/2017,"Comfortable but not for running for me! I bought these for running, but the cushioning wasn't solid enough for me to use running.  I am keeping them for walking around town though and am going back to my Brooks GTS for running.",
120234,5,05/15/2017,"buy the shoes!! This is my 3rd pair of Launch's. I began running 1yr ago with a pair of Launch 2 that I had purchased years before solely for the looks. Since I had been working in them for some time, they only provided comfort for 2 months of running 3x week. I decided to go to a local running store and have them fit me for shoes. I purchased an exotic brand that looked super cool, but ended up killing my knee after only a month. So back to Launch I went. Launch 3 saw me through countless 5k's, a 10k and almost to a half marathon before giving out. So much to my dismay, I took my husband's advice and bought a pair of Asics since he felt like Brooks were wearing out too soon. 3 weeks later I could barely walk, even days after running. Back to Brooks I happily went. I purchased the super cool peacock print, but was concerned about the material and it's breathability since it was different than the mesh I was accustomed to. So far I have not had any issues. Finished my half marathon with no foot or shin pain whatsoever. I have learned my lesson, and I will never leave Launch again.",
120234,5,05/15/2017,"Great all-around running shoe Have used for running, biking, walking, will be training for a marathon in them!",
120234,5,05/13/2017,Great shoe!  Ran half-marathon in May and they were perfect! ,
120234,3,05/12/2017,"Great support- dislike the toe I like these shoes. They are lightweight and offer great support for running. Unfortunately I attempted to do a set of burpees in them and my big toe kept hitting and my nail catching on the toe support which is in a plastic interior support.  It felt like it was going to rip my toe nail off. So all in all, these are a nice running shoe, but it's uncomfortable for me to do any other exercise in them.",
120234,5,05/12/2017,Happy Feet I purchased these after my go-to Saucony shoes were discontinued. The second I put them on I fell in love. They are super comfortable and lightweight plus they are pretty!,
120234,5,05/09/2017,"Brooks Launch 4 are my go to marathon shoe. Brooks Launch are my go to shoe.  I have used them in several marathons including Boston (2013).  The latest version is my favorite by far.  I feel added cushion and comfort, but not added weight.  I also feel they are highly responsive, giving my foot a forward bounce with each step.   I am a certified running coach through RRCA and I have trained many athletes young and old.  I am always raving about Brooks because the shoes are solid, reliable, consistent and above all; Brooks stands by their product.  I love that I can tell my clients to try them out, knowing Brooks will take them back without question if the runner in unhappy.",
120234,5,05/07/2017,"LOVE my Launch 4's I have owned a lot of  Nike's, Rebok, Sauconey,...YOU NAME IT!  Brookes are the MOST comfortable sneaker I have every purchased!!",
120234,4,05/01/2017,"These Shoe's Relieved my Runner's Knee! I've been wearing Brook's PureConnect since that line launched, and loved the minimal feel of the shoe, but recently began to have a lot of knee pain when I ramped up the length of my runs. My running store suggested I switch to a more padded shoe, so warily accepted the advice and went home with a pair Launches. At first, this shoe felt noticeably heavier than I was used to with the PureConnect, and I had to adjust my landing toward the mid-food, where I was previously landing closer to the ball, but I got used to these changes within a week. I've had the Launches for 2 months now, and I'm very satisfied. They're comfortable on long runs, but they aren't too bulky for speed work either. Most importantly, my knees haven't hurt at all since I started wearing these. I think the Launch is my new go-to!",
120234,4,04/29/2017,"Lobster shoes I loved everything about this shoe, and I ordered it because of the royal blue color which I have been looking for. But the pictures of the red lobsters I don't like. I would keep this shoe if the lobsters were not on them.",
120234,5,04/28/2017,Notice me shoes Wore these on a recent half marathon and loved the comfort and fit.  No blisters or discomfort.  Many people complimented the lobster design.,
120234,4,04/28/2017,"Attractive and comfortable I tried a bunch of different types of Brooks shoes and had to return 4 pair before realizing that the main problem was that my sneaker size had gone up a half size since I bought my Glycerin 13's a couple years back. Amazing customer service with returns, by the way! Brooks is #1. They even refunded me for shoes that had mud caked deep into the tread when I decided I needed to go up a half size. Anyway, it was a long path to find the Launch 4, which I am overall happy with. I feel like they are adequately cushioned and provide stability and support without being too stiff. They are nice and lightweight. I do need to wear higher socks with them or the heel rubs and the tongue shifts to the side despite the fact that the lace threads through a loop on the tongue. Those are my only real complaints. I actually prefer the feel and fit of my PureFlow 6's to the Launch 4, but the rounded rubber of the heel of the PureFlow 6 keeps me from being able to use the rower at my group fitness class (my foot pops out of the heel strap). So I am using my Launch 4's for my gym and PureFlow 6's for everything else.",
120234,3,04/26/2017,Too Small! ,
120234,5,04/24/2017,Very comfie!  Love these lobster design. I literally walk miles at work.  These keep my feet comfortable all day and night.,
120234,5,04/24/2017,"Loved the Shoe and definitely getting another pair Just got the London Limited Edition Launch 4 (I have this obsession with all things London, so I had to have them) and wore them today for the first time for a 4 mile race.  OMG they are amazing.  I've been looking for a lightweight shoe and one that my running coach recommended I use on just race days.  Well I found it.  I took almost 2 minutes off my old PR on a 4 mile race.  Definitely be purchasing another pair for my training runs.",
120234,3,04/23/2017,"Wears quickly I have been running the Launch for years. This is a great shoe; however, it wears out extremely quickly.  Within one month of 35 mile weeks there were holes around the toes.  Launch 3 were the best, I wish Brooks would stop changing the model. As many of the other reviews mention, the shoe is much more narrow than the Launch 3 and pinches.",
120234,3,04/23/2017,"Not like the launch 3 My first experience with Brooks shoes were the Launch 3 and I absolutely loved them, they were very supportive, lightweight and perfect for long runs. When I began marathon training in January I purchased the Brooks Launch 4 because I loved the 3 so much and they were not the same at all. The Launch 4 felt much narrower than the Launch 3 and less supportive/less cushioned. At first the shoes felt great, but as my runs became increasingly longer, they became by far one of the worst shoes I've ever owned. I received blisters, numbness in my feet from the tightness of the shoe and increased knee pain from the lack of support. I had originally thought these symptoms were because the shoes were not broken in enough but I was horribly mistaken. I eventually used these to run a marathon as it was too late to break in new ones and it resulted in bruised toe nails, loss of feeling in my feet during the run (for 10 miles!) and blisters on my toes and under my feet! I certainly would not purchase these shoes again.",
120234,5,04/21/2017,THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE SHOE FOR BOSTON I used it to walk around Boston prior to the marathon. I am now sporting them just as work shoes.,
120234,5,04/20/2017,So comfortable! I haven't run in these and not sure I will but they are the most comfortable sneaker I've worn in a long time!,
120234,3,04/20/2017,"Wish they fit!!! I was looking for a light responsive shoe for my < 10 mile tempo runs and occasional track workouts.  I have high arches, mostly strike midfoot, and my toes point out slightly.  These shoes seemed like it.  I have run in several Brooks and Asics shoes since I started running seven years ago and a women's size 10 always fit.  Not these shoes!  I took them for a couple of runs and both times the toes on my right foot got numb.  I tried a 10 1/2 just in case, but they were too big to the point where I couldn't tie my shoes without bunching the fabric in the front.  Luckily, I thought to look for a try a size 10 in last year's model (Brooks Launch 3) and those fit great!  So sad that the sizing in these seems off.  I would give the Launch 3's five stars!  I stocked up on Launch 3's but I hope that sizing is not an issue in future versions of the shoe.",
120234,4,04/20/2017,Boston Marathon Shoe ,
120234,4,04/20/2017,A Pinch of Envy I love the Launch 4! I own 2 pairs - one for training and one Boston Marathon pair for the big race. This sneaker more closely resembles the Launch 2 which was my absolute favorite. Launch 4 is narrower than the 3 for sure.Be sure to get fitted though! I am a runner and coach and some teammates say it is too narrow for them personally.,
120234,2,04/20/2017,I would have to go another whole size bigger I own a training facility in Winthrop and I'm on my feet all day I run in ghost 9 which I love bought these for work and walking my dog. Way too tight but look good. Would have to go up another whole size   I wo,
120234,5,04/20/2017,Best sneaker ever! ,
120234,5,04/20/2017,Best launch so far I run about 35-40 miles/week and need cushioning.  Was able to wear these right out of the box in half marathon.  Great for supinated high arched foot.,
120234,5,04/20/2017,Extremely satisfied I bought these shoes for work and love them so much I am going to buy another pair for running.,
120234,3,04/19/2017,"Not like Launch 3 I have been wearing Brooks for years and have always been super happy with every pair until this pair. I have been wearing the Launch 4 for approx 1 month and they are already coming apart. Not as comfortable as Launch 3 or other styles. They have tore up my Right heel for some reason, its as if the back of the shoe is to high. When you pay as much for a pair of shoes as Brooks cost they should last for longer than a month.",
120234,5,04/18/2017,"Fast and Smooth These are great, fast, responsive shoes.  I was looking to switch from a cushioned shoe to a more responsive, springy shoe after losing 20 pounds and refocusing from distance to speed.  These fit the bill.  I almost immediately took an extra 15 seconds per mile upon switching to these.  They're responsive and lightweight enough for speed, but comfortable and durable enough to run for relatively high mileage, at least in the few weeks I've owned them.  Only cons is they are a little bit stiff feeling, and on surfaces that slope slightly- like the side of the road- my forefoot tends to slide a little inside the shoe, making me feel a little unstable.  I'm a little afraid I might roll an ankle at some point in these.  I guess that's the price I pay for a flexible, fast shoe.  All in all, great shoe.  Using for training and races, since I can't afford a just-for-racing shoe at this point. :)",
120234,5,04/17/2017,The right running shoe is priceless!! ,
120234,2,04/11/2017,didn't work for me Unfortunately didn't work for me. Does not seem to have as much cushion and either the arch support is not as good or is in a different spot (farther back) than the last version. Had to return them.,
120234,5,04/05/2017,"I Love Brooks shoes!! I simply love everything about the Brooks line! The fit, comfort & cost! I can honestly say that I would not purchase any other active wear shoe.",
120234,5,04/02/2017,"I would recommend this product I have flat feet and use wide orthotics with a high arch and that are. I bought the normal width shoes because the wide width were out, but the normal width has worked out great! The shows are very comfortable and are working well with the orthotics which is most important for me. I'm on my feet a lot wearing my new Brooks and they've been good to me so far!",
120234,5,04/02/2017,Happy overall with fit. They give added spring to your step. ,
120234,3,04/02/2017,"I like the shoes, but not as supportive I like the look of these shoes, but they are not as supportive as Brooks I have purchased in the past. My feet feel ""achy"" after a run. And, the shoe feels a little narrow, crowding my outer foot.",

120234,5,03/29/2017,Love them I'm a nurse and these are the only shoes I have found that don't cause the burning and fatigue in my legs that all the others I've tried do!,
120234,5,03/29/2017,"Launch 4 are amazing! Love these light weight, comfortable and cushion packed shoes. Brooks is the best, I have loved every pair purchased!!",
120234,3,03/29/2017,"Slight problem I love e everything about this shoe except for the durability. I run 60+ miles per week and ham on my 2nd pair of the 4s. Both pairs developed a hole over the little toe area very quickly, one after only a week of use! I keep wearing them because I love the shoe's fit, but I wish I didn't have to use duct tape on week old shoes.'the 3s never did this and I had 6 pairs of them.",
120234,5,03/28/2017,Love my new shoes. ,
120234,4,03/27/2017,Super comfortable except that the backs rub my ankles raw. ,
120234,1,03/26/2017,I need extra wide shoes ,
120234,5,03/23/2017,"Great lightweight shoe! I needed a nice lightweight, speedy shoe & this is the one! It's springy & still comfy. I love the width & stretchiness of the upper. I also love the really cute print that gets noticed in the best way!",
120234,5,03/23/2017,Love these shoes I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes.  They make my feet feel wonderful.,
120234,4,03/22/2017,Koi Shoes ,
120234,5,03/22/2017,best generation yet i thought i loved the other 3 generations but the 4th is even better! awesome shoe,
120234,3,03/22/2017,"Pretty good endurance running shoe, not 100% happy though. Aesthetically, the shoes are great.  They have adequate cushion and flexibility for a neutral, lightweight training shoe.  However, I bought my typical running shoe size at first and had to return for a half-size up.  The new size is still a little short/narrow on my feet and toward the end of an endurance run (12+ miles) my big toe always feels like it is being poked - so strange.  Also during the end of a longer run, the pads on the outer edges of my feet start to hurt.",
120234,4,03/22/2017,This is about my tenth pair and they fit like a glove. ,
120234,5,03/21/2017,"Awesome These shoes are great...super lightweight but with enough cushioning to be very comfortable.  They feel a bit wider than the Launch 3, which is probably good for a lot of people but possibly less ideal for me.  Overall, I am very happy with them. Love the Tokyo Edition!!!",
120234,5,03/19/2017,"I would definitely buy this shoes again! The Launch 4 is much better than the launch 3. The toe box is not as narrow as the 3. It's very light and airy. I am a recreational runner and the longest distance since I got them has been 5 miles and the arch support is great. Very similar to the launch 2, but with a better color selection and better traction.",
120234,4,03/17/2017,Best injury recovery shoe I have ever worn. I have a torn ligament in one foot and a broken toe in the other.   I have been wearing these as my recovery shoe.  They have been perfect for comfort and accommodating the toe wrap.,
120234,5,03/16/2017,"Second pair, still love it! I run 5Ks to Half Marathons and these are great.  I like them better for shorter distances while I prefer the Ravenna for the longer distances, but these are great for speed.  I love the new color.  Definitely keeping this in my rotation.  I have a wider foot and the roomy toebox is great too!",
120234,4,03/15/2017,Would recommend ,
120234,5,03/15/2017,"Love the Launch 4 The Launch 4 remind me of my Launch 2's from Brooks -- they're stable in the heal and give my injured ankle support, they're springy and really do ""launch"" you into each step. I could walk or run all day in them. They seem very durable so far and the bigger sole provides some protection if you're running over rocky areas or through a puddle.",
120234,5,03/15/2017,"Launch 4 is a huge success!! This is my second pair of the Launch and I just LOVE them - maybe even more than my first! I previously ran in the Launch 2, but I feel that the Launch 4 could possibly surpass them. I ran 6 miles in them straight out of the box and felt like they were made for me. My feet felt fresh and energized and my run felt springy. I'm looking forward to running another half marathon in the Launch!",
120234,2,03/14/2017,"Disappointed I have owned multiple pairs of Launch 3 (which I love).  I really wanted to love these updated shoes but after numerous runs, I just could not keep them.  They are supposed to have more cushioning in the forefoot but they actually felt harder on my feet.  My legs hurt after using them.  I will stick with the Launch 3 for now.",
120234,5,03/13/2017,"Great Energetic Shoe This is the first pair of Brooks I've purchased after testing several models at a local store.  The rep recommended the Launch 4 for me, but it wasn't in stock, so I hesitantly ordered online.  Best decision ever-I feel like a gazelle in these shoes!  They add a ton of energy to my run while still having a moderate amount of cushioning.  I can absolutely notice the ""spring"" in these shoes which has been absent in others.  I bought the Koi style because I wanted something fun to motivate my runs, but this shoe is now my new favorite for multiple reasons!  Only complaint-I have a blister on my heel, but that may be my fault for not wearing the proper socks (I read reviews on the Launch 3 and this was a concern there as well).",
120234,5,03/12/2017,"Great shoe It has taken me a long time to find a shoe I really like. I bought these on Thursday and did a 5k today- best time yet. They are light, flexible and cushioned without making me feel bogged down.  My feet are a little wide but without stiff overlays these feel ""neat"" but not too tight. Overall I'm very impressed and super happy I tried these!",
120234,5,03/10/2017,"Launch 4 Fits great, I used to have lots of knee and ankle pain with other running shoes (not Brooks), and have no problems with this one so far. It is very comfortable, provides good support and cushion while still not being heavy. I already recommended it to friends!",
120234,5,03/07/2017,"New favorite These are my new favorite running shoes! Bought larger than normal for tie room. Love the knit type too material, compared to net top on my other launch 4 shoes.",
120234,5,03/07/2017,Comfort & color I love the fabric - prefer it to usual netting. Very comfy with my orthotics.,
120234,5,03/06/2017,"Light, comfortable shoe Bought this shoe after a pair of Aasics wore out on me too quickly. This is a great shoe - I normally wear an 8.5 but bought a 9 based on other reviewers' advice and am glad I did. This shoe is extremely light weight whereas the Aasic I previously owned was on the heavier side. Good support and cushion though feel like there isn't as much stability as other shoes (I realize this shoe isn't marketed as a stability shoe so that makes sense). Very breathable which is important for me since I live in the south and running during the warmer months can be arduous! I've only been running in them for a month so we'll see but so far so good!",
120234,5,03/06/2017,Koi Launch Love the print.  I am always looking for something different and fun yet functional for my workouts.  I have several pairs of Launch Brooks and love them for my indoor gym/ tread workouts.  They do run a little small so I ordered these a 1/2 size up and the fit is perfect with thin socks.,
120234,5,03/06/2017,"Happy to have a women's running shoe that is not pink Usually run in the Ghost. I thought this would have way less stability but it doesn't. I like the theme shoe, I've received many compliments, and they dry quickly. Please continue to offer cool shoes in women's sizes that aren't traditional ""girl"" colors.",
120234,4,03/05/2017,"Comfortable, swift, and cute Absolutely love the colors. These shoes are flexible and very lightweight. Wish they had slightly more support but otherwise am really loving them for running and going to the gym.",
120234,5,03/05/2017,"Brooks Launch for life! The Launch is my go-to running shoe, and as an endurance athlete packing on the miles, I own several pairs that I rotate. I previously wore the Glycerin (also a great shoe), but I switched to the Launch a couple years ago and have really appreciated the lighter weight and flexibility. I have plantar fasciitis issues, so I wear custom insoles, and they fit perfectly in the Launch. Plus, I love the Tokyo edition's style and am always a fan of the special additions Brooks releases. The shoe also stands the test of intense Florida heat and humidity, which not many products can claim. Brooks fan for life!",
120234,4,03/04/2017,"SUPER cute, but definitely not my favorite for running. I bought these for running, but the first time I wore them I ended up with a blister on my heel.  They fit perfectly and feel very comfortable, but somehow they rubbed.  I switched to a different kind of sock for the next run and that issue resolved, but I still didn't love the feel of them during the run.  I like more of a solid base under the front of my foot if that makes sense - these are maybe a little bit too lightweight/thin for me or something.  Hard to explain.  They are SUPER cute and they are very comfortable for walking and working out at the gym.  I just won't wear them when I run.",
120234,5,03/04/2017,"Launching from Texas! Style is outstanding. Love the colors in and out. Great motto/slogan- inspirational message. Fits exactly true to size and extremely similar to the overall sit and comfort of Launch 1-3. This matters because other shoes tend to vary from the ""original"" and a runner needs the same level of quality and support when they have identified a shoe that suits their needs. I run without socks occasionally to test the comfort of the shoe and gauge the traction, in order to determine if I can run on slick or wet surfaces. This shoe is not best for those conditions, but I never expected any of by Brooks Launch to do so. This is my training shoe and the best shoe for 10k, half marathons and treadmill runs. There are lights shoes on the market for a 5k, if needed; however; if you are not running below an 8:00 minute mile, the Launch 4 will do.",
120234,5,03/03/2017,"Great shoe! I'm an avid Brooks wearer and I swear they get better with each generation. The Launch 4 is my favorite yet. It's super comfortable, responsive, light weight, and helps to naturally push you forward in your stride. I was a little disappointed with how quickly the mesh/plastic near the toes wore out on the Launch 3, but with what I can tell so far it looks to have been resolved on the Launch 4 since the positioning of the plastic doesn't extend as far down. Thankfully! Overall, the Launch 4 is a great shoe that I'd highly recommend.",
120234,5,03/03/2017,Really comfortable shoe ,
120234,1,03/03/2017,"I would not buy this product again. I really wanted to like this shoe, I love the look of it and had high expectations. I am training for my second half marathon and have been exploring different shoe options. Brooks seemed to be high on the list of recommended shoes for distance runners but I am very disappointed with their performance. One of the downfalls is the back of the shoe comes up way to high and is very stiff. I could feel the shoe digging into my Achilles and after just a few runs could feel my feet and particularly my Achilles' tendon hurting even throughout the days that I haven't worn the shoes. I am currently in the process of getting them returned. I feel that if I kept wearing them I would have ended up injured because of the shoes themselves. Another downfall is that there seemed to be little to no cushioning and were very stiff in the sole. This was my first Brooks purchase, I'm sure their other shoes are great for some, but I would not recommend the Launch 4 to anybody for any purpose.",
120234,5,03/03/2017,I absolutely love the launch 4 the best sneaker! Have bought I have 2 pair one for running indoors only and the other for everyday walking use.  They are truly amazing sneakers!!!,
120234,3,03/02/2017,"Different Shoe altogether This shoe is comfortable to walk in, but not as durable than the Launch 3. I ordered these expecting similar specs and support, when in fact, I just jacked up my knee on a recent run after breaking the shoes in. Very frustrated and disappointed. Why did you have to drastically change the same shoe I've been wearing for the past several years?",
120234,2,03/02/2017,"Disappointed...again I loved my Original Launch and had zero complaints/issues with them.  They held up well on long runs, a few marathons, and as an every day shoe after they were retired.  As they were ""improved"" with each version, however, the Launch became worse for me.  The 3s were so tight, they pinched my toes and made my feet fall asleep.  I have narrow feet so I probably would have had to get a wide width.I was hoping for a better fit in the 4s.  Unfortunately, not so much.  I tried on my size and they were too small...my big toe was smashed into the end.  So I tried on 1/2 size bigger and they were gigantic.",
120234,5,03/01/2017,"Fit much better than the 3! I first tried the Launch 3, and I loved them, but they ran pretty short.  These are much more true to size, but kept the lightweight no shoe feel that I love.  I run about 30 miles a week and prefer shoes I forget about when I run, these are them!  Just right.",
120234,5,02/14/2017,I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Launch 4!!! I am a Launch girl. I loved the Launch 2 was super sad with the Launch 3. I usually go through 3 pairs a year! The last Launch 3 I bought fit great as usual but they started giving me blisters. I didn't even wear them out. Luckily the New Launch 4 came out so I jumped on them and bought the purple/Pink ones. LOVE THEM they remind me so much of the Launch 2. I just ordered the New Tokoyo Koi's for both me and my husband (who is also a Launch fan) and I really can't wait to get them!!!,
120234,5,01/23/2017,"Perfect! Like Launch2 My favorite was the Launch 2. Launch 3 was too narrow and had an awkward fit, but Launch 4 is right back where I want them to be, just like Launch 2. Glove like fit, light weight, and even though they're a ""neutral"" shoe they give you just a hint of stability. Love!",
120234,3,01/15/2017,"DO NOT BUY Bought these shoes because I thought they would be great for gym use and the occasional run. They are so comfortable however, I have had these shoes less than 3 months and they already are getting holes in the toe area. I am extremely disappointed as I have NEVER had any of my shoes that are >1 year old have any sort of hole in them. I can't wear them anymore because each time I wear them a new hole seems to appear. Poor quality and material.",
120235,5,10/07/2017,Not another shoe can compare. It's like walking on air!! ,
120235,5,09/29/2017,"Nice running shoe! After hearing how great Brooks shoes were, I decided to give them a try. These shoes are very comfortable. I did the survey online and was given a couple of recommendations.  I decided to go with the Neuro 2. This is is very lightweight (which too me a little bit to get used to) but after running in them for a couple weeks, I am happy with this shoe. I did buy a half size bigger than I normally wear and I am happy I did. This shoe fits like a glove!",
120235,5,09/17/2017,I would definitely purchase this style again! ,
120235,5,09/15/2017,I would buy this product again and again! I love them! ,
120235,5,09/08/2017,Like floating on air! I was looking for a shoe not too bulky but not sacrificing support.  This is it!  I normally wear a 9 but got 9.5 to give more room.,
120235,5,07/27/2017,"Feels like pillows around my foot I've worn Brooks for several years and when I buy them I always buy 1 whole size up.  I run 5 days a week, I need the extra room.  They have always run a size small for running, and half size small for regular wear.",
120235,5,07/22/2017,The best running shoes I own I walk 6.5km per day.  This is my first pair of Brooks shoes so far the best runner shoes   for me.  Love its' stability and comfortability.  I love walking more now.  The streamlined head is beautiful!,
120235,1,07/04/2017,"It's not my favorite shoe. All of the pressure goes to the toe of the shoe. I've relaced them and it's helped some. I am on my feet all day at work and by the end of the day, my feet are killing me. I'm so disappointed.",
120235,5,06/10/2017,"A good and speedy shoe I am an avid Hyperion (formerly T7) fan, but I needed a training shoe for most of my miles (which are not racing or speed intervals).  I have walked, jogged, ran and even a bit of speed in them.  I am surprised how much I like these shoes as I typically don't like heavier shoes.  These are a keeper.",
120235,5,05/09/2017,So far so good! I am an 8.5 but bought a 9 because we do a lot of running. I am a Camp Gladiator junkie and have had these 2 months with no issues! :),
120236,5,12/27/2017,I would buy these again So comfortable to my feet. Bought two pairs in different colors. Love the light weight construction.,
120236,5,12/26/2017,"Yay!  The Pure Cadence I love are back! I loved the Pure Cadence 1 and 2 for my runs especially long runs.  Best running shoes for my feet.  Then the shoe changed and I stopped buying Pure Cadence.  I could only use the newer Pure Cadence for my other training, but not for long runs.  I was frustrated because I could not find another running shoe that truly felt comfortable like the old Pure Cadence.  When I saw the reviews on the 6, I decided to give it another try and they were on sale, too.  Woohoo!  My favorite running shoes are back!  So happy that I ordered another pair to keep in my stash!  Please, please don't change!  Happy feet again.",
120236,5,12/26/2017,Love THESE running shoes ,
120236,4,12/18/2017,"Improved from last two versions! I too am a version 2 fan, but with those days gone I would say version 6 is the next best thing. Definitely a great improvement from version 4 and 5 which got a lot of poor reviews. Those shoes hurt. I was delighted to run in these. Brooks seems to have reverted back to prioritizing structure, and dropped all the excessive, flashy accessories. Thank goodness. I also appreciate the gray and black versions for women.  Ureeka, not every woman desires purple and pink. Let's get some lime greens and bright oranges as an option and then I'll be completely sold.",
120236,4,12/14/2017,Love Lightweight but provides supports. I have flat feet so finding comfortable running shoes is difficult.,
120236,5,11/28/2017,Great support and comfortable I am a homemaker and up and about 12 hours/day. This model provides me with the comfort and support that I need. I also use it when I exercise on the treadmill and the shoes are great.,
120236,1,11/26/2017,Wish they still made the 2 or the 3 =( I kept having pain in the back of my lower ankle and I couldn't figure out why.  I tried everything.  Finally went to the Dr. and she took some x-rays and everything looked fine.  She had me put my shoes on and noticed that the part where I felt the most discomfort was right where the shoe hit the back of my ankle.  Finally looked at the specs and noticed that its 1mm lower than the pair I previously wore... anyone know of a light weight shoe with a 5mm drop that they'd recommend?,
120236,5,11/25/2017,"Love! I am a ""newer"" runner and have had these for almost 5 months. I. Love. Them. Just waiting to get a second pair so I can start rotating more and won't have to break them in immediately. Lightweight which was important to me and I don't have pain due to impact. I don't run more than a 10K but not because of the shoes.",
120236,4,11/20/2017,"Smaller than the 5 Great shoe, but at least a half size smaller than the 5. Much better design than the 5, just need to size up!",
120236,5,11/05/2017,Absolutely great ach support when running. Wear for hiit classes as well with no discomfort,
120236,5,11/03/2017,"Brooks NEVER disappoints!! I have owned several pairs of Brooks running shoes now.  I have never been disappointed in the quality of the shoes.  They are comfortable, durable, and you can get a ton of runs in with these shoes. Love them!!",
120236,4,10/26/2017,"Good running shoe, but not an upgrade from PureCadence 4 I previously owned the Pure Cadence 4 (best running shoes ever) and the transition to Pure Cadence 6 seemed the next step. But while these are good running shoes, they are less comfortable and offer less support than Pure Cadence 4. I do like the aesthetics of the Pure cadence 6 more (I have the black-purple one), the style can be worn in casual outfits and not look too much as running shoes.The shoe laces are quite stable, as I'm not the best at tying laces.As background, I have a high arch and I'm an underpronator, so I require lots of support. I make a long run of 10-12km once a week and a shorter 20-30 minutes (I do strength training and crossfit with other shoes in between). During the short runs these are great, but on long runs or trail runs these do not offer the same support and stability as the Pure Cadence 4.",
120236,4,10/24/2017,"Comfortable & stylish I bought this shoe because my knees & heels hurt a lot during & after I run.  Since I do not run often (once or twice per week), I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This shoe is really comfortable & I love the look (I bought the teal/navy color). However, I have had more pain than usual (not because of the shoe) and I haven't been able to run in my new shoes, but I've been walking, approx 3 miles each day.  When I walk, they are comfortable & do not rub anywhere on my foot or leave blisters.  They are ""low"" in that they will not protect your ankle from an ankle roll, or weak ankles.  So far, I'm happy!",
120236,4,10/24/2017,"Love em!❤️ I have to buy the Pure  Candence 6 and Pure Flow Brooks  a 1/2 size bigger than what I wear. They fit perfectly knowing that. My new Pure Candence 6 are light when jogging. Love the support. Have had so many complements on them. One complement was ""I love how they don't look big and bulky like a lot of tennis shoes look"", which is one of the reasons I love this shoe!!! I tried to buy the black and purple pair but was out of stock😢",
120236,3,10/22/2017,"Sizing is off My last pair of Brooks was a size 9, but with the Cadence 6, my toes fill up the entire toe box. My normal shoe size is 8 1/2 -9, so I'm really surprised that I now have to go up a half size for the first time. I haven't yet run in them, but I can tell that it's going to be a problem, and I don't want to lose another toenail. The shoes don't feel like they would force my toes forward, but it's too close for comfort.",
120236,4,10/20/2017,Good shoes. Very comfy. I really like the feel of these shoes. They aren't heavy and are very comfy.,
120236,3,10/19/2017,"Comfortable but the toe plate broke I run regular half marathons and had a half marathon in October. I had the Pure Cadence, 5 last year which I loved, so I figured I would invest in the Pure Cadence 6. I bought a pair for my marathon. Super comfortable and lightweight. Totally went the distance. However, after 90 miles, the toe plate dented on the right foot between my big and second toe. I returned them and bought another pair (unfortunately the color I liked was sold out in my size). I ran my marathon in the new shoes great - still comfortable and didn't cause much foot pain. However, at the end, the toe plate had dented again. These shoes had even less miles on them. Very disappointing. I didn't have this issue with the 5's until many more miles were put on. I don't know if it's just me, but the 5's were my favorite running shoes so it made me a bit sad.",
120236,4,10/17/2017,"I would buy this product again. I run different distances and also do some cross training. The shoe is very comfortable generally but sometimes after higher mileage my feet hurt. These however fit my feet best. Brooks unfortunately changed this shoe a while back and the store stopped carrying it. I think it was after the 3 (which I loved, attached tongue and all!) I tried the pure flow and they made everything on me hurt and they did not have enough cushion. I will stick with the pure cadence but my feet will be thankful if no major changes are made.",
120236,5,10/10/2017,I have been buying this product again and again! I use this product for interval training on the treadmill and long distance running outside. It fits perfectly and feels great.,
120236,2,10/09/2017,Not the best I'm a nurse and on my feet for the majority of my 12 hr shifts. This particular sneaker pulls in at the tip of the toes (between 2nd & 3rd toes; on both feet) and causes a great deal of discomfort.,
120236,5,10/08/2017,These shoes are awesome! It's my third pair of Brooks. I use them everyday. They are very comfortable. Please offer more styles in predominantly black. Brooks shoes corrected my walking posture. No more lower back ache.,
120236,5,10/06/2017,pure cadence 6 They feel great. I have used only Brooks for ruining/walking (11 marathons when younger)The best support and comfort.,
120236,5,10/01/2017,"Lightweight and supportive I bought these because I was looking for a marathon worthy shoe that was lightweight but supportive for flat feet. They are perfect. They feel as stable as a heavier more traditional supportive shoe, but they are light and nimble. I've done all of my long runs in them and will race a marathon in them next week.",
120236,5,10/01/2017,"Love this running shoe! A great light weight running shoe with a touch of support. I am a petite 5-2, so I always appreciate a light weight shoe. I personally prefer a 4mm drop instead of a 8mm drop. I think the shoes are a tad narrow, but not significant enough to cause me to search for a different shoe. Currently on my third pair of PureCadence shoes and I have been injury free the entire time. And most importantly, I love running in these shoes.",
120236,5,09/24/2017,"Finally! A shoe I love again. I was heartbroken when the Pure Connect retired. I tried the Pure Flow 5 and 6 but was not satisfied with the shoes' tongues. Although I overpronate, the Pure Cadence is getting the job done for the distances I am running (less than 5 miles at a time).  The colors are great, and the weight can't be beat. Thank you, Brooks!",
120236,5,09/23/2017,"comfortable support shoes I've tried support shoes in the past for my flat feet and always found them too uncomfortable to wear but these are so comfortable, I forget they're supportive! They're lightweight but cushiony. I have trouble with shoes that are too heavy and these feel light and springy! Really happy with these so far, although I haven't tried running due to an injury limiting that.",
120236,5,09/21/2017,"Great fit I walk my very energic dogs twice a day for an average of 6 miles, 7 days a week. Just got these a few weeks ago and I like them. Fit is great and they have a nice support. Very light weight. Brooks running shoes have always Come through for me.. I especially like that the sole doesn't wear down as fast as other brands.",
120236,5,09/17/2017,"Love these These don't cause me the usual problems I get with running shoes.  I have trouble with pressure on the top of my foot, numb toes, and slipping heels.  I have plenty of room to wiggle my toes around in these, which I love.  They are lightweight but despite that they still feel very cushioned.  So far, I love wearing these and have no complaints!",
120236,4,09/14/2017,Will givea try with bigger size. ,
120236,2,09/13/2017,"Pure Cadence I like the fact that they are so lightweight,  however they do not have enough cushion",
120236,5,09/13/2017,"Love these shoes! I have been running in newtons for years now, But they recently changed the model I liked. I haven't been able to find another pair that I love, so I figured I'd go back to my brooks roots. I took the quiz that recommends a shoe for you, and these were my best match. I was nervous about trying a different brand after years of the unique newton shoes, and loved these so much that ended up putting 16 miles on them within the first 72 hours! Here are just a few of the features I really love about these shoes:The first thing I noticed when I put these shoes on is how RIDICULOUSLY comfortable they are! They have enough supportive cushioning to absorb the harshness of city running without being heavy and bulky. I have been battling Achilles tendinitis for a while now, and the typical discomfort I feel during my runs just completely subsided after the first mile of running in these. After that point, I just felt like I was floating over the sidewalk. Next, the toe box. I have flat, wide feet, which is always a concern when it comes to running shoes. While the toe box on these is a touch more narrow than I would ideally like, the material is so flexible that I can literally spread my toes out as wide as they will go in these shoes without any pressure. Along the same lines are the laces. They are made out of some type of spandex-y material, allowing them to be very stretchy. I love this simple (yet genius!) feature because it allows the shoe itself to flex and expand with every step, which is incredibly helpful for my collapsing arches. Speaking of arches...the arch support is perfect for my feet. Just enough to feel it, but not enough to cause discomfort. After my third run in these, I could really feel the relief on my lower leg muscles, which really just shows how critical arch support is to proper running form. I could probably name a bunch more things that I love, but I think you get the point! looking forward to my first long run in these!",
120236,5,09/05/2017,"I bought it in a different color. I like this shoe, but wish the bottom heel was a little lower.  Great shoe, but had 2 buy a 1/2 size bigger",
120236,5,09/02/2017,"Great running shoe!! Just finished my first 5k in these shoes, and they are so comfortable, and supportive. Trained  in Nike's, and decided to purchase these for running, and they are incredible!! Will never buy another brand again!! Love, love, Brooks!!",
120236,4,08/29/2017,A few changes--- Transitioning from another brand. Shoes are VERY comfortable but I would alter a few things.  Laces could be a bit longer as could be the tongue. Like I said I have been wearing another brand so that is what I am used to.,
120236,5,08/28/2017,"My new shoe! I have been running in Brooks Pure series since they were introduced. First, I had PureFlows then tried PureConnect and loved them! I've worn them ever since, through training runs and races - 5k to half marathons. I've had Brooks Ghosts, too but my heart and soles belonged to my PureConnects. You can imagine the heartache when they were discontinued. I snapped up 4 pairs in my size. I'm now wearing pair #3 and with a very active fall/winter/spring racing season ahead, I needed to find a replacement for my PureConnects. I went to my local running store and tried PureFlows, Ghosts, and PureCadence. To my surprise, the Cadence was, by far, my favorite. They have the perfect blend of support, cushion, and comfort, while providing real ""road feel"" and are lightweight. I ran a 5k Saturday for my first run wearing them and they passed my benchmark test - I didn't think about them at all while running. I didn't think I'd find a shoe I loved as much as my PureConnects but the PureCadence has stolen my heart & soles!",
120236,4,07/29/2017,"Great support! I've been running with Brooks pureflow shoes for the last few months and find them to be extremely comfortable. However, I developed posterior tibial tendonitis and decided to seek out a more supportive shoe from Brooks, as I figured my flat feet may have been exacerbating the condition. These shoes offer great support, but I'm still in the early stages of testing them out.  I usually run a size 9 in Brooks went half a size up as suggested by previous users. I'm so glad I did! But I might even have to go to a size ten.",
120236,5,07/29/2017,Best Brooks running sneaker ,
120236,5,07/22/2017,great fit ,
120236,5,07/16/2017,"Quality Running Shoe Running shoes are the only shoes I'm willing to fork out a pretty penny for. I decided to buy these after good reviews. I run 5k's and 10k's every week and these are so comfortable and worth the money. I caution though, know your foot type before buying a running shoe; these may not work everyone's running gait.",
120236,5,07/14/2017,Love this shoe I have some foot issues & needed a pair of running shoes with a little more cushion.  The PureCadence 6 has been a great fit for me.  This shoe is true to size and has ample cushion for my longer miles.,
120236,5,07/13/2017,My favorite shoe I love this shoe.  I have naught this shoe several times and it never disappoints me.  This by far my favorite shoe made by Brooks!!!,
120236,5,07/09/2017,Lightweight but supportive I was worried upon first putting them on that my heel was goi g to slip when running but with a lace down technique on the top loop these shoes haven't moved a bit. I was looking for something similar to the pure flow with a little extra cushion and these are it. Still light weight but added cushion and support!  I was able to jump right into these shoes and needed no transition time. Highly recommend them,
120236,4,07/08/2017,"First pair of PureCadence True to size and width. Good for short runs, races and everyday wear. Can never go wrong with a pair of Brooks.",
120236,3,07/02/2017,"Unfortunately, not comfortable I was very much looking forward to these shoes. I love that they are light weight. I think they are very stylish. I got the purplish blue and black. They really look good. I used the size widget and gout the right size,  which is one size bigger than usual since they run small. However, when I ran or walk in these,  the bottoms of my feet hurt pretty badly. It was very consistent. I'm not sure why.",
120236,5,06/30/2017,I love this shoe! This shoe is so amazingly comfortable. It feels like I am running on air. I am in love with this shoe,
120236,5,06/29/2017,Love my PureCadenace 6 Shoes ,
120236,5,06/28/2017,"AMAZING! These shoes are simply fantastic! They are my first pair of Brooks and I think I am hooked for life. I'm an overpronator and suffered from peroneal tendonitis earlier this year, so I am very cautious about my shoes and form and everything else now (never want to feel thag pain again!) I put these on for the first time for a 10 mi long run and I experience ZERO issues. These shoes are light and minimalist for being a support shoe and I love it! I don't feel like I'm subject to super thick and clunky shoes for my overpronation now :). I am normally a size 7.5 and ordered these in a size 8 and they fit perfectly. Thanks Brooks for making my marathon training that much better!!",
120236,5,06/26/2017,"Incredible lightweight comfort I have had feet and knee joint issues over the past ten years and am limited in what shoes I can wear, with most running shoes being of a clunky nature. These shoes are as light and comfortable as could be and give good support. I will probably make them my daily shoes. That said, because of the build I recommend them for road  running but not trail running or anything with rougher terrain.",
120236,4,06/23/2017,"Great product but one small issue Love the shoes; actually one of the best shoes I have on my feet. The style is great and low profile. However, I was surprised to see the very middle of the toe area to cave in. Nothing has fallen on the shoe and it one day caved in. It's tolerable but I do feel it pressing on my toe when I walk. I'm in my shoes all day (hospital employee).",
120236,5,06/20/2017,Soft and light.... very different from what I was used to ,
120236,2,06/16/2017,"Disappointed and returned 😭 Bought with hopes of replacing my old favorites,  was greatly disappointed.  Heel and foot pain from lack of support and cushioning.  Knee pain kept me awake at nite.  Also both pair had pin size holes in the soles that squeaked when filled with moisture from running. Very annoying. Hopefully an isolated incident.",
120236,5,06/14/2017,"Perfect running shoe I am a collegiate cross country runner. They are everything I expected and more. I tried them on in a store before ordering the color I wanted online. While they are a very light weight shoe, you can istantly feel the comfortable cushioning the moment you try them on. To give you some background info, I had ankle surgery approximately 6 years ago and these shoes work great for me. I also read in some of the other reviews that these shoes can be slippery when planking or doing other floor exercises at the gym---this is true. However, that is the only flaw I have noticed so far. I've had them for around 3 weeks now!",
120236,5,06/11/2017,"PureCadence is Back! I found PureCadence with their 3rd model and loved it. The 4th was bad leaving my feet feeling tired and arches hurting, also the tongue moved all over the place with running. The fifth was losing its Pure minimalist feel. Now with the 6th, it's back to the shoe I loved. I think it's actually better with softer and more breathable material yet the support is back to the system I liked in the 3. This may lead to faster wearing out but that's what you ask for with a more minimalist shoe. Brooks, don't lose my shoe again!",
120236,4,06/08/2017,The Return of PureCadence Thank you for returning to the PureCadence design. PC5s were like a totally different shoe. The PC6 feels much more like the 3 and 4 design.,
120236,5,06/08/2017,I love these shoes. I use these shoes for any long walks & running. My feet feel great during and after my walks or runs. I can't wait to slip them on and go after I get home.,
120236,3,05/26/2017,"new to me fabric on the top of the shoe creased after about 10 wears on the treadmill, so with every step I could feel that on my toe which made the shoe uncomfortable.  I tried adjusting the lacing and the tongue but nothing helped.  Other than that it was a very comfortable shoe.",
120236,5,05/22/2017,"THRILLED After a very disappointing PureCadence 5 experience I was apprehensive to buy the PureCadence 6. I had loved all the generations before the PureCadence 5 so I decided to give them one more chance and I am thrilled I did! They are just like the earlier editions with how comfortable and flexible they are and as a nurse that's on my feet for 12 hours at a time they are a lifesaver. Great for working out, long runs and long shifts at the hospital.",
120236,5,05/14/2017,"Great Shoes I'm so glad that the pure cadence have gone back to what they were for the first few generations! Great fit, no rubbing tongue-they are an overall great endurance shoe. I can typically get between 400 and 500 miles out of them, which is also terrific for a lightweight shoe!",
120236,4,04/25/2017,"Running great- overall shape odd for cross training Great for running. Not so great for cross-training or classes at the gym. Really poor traction on the toe part when doing planks or mountain climbers. I've slipped more in these shoes than any running shoes I've ever owned (thankfully not outside!). Also, the top material is cool, but it buckles between the big and second toe.... very odd.",
120236,5,04/22/2017,Perfect Great for my group exercise class (Body Attack.) Very hard to find good shoes for that class.,
120236,4,04/20/2017,"Love everything. Except for one thing. When Brooks discontinued the Pure Connect, I cast about for a new running shoe. I tried the Pure Flow but returned them because the tongue of the shoe cut into the fronts of my ankles. It used to be a rounded edge but now it has a sharp edge and it brushes up against the area where top of foot turns to front of ankle. Even if I wear taller socks, I still end up with chafing that turns to open wound on longer runs. Needless to say, I returned the Pure Flows and tried other shoes (not-Brooks) to find an ideal running show. I never found a pair I liked as much as my Pure Connects. So I returned to Brooks and tried the Pure Cadence. I love everything about them EXCEPT that the tongue construction. Once again, that rougher edge means cuts on the fronts of my ankles. Since I like everything else about the show, I have figured out a workaround to be able to wear them without slicing up my ankles. But I really wish Brooks would go back to the tongues with the rounded finish on the tongues.",
120236,5,04/20/2017,Love the comfort of this shoe I love the comfort and look of this shoe. Make all your shoes as comfy as this one and I would buy them all. They are perfect for every day wear not crazy colors that go with nothing these shoes go with a lot of what I have.,
120236,5,04/19/2017,"Pure Cadence - The Best Support Sneaker For Me! I love the Pure Cadence sneaker!  I have owned all models except PC 5 due to the reviews.  My favorite is the original. Loved the toe box in that shoe as it fit like a glove and being a minimalist shoe I felt I could walk faster in the shoe without the occurrence of pain in my knees and ankles.  The PC 6 is a nice shoe being comfortable and light weight with good arch support but I feel like the toe box is a bit large for my foot.  I prefer the contoured feel of the PC 1.  In addition, I feel there was a slight downgrade in the amount of cushioning from previous models but still a good shoe.  Brooks please never discontinue this shoe. It's the best support sneaker out there to help with pronation control. Thank you for providing a great shoe!",
120236,5,04/19/2017,"Very happy The shoe is everything I was looking for. Lightweight and fast but still sufficiently supportive. It was a terrible idea, but they are so comfortable out of the box that I ran 22 miles in them the second day I had them and didn't have any issues with blisters or discomfort. Brooks: Yes, I am a woman, but I'd still strongly prefer a color choice other than pink or purple.",
120236,5,04/18/2017,"Perfect for a Forefoot Striking, Supinator For so long I've gone from shoe to shoe trying to find the right fit for me.  I'm a forefoot striking supinator.  It's been so frustrating.  In the past, I struggled to find a shoe that was durable enough to run on my toes while also guiding my feet into a better pronation.  As I run on the outsides of my feet (I have low arches), my ankles can get sore from a structureless shoe.  But too much structure hurts my toes and the tendons on the top of my feet.Finally, I've found the right shoe.  These are a perfect balance.  They're lightweight and durable but also provide support.  I will be buying at least two more pairs before they get updated.  Thanks, Brooks.  You nailed it.",

120236,5,04/11/2017,Perfect for my flat footed daughter My daughter has a hard time finding shoes that feel good to wear with her being flat footed. She's worn Brooks for years now but they have seemed bulky. She likes how lightweight these feel,
120236,2,04/10/2017,"I still love Brooks shoes just not these! Ive been buying brooks shoes for years now and have always had great luck with the pure flow and pure cadence shoes. However, as soon as I put these on I immediately realized how stiff and hard the back of the heal was on this shoe. I wear a narrow size 8 and these shoes squeezed me so much I had to almost completely unlace them to walk. No cushion towards the back of the shoe. Returning and exchanging for the glycerin 14. Its a more expensive shoe, but being a nurse on my feet 12 hrs a day, I feel that its worth it. I still love Brooks shoes, just not these!",
120236,4,04/07/2017,Lightweight & Comfortable ,
120236,4,04/07/2017,"I'll stick with Brooks! The cushion and support are great. Very light weight and easy to pack into a suitcase. The only problem is the narrow toe box. Or my foot is getting wider. I usually get a full size bigger and that is fine. I did the same this time, but the toe box is still narrow. I recommend a wide width.",
120236,4,04/05/2017,"Getting closer to the old product I loved I still prefer your older versions of this, but this is getting closer to what I was used to. I still don't know why you changed such a great product.",
120236,5,04/03/2017,Great walking shoe Been searching for a good walking shoe and this brand was recommended to me. So glad I went with this choice. Just went on my first walk and I felt like I could walk many more miles if it hadn't of got dark on me lol. I have a plate and screws in one of my feet and these shoes don't bother that area at all. They have great arch support and cushions impact great.,
120236,5,03/31/2017,"Glad to have my Fav shoe back! LOVE these shoes, I am an avid Cadence fan and I bought another pair when the 5s came and was crushed. I couldn't run in them and sent them back.  Brooks really listened to the complaints on the 5 and I have my favorite shoe back.  Still not as good as earlier models but this one I can work with!",
120236,5,03/27/2017,"Stable, comfortable shoe This is my second pair of Pure Cadence running shoes.  I bought the original version and wore them out adventure racing and trail running.  i was not impressed with the 5 when I went to purchase a new pair, and went with Asics instead.  The 6 is a definite improvement over the last model.  This is a great stable shoe on and off the road; I don't feel like I am going to twist an ankle if I misstep on the trail.  I am also prone to shin splints, but I do not get them in these shoes.",
120236,5,03/20/2017,Favorite Pair of Brooks! I bought these and immediately fell in love with them. Needed something lightweight but supportive and that's exactly what I got!,
120236,5,03/15/2017,!!!!Amazing!!! I have high arches and wide feet. This (purecadence 6 with 3D) is the only shoe that I have ever found that makes running comfortable. I used to believe that I didn't like running because it hurt my feet. I put this shoe on and was able to finish a 5 mile run (my first ever) in my first week without any negative repercussions to my feet. I have never been so excited about a pair of tennis shoes in my life!For those of you that feel the shoe is too roomy in the middle or too wide in the toe box I'm here to tell you that some of us need the space 😬- So thanks brooks! I'm ordering my second pair this week. I just wish you had more colors so you could take more of my $$$.,
120236,5,03/10/2017,"Awesome shoe! I love this shoe! This is my 5th pair of Pure Cadence and they just keep getting better every year. Light weight, good response. I have run so many half marathons and one full with these shoes I love them.",
120236,2,03/06/2017,"more changes I love the look, and putting them on and walking was fine.  But when I started running, I had to stop and switch shoes in the first half mile.  There's a lot of padding in the heel, and then nothing to balance it in the front.  They feel so much bulkier than previous version, closer to a traditional shoe than a minimalist inspired. I was pretty disappointed",
120236,5,03/04/2017,"Comfortable, and roomy. Training for a marathon. I find them to be comfortable and roomy in particular on long runs. No problem with the tongue as on Pure Cadence 5. Love them.",
120236,5,03/03/2017,"Love!!!! Very comfortable. Nice, roomy toe box. Laces stay tied and have some stretch.",
120236,4,03/03/2017,"Not as good as the 4, better than the 5 I use this for a 7-8 mile run.  I do not feel the shoe is tight enough across the middle of the shoe.  And I have an average foot.  The toe box is too wide and I look like I have a ducks foot.  However, the tongue is much improved from the 5- which gave me blisters.  Overall, some of the changes from the 5 are better, some are not.  Since I can wear them without blisters, overall it is better, but my favorite version is the 4.",
120236,5,02/21/2017,"PureCadence 6, found the shoe!!!! Great shoes! I have tried many pairs of shoes all with heel slippage, with the Pure Cadence 6 I have had no problem! They have also been great on my bad knees also.",
120237,5,12/27/2017,Amazing shoe that is great for sprinters I bought this shoe at the beginning of my track season and it carried me through practices and workouts all the way to states. They are comfortable and light but still provide a very good support. I run hurdles and I need a shoe that will be light but still durable enough to dampen shocks from when my feet hit the floor and this shoe has never failed me.,
120237,5,12/23/2017,I have bought this shoe many times and will continue ,
120237,3,12/22/2017,"My pureflow experience I like the shoes, but not for marathon training, which is what I'd purchased them for. I have kept them and use them during my cross training days.",
120237,4,12/20/2017,"Good comfort Nice, light weight shoe. I have always been an avid pure connect shoe fan, but since that was discontinued I decided to give the new pure flow a shot. Good shoe to run in, it just needs more arch support like the previous connect shoes offered. Other than the lesser arch support, this is a great shoe.",
120237,2,12/16/2017,"Loved my Pureflows before but this shoe hurts a bit Loved my older version of Pureflows but could not find them at a shoe store.  I bought online the same size 9 as the old shoes, but this shoe seems a bit too small and tight, although all of my other shoes are size 9.",
120237,5,12/16/2017,"Just what I wanted These are the only shoes I run in. I like the PureFlow 6 better than the PureFlow 5 because the tongue is a little more flexible and less stiff than the 5.  Light weight and adequately cushioned. Not too supportive and allows for a natural foot strike, which I like, rather than shoes with a huge heel counter that force a heel strike.",
120237,5,12/09/2017,"Really love these shoes. Super light n snug It's taken me a long time to find a running shoe that works with my narrow, high arch feet. This is the one. So happy to have purchased these.",
120237,5,12/08/2017,I LOVE the PureFlow 6 I was a little hesitant buying a newer model of pureflow (6) but love more than the original pureflow. My feet and arches don't hurt after longer runs!,
120237,4,12/07/2017,"Great for OCRs I train at an gym that specializes in OCR training and these shoes are great for training on the obstacles - traverse walls, cargo nets, etc.  They're very light-weight and feel good on my feet.",
120237,5,12/03/2017,I keep buying Brooks Pure Flow- my favorite sneakers ever! ,
120237,5,12/03/2017,"awesome shoe! I just bought my 3rd pair. Thankfully, this model works for me. I went through many pairs of the pure flow 4 but didn't try the 5s based on the reviews.This shoe is great. the only issue with them is that they collect a TON of rocks. Otherwise, they feel more cushy than the 4s. The width is great. I feel like my feet have plenty of room to spread out and run naturally. These shoes have really helped me work on my running form and run strong.",
120237,5,11/30/2017,"My new go to These are my new go to shoe for short runs up to 13.1 miles.  I started in Launches so here is my quick comparison: The launch's heel was too high for me-these ""connect"" you more to your run w/o losing support.  These also have more room in the toe box than the Launch which helps for those longer runs and overall happiness (less cramping too!).  These are very light weight.  I was initially worried about trying a shoe in the ""connect"" family  b/c of the use of the word, minimalist but the transition from an energize shoe to a connect shoe is not as drastic as you think.  I tried on the pure cadence but did not buy b/c these have more arch support so I found them more comfortable. People always say to wear in your shoes before race day but I can happily report that my new pureflow 6's did great on my Thanksgiving day half, but I also was already running in another pair of pureflow 6's so I knew they'd be a good fit for me. Love these! Have bought twice and will buy again!",
120237,5,11/27/2017,Only company that makes a shoe to fit my size ,
120237,5,11/21/2017,"Great lightweight shoe These shoes are somehow both well-cushioned and extremely lightweight. I've been wearing the PureFlow for years and this version is the best yet. I wear a half-size larger in Brooks than I do in other shoes, so yes it runs big but knowing this, the 9.5 I ordered fits perfectly.",
120237,5,11/20/2017,"I've gone thru 3 pairs, love these shoes so much I've gotten many compliments on these shoes, so they're great for sneakers to knock around in after retiring.Because they're lightweight, their pavement life is pretty short if you run lots of mileage They fit like a glove though, and give you enough support without weighing you down. A little snug in the upper, but that makes them feel like a second skin.I'll keep getting these until they upgrade. Hopefully they'll keep a few of my favorite features: colors, supports, lightness, flexibility, shoelaces perfect length (not dragging and not too short to double-knot)",
120237,5,11/14/2017,Awesome as always ,
120237,5,11/13/2017,LOVE them great running shoe! ,
120237,5,11/12/2017,Absolutely love them. ,
120237,5,11/10/2017,Love these!!!! The toe room is awesome. I have run for 40 years and still love  when I find a favorite shoe. I went a half size up because of reviews but I think I would have been ok with true size.. Using  mostly on dirt trails so like the lighter cushioning.,
120237,3,11/05/2017,"Bring back pure flow 1&2 Let me start with saying you had it right the first time with the Pureflow 1 and 2s.  I am down to my last pair of Pureflow 2s and there is nothing like them.  I bought a total of about 10 pairs of the 2s- many after reading the abysmal reviews of the 3s and use them for workouts or races where performance matters.  They are light, comfortable, supportive, have the perfect drop and are the perfect blend of plush, firm and springy.  The upturned toe really encourages an efficient and fast stride.  The slight flare on the sole is great for supinators like me. I always perform well when wearing them- noticeably different from any other shoe I have tried (and I have had to try a lot since the shoe was changed). They even feel fast just standing in them- the feel of a negative drop although I believe the drop is 4 mm. I gave up on them after the bad reviews of the 3s, 4s and 5s but decided to try the 6s again after reading good reviews on the 6s. I would describe the Pureflow 6s as so so.  They look great, are not uncomfortable, are light.  I have no problem with the upper but the lower portion of the shoe lacks the really special feel of the 1s and 2s. They are firm but with less of the springiness and slightly plush (soft) inner feel.  The shape is flatter and not as fast.  All in all they are not the shoe they once were- the kind of shoe that felt so good it made me want to get out and run.  I know a lot of people liked them too- please consider returning to the previous construction of the lower portion of the shoe.",
120237,5,11/03/2017,Just like the last four pairs I've had ,
120237,5,11/03/2017,"Loving the PureFlow 6! I was hoping this shoe had a wide option, but other than that it's a great shoe! Very comfortable!",
120237,5,10/31/2017,"These shoes disappear I alternate these shoes with my Glycerine. The shoes are fine when I put them on, but they almost ""disappear"" when I'm running. It's awesome! The shoes do what they are meant to do: provide support and stability without demanding any attention. I almost forget they are there. Love them!!!",
120237,5,10/31/2017,"My fourth pair and I'll keep buying them I walk about 3 mi several days a week, and with every pair I've bought I've never gotten a blister or felt them to be uncomfortable, even on the break-in walk. I changed to a different model and didn't like them as much so came back to Pure Flow. It looks like they put better tread on them (the reason I had switched), so I like them even better now.",
120237,4,10/30/2017,I would buy this product again I love the low profile and general comfort on my foot.  I did have to switch to thinner socks to accommodate the slightly more snug fit.,
120237,5,10/29/2017,"Light weight and comfortable! These shoes are super low guy weight, not bulky. They are fitted through out the sides but then are roomy for your toes. Love them!",
120237,5,10/27/2017,"This is my go-to street running shoe I run to and from work in these. Every time I get a new pair, it takes about a week to break them in. Overall, good fit for my feet. Not clonky or heavy, but also not too thin.",
120237,4,10/26/2017,Love the PureFlow 6 I was just introduced to this style this summer and fell in love.  The only thing that I'd like added would be a little arch support.  This is my second pair.#reviewsweeps,
120237,4,10/26/2017,Love the PureFlow 6 I was just introduced to these this summer and this is my second pair...love them.  The only thing that might be nice would be a little arch support.,
120237,5,10/24/2017,"#ReviewSweeps #ReviewSweeps.  I will buy nothing but the Brooks shoes for my son.  He is a Freshman in high school.  He has been running since the 5th grade.  He swears by the Pure Flow shoes.  His high school team he runs for is on track to win the State Title in Michigan for Division 3.  We've tried other brands and also other makes.  He also has the Launch shoes, but we had to buy the Pure Flow 6 as he swears by them being the best.  Lets go Caro Tigers, bring home the Title.  #ReviewSweeps",
120237,5,10/24/2017,"Road runner I was putting some serious miles on shoes which were not Brooks. I had massive foot pain and added knee and joint pain. The literal day I switched to Brooks, my pain reduced drastically. My feet are comfortable and the fit was just right. I'd recommend to any road runner. #ReviewSweeps",
120237,5,10/23/2017,Great running shoes! Great shoes.  Pureflow was recommended on Brooks' quiz to help select shoes.  I had run in different Brooks previously but glad I went with the recommendation.  These are very comfortable.  I've ran in them 6 times so far and no issues.,
120237,5,10/23/2017,Favorite running shoe Used this shoe in two marathons and couldn't imagine running in any other shoe.,
120237,4,10/22/2017,"I love it but my favorite is still the PureFlow 4 I run mainly road in this shoe between 8-20 miles at a time and it feels nicely light and is a great minimalist shoe where there are so few these days, yet it's doesn't feel minimalist as it moves and flexes with your foot and lets you hug the road",
120237,5,10/22/2017,"My most comfortable sneakers ever!! I'm not a runner but a mother of seven children plus a full time nurse, so I'm on my feet all day!! I live outside the U.S. but have bought these shoes several times even though it means that it's more complicated for me to get them. They are super light, supportive and comfortable. I also like that they have a more narrow look and aren't big and ""klunky"". I wear them an entire day and my feet don't get ""tired"".I highly recommend them to my family, friends and co-workers.",
120237,4,10/20/2017,"Light and natural glide I've ran in my new pair of Brooks' PureFlow 6 several times and find them to be comfortable and incredibly light. The shoes are well suited to city running, especially since the sole has spaces where dirt and rocks could get stuck. These shoes are great for speed workouts as well as every day training. They're breathable and hug the foot, assisting my runs in feeling smooth and easy breezy. I've been running in Brooks for years and this is my second pair of PureFlow.",
120237,4,10/19/2017,Great of running shoe ,
120237,5,10/18/2017,"Would definitely recommend After running in Nike frees for several years and a constant struggle with knee pain, I decided to buy some quality running shoes. I usually run 5-6 mile trails around 4-5 times a week and these shoes have been tremendous in giving me support and comfort.",
120237,5,10/18/2017,BEST SHOES EVER I typically run around 3 times a week in my neighborhood. I love the comfort of this shoe and how it feels like I glide when running. My only dislike is that I wish I had tried on a 1/2 size smaller to compare and see which fit was best. It feels a little big to me.,
120237,5,10/18/2017,I love these shoes! These are my go-to running shoes and the ones I trust most for marathon training.  I've had them in the past and love them then. I tried to venture out to other brands and other shoes to see what else was out there but never found something I loved as much as these.  These are my absolute favorite running shoes.  They are comfortable but not too soft and provide both cushion and support but not overly so. I could not recommend them more highly.   #ReviewSweeps,
120237,5,10/18/2017,Always come back to these ,
120237,5,10/17/2017,"Love these! Absolutely love these shoes! Went for a 4 mile run the day I got them, and didn't need to break them in at all. Definitely glad I read reviews and bought a half size up.",
120237,5,10/16/2017,Comfy from toe to heel! These shoes are similar to the Pure Flow 4's. I would highly recommend for those with a neutral shoe,
120237,4,10/13/2017,Light weight. Good cushion. I miss the pure connect but this is the closest thing I have found to it. Great cushion. Very light. I supinate and have arthritis in both knees and my R foot. I wear these to work (hospital) and at the gym.,
120237,5,10/13/2017,"Most comfortable shoe EVER!!! These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned besides flip flops. Yes, I am a girl who wears flip flops everyday, everywhere. I have always hated the way shoes made my feet feel. Even so much that I would barefoot run on the beach because I honestly hated shoes. I started having a lot of knee pain though so decided to try a pair of shoes that were not minimal. My knees have stopped hurting, I feel supported but also don't feel like I am wearing a bulky, heavy shoe. They are very easy to run in and I don't feel like I am struggling to keep good form like I do with heavy, bulky shoes! Great shoe, highly recommend!",
120237,5,10/12/2017,"Great Trainers I'm a forefoot striker and I love these shoes.  Just the right amount of forefoot cushioning, easy to lace and no side blow outs (yet).  My feet are very happy!",
120237,5,10/12/2017,Second pair this year! Love the lightweight design of this shoe. I've had several pair of Pure Flow over the years and I recommend them to everyone! #ReviewSweeps,
120237,5,10/12/2017,"Love them I don't run along distance, but these are great for a 5k and regular running.",
120237,5,10/12/2017,My new go to shoe I'm on my feet for 12 hours a day and purchased these shoes for work. Best support and comfort ever!,
120237,4,10/10/2017,"True to Description This shoe works perfectly as a neutral, simple shoe. Provides just enough support for comfort, but does not feel bulky or inhibiting in controlling foot fall. #ReviewSweeps",
120237,5,10/10/2017,Absolutely LOVE! ,
120237,5,10/09/2017,"Must have my brooks while traveling! Can walk all day on stone or concrete in the city such as NYC or Florence with complete comfort. Can move agilely on a trail be it on the root-laden and hard-rock of Maine or the softer ground of San Diego. These shoes have enough cushion in the sole and are supportive and do not slip, yet do not sacrifice lightness and sleekness which imparts agility. I also like the flexible upper. There was no break-in time necessary. Been buying these for years and love them for everyday use home or away from home!",
120237,5,10/05/2017,"My favorite shoe yet This is my third pair of brooks running shoes, but my first pair of the pure flows. After having these shoes for about I month I can honestly say that these are the best shoes that I have had for running. I have long narrow feet with high arches and I feel so supported the whole time I'm wearing them. I'm also someone that trips on their shoes a lot because I don't pick up my feet high enough and I have had no issue with these because they are super lightweight and not bulky whatsoever.",
120237,1,10/03/2017,Running with rocks in your shoe!! Love the look and feel of the PureFlow 6 -- purchased them earlier this year. But I run on gravel a lot and the rocks actually get stuck in the bottom of this shoe -- in the crevasses. The rocks have actually went all the way through and punched holes in the bottom of the sole. Wish these shoes had held up longer.,
120237,1,09/29/2017,"Not for thin sole feet For people with thin feet and a big big toe. I had to get a size bigger cause the shoe smashed my toe. Then I lost the support I needed. Oh my I wore these shoes for 20 minutes and excursiating pain began. I let the salesman talk me into buying them. I was so thankful he let me take them back. I was ready to beg,the pain was so great and these are not cheap shoes.",
120237,2,09/29/2017,Older model was better I have long narrow toes and I found the older model of this shoe to be the best sneakers I've ever worn. They hugged my foot comfortably and I felt very stable wearing them. The toe box is bulkier in the new version and my toes swim side to side and up and down in them. I prefer the tighter fit in the toe area.,
120237,3,09/29/2017,"Mostly love Took the recommendation to size up half a size. Feels a little big but not so big that my regular size would right. I love the PureFlows but the changes to the 5s and 6s haven't been for the better. The 6 is definitely an improvement over the 5, though. Overall cushioning and comfort is there but something just feels ""off.""",
120237,5,09/25/2017,Most definitely!!! I walk 31/2 - 5 miles five times a week and these shoes are perfect for that.,
120237,4,09/18/2017,"Great light running sneakers Nice light weight running sneaker.  These run a bit small, but if you order a half size up they are great.",
120237,5,09/16/2017,"The perfect lightweight road shoe I use this as my road running show, usually 3-6 miles. I have been wearing them for three weeks now, and they feel great. I like the level of cushion and the fact that they are close to neutral with the 4mm drop. The only thing that could be improved would be reducing the size of the gaps in the bottom since rocks tend to get stuck. Otherwise, they're great! They seem sturdier in the upper mesh than the Saucony Kinvara's that I used to run in and would wear out in the upper by creating crease tears by the tie flex zone.",
120237,5,09/15/2017,"The PureFlow is back! I have been running in Brooks for a while now and my favorite shoes were the PureFlow 2 (that was the current model when I discovered them).  I tried the PureFlow 4 and 5 and they weren't quite right.  The PureFlow 6 is as close to the 2 as I have found.  This is my third pair of them and I love them.  I wear them on runs ranging from 3-14 miles and have had no issues with comfort.  For speed work I wear the Hyperion.  If you like a lot of shoe these are not for you, but if you want something lightweight but more than a racing flat, I would highly recommend them.",
120237,5,09/15/2017,"Just what I wanted I used the Shoe Finder to see what Brooks recommended. I was surprised when it wasn't my usual Ravenna.  As a 60+ lady that has had foot surgery, these shoes are amazing.  There are NO embellishments on the side to rub on my scar & hardware.  They definitely have a different feel from my Ravennas, so I decided to do a test walk with them (I walk a 16 minute mile.)  They felt so good I ended up going 5 miles.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",
120237,5,09/14/2017,Still loving the pure flow This is my favorite running shoe (I've run in multiple models). My local running store stopped carrying them so I tried a different shoe from Brooke's pure line and they just were not the same. Ordering off line and shipping was quick and easy.,
120237,4,09/12/2017,These were for my wife.  Finds them light and responsive ,
120237,3,09/12/2017,"Not for me I wore these all of 2 times, my shins and feet ached after wearing. I used the Brooks quiz to choose them and hoped I would like them as much as my old Brooks pure connect, sadly no.",
120237,5,09/12/2017,Love the new PureFlow 6 I train for Ironman Triathlons and use these shoes for my shorter runs (under 10 miles) - love them! I stopped wearing the PureFlow when they changed to the 5's...hated them! The new 6 has the right amount of cushion and the tongue is soft again! I always go up a half size and they're perfect.,
120237,5,09/08/2017,"Very comfy with just enough support - attractive, too! Bought these to replace a worn-out pair of shoes I use in my trainer's gym.  Wanted a neutral shoe that was lightly supportive, and these are perfect.  Just a tiny bit shorter than a traditional 9.",
120237,5,09/08/2017,Love this shoe I run about 15 miles a week as I am building my mileage back up!  These are great treadmill or street shoes!,
120237,3,09/08/2017,"Good shoes but the inconsistent sizing among 6 series itself I bought the very same model in different color couple of months ago. The fit and the comfort of that pair was perfect. I have recently buy another pair in different color but this one feels smaller and narrower. Sizing should not differ across the same models but this has been the case for my two pairs of Pureflow 6. Then, there is no point in online shopping for international customers (I am living abroad and most of the time, I cannot return the items due to customs and shipping costs).",
120237,5,09/06/2017,"Looks Great, Feels Great! I used the online tool to see what shoe I should get and this has worked perfectly for me. My ankles usually roll in a bit and these are super supportive. They also look great. Love it.",
120237,3,09/06/2017,Pureflow 6 I love Brooks and wanted to try the Pure Flow. I ran in them for a total of about 25 miles and did not like them. I felt too much of the pavement and I just needed a little more support. Will try Ghost again.,
120237,5,09/05/2017,Nice shoes I use the shoes for my weekend wear; walking. Etc. They are very comfortable,
120237,4,09/05/2017,"Great casual shoe. VERY LIGHT and comfortable.  I wore these to work on casual day and they were great!  They made it through the ""all day test"".  I have not worn the shoe to run in.  They are a little wide in the toe but only aesthetically.  The colors are great!",
120237,5,09/02/2017,"Love these shoes I don't run but walk several miles per day. These shoes fit my narrow,  arthritic feel extremely well. They are comfortable and I do not get blisters on my little toes which is what I experienced with another brand of sneakers when I walked a lot. Would highly recommend them to anyone who might need a great, comfortable sneaker to get them thru their day.",
120237,5,09/02/2017,"Starting to run again... As a plus size runner it's hard to find a shoe that allows me to feel confident that my legs and feet are fully supported when I run. The pureflow 6 does just that. They are lightweight but have great arch support and are fun to look at, too.",
120237,5,08/31/2017,"Very comfortable and lightweight I wear these shoes for running, elliptical, and sometimes weight-lifting and they are always comfortable and feel light on the feet.",
120237,5,08/30/2017,"My favorite running shoe! I love this show for running on the road and even walking around for errands! Once I broke them in after a few runs, they have become my favorite running shoe of all time. They are so comfy and easy to develop a running rhythm with.",
120237,5,08/30/2017,"Excellent Running Shoe! I love these shoes for running on the road. I can easily get into a rhythm with them, and once I broke them in with a few runs they have been the best shoe I've ever ran with!",
120237,5,08/27/2017,"Great walking shoe I speed walk 3-5 miles a day.  These shoes are perfect-/ no break-in period, very comfortable, and eliminated ankle and knee issues.",
120237,5,08/25/2017,YES. FINALLY.  I was a devout PureConnect wearer so when that got discontinued I was heart broken. I used to love the PureFlows but I tried the 5's and they were a disaster.  The 6's are AMAZING. Brooks went back to the earlier models with this design. These shoes are heaven and I never want to take them off!  I wear them for my tempo runs and my long runs and I could not be happier!,
120237,5,08/25/2017,Love these shoes! I love these shoes! They are somewhat wide for just that standard width. They're very comfortable.,
120237,5,08/24/2017,Love! I love these shoes! As someone who suffers from plantar fasciitis I finally found the shoes I need!,
120237,5,08/23/2017,"LOVE! I love these shoes! I am so picky when it comes to shoes and how my body feels when I change shoes that I try a lot of them.  I had originally tried a pair of more expensive Nike shoes and was very disappointed.  I just happened upon Brooks due to seeing that a few friends liked them on Facebook, I had not even heard of them before.  And with a 90 day return policy I could not pass it up.  I am so happy with these shoes!  Comfort and style.  I run outside as well as indoor on a treadmill and a variety of other workouts.  And these shoes are perfect for everything.  I love the curved shape of them and the rounded edges as well, makes for a easy swift run and comfort as well. I also suffer with some foot pain and I have not experienced it with these shoes.  I highly recommend them!  I also get compliments on them often.  Thank you Brooks!",
120237,5,08/22/2017,"I love these! Very versatile shoe. I wear them for crossfit and low mileage runs. On my second pair, and buying the men's version for my son. Lightweight yet stable.",
120237,3,08/19/2017,"Not the PureFlow 2-4, but better than the 5 The PureFlow 2-4 saved my feet. The 6 is an improvement from the 5 that I could not wear. The tongue in the 6 is cutting into the front of my ankle, please change the tongue back to the version 4 and below. I also felt I had more support in the midsole/arch in the previous mentioned versions because of the the strap, which the 6 no longer has.",
120237,5,08/11/2017,"Will only wear Brooks! They really did fix the tongue compared to the last version A which was everyone's pet peeve! There is never a break-in period with Brooks, which is obviously amazing. My first run with these was a 7 miler - no issues whatsoever.Plus, Brooks are vegan - which is part of why I've been wearing them for so long!",
120237,5,08/06/2017,Will not trade it for any other shoes! I love this shoes from day one I had it...it's my 2nd shoes of the same brand and style...been a Brooks fun since I started running 5 yrs ago..,
120237,5,08/06/2017,Great Shoe I love these so much I'm thinking about getting a second pair just for casual wear!,
120237,5,08/05/2017,Ahhh-some! Huge improvement over the last model.  These are so much more comfortable and the woven upper is fantastic.  Very stylish too!,
120237,5,08/05/2017,Great shoe.  Had to exchange for 1/2 size larger. Great for walking and silver sneakers classes. Still waiting for refund on exchange that I sent back 18 days ago.,
120237,5,07/25/2017,"I would buy this product again! This shoe feels like the original Pure Flow! Finally!  I ordered a half size larger than my normal shoe size, but I do this with all of my running shoes and they fit perfectly.   I wear a size 7 in all other shoes, but I always order 7 1/2 in running shoes.  At first when I tried them on they felt like they were going to be too small, like they were cramming my big toe, but I took them for a run and they were great! My toe never felt cramped and I think these stretch out just a little as you wear them.  Very light and responsive.",
120237,5,07/25/2017,LOVE! I haven't bought a pureflow shoe in a couple of years because my last pair had zero padding in the Achilles area and just were not as smooth a ride as previous models. The 6 is excellent!  They're very stable and comfy.  Only con: The soles have very deep ridges and you have to dig rocks out from time to time.,
120237,4,07/24/2017,"No PureFlow 4, But still a good shoe. I love the Pure line... the PureFlow 4 has been my favorite thus far, but this is a close second. I got the grey color scheme which I like a lot... very subtle and also unique. They're fairly stiff though, and they don't seem to be breaking in much with wear (I've had them for 3+ months now). They ware quickly too. So if you're planning to run rough trails, this is maybe not the show for you. The cushion is great and they're really responsive. I'd recommend these to any mid or forefoot runners.",
120237,4,07/20/2017,"Good shoe! I was excited to try the Pureflow again. I used to love the Pureflow 2, they were my favorite shoe ever! Tried the 5, and they were terrible. Bought these a 1/2 size big, it wasn't necessary, but I kept them. They are a comfy running shoe. They still don't have my heart the way the 2s did, but they are definitely an upgrade from the last couple styles. These keep me running because my shin splints don't affect me with this neutral shoe. Keep working on them Brooks, maybe the Pureflows will be amazing again soon!",
120237,5,07/19/2017,"Am I flying or running? I got these shoes in bright colors so I'd feel motivated to get back into running, and I will say with confidence they are the most comfortable running shoe I've ever worn. They're very light weight (I thought the box was empty when they arrived in the mail!), yet they support my feet very well on every step. I can't wait to go for my daily run now in my super-comfy, super-supportive, super-bright-colored shoes!",
120237,5,07/19/2017,LOVE the Pure flow 6!! Love my pureflow 6!! I had PF 4 and loved them but read all the bad reviews for the PF 5 so I waited until 6 came out and it was well worth the wait...very comfortable with great arch support. Dont change them again!!!,
120237,5,07/18/2017,"Comfortable and good for long days on your feet I have always pulled on my Adrenalines to go for a run but recently used the Brooks website to get help with shoe selection. This shoe was the recommendation so I have it a try. I have not yet worn it on a long run but it works well for short distances. I liked it so much that I started wearing them to work, where I am on my feet all day. I am noticing less leg fatigue at the end of the day. Now I just need to order a second pair - one for work and one for running.",
120237,5,07/14/2017,"PureFlow 6 I love, love, LOVE this shoe. I have 2 pairs of the PureFlow 6 that I use for everyday wear and I plan on buying them in more colors soon. Comfortable, quality shoes! I get compliments on these shoes all the time. Brooks never disappoints!",
120237,5,07/12/2017,I really love my pure flow I use these for walking my dogs a couple miles a day. I have falling arches and plantar fasciitis. I need to wear good supportive athletic shoes.,
120237,5,07/08/2017,"Perfect Running Shoe The Pureflow 6 is light with the perfect amount of support, exactly the way I love my running shoe.",
120237,5,07/07/2017,So comfortable! ,
120237,5,07/06/2017,"SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY WITH THIS SHOE!!! I purchased my first pair of Brooks a few years ago and I've never looked back.  I was over-due for a new pair, but I was patient and waited until I found one that I loved.  Personally, I like sneakers with fewer color combos (often just black), so when I came across this style in the light grey and white I purchased them IMMEDIATELY!  I AM IN LOVE WITH MY NEW SHOES!!! I couldn't wait to show them off, but most importantly THEY'RE SO COMFORTABLE!  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.",
120237,5,07/05/2017,So far I like the Pureflow shoes. ,
120237,1,07/05/2017,"If you loved the PF4 you WON'T live these. I really, really loved my Pure Flow 4s and could not wait for the new 6 to come out.  They are nothing alike.  New 6s are WAY too wide and floppy.  Arch support is almost nonexistent.  My Pure Flow 4 that I retired as as lawn mowing shoes over a year ago are more comfortable.",
120237,5,07/05/2017,"Perfect Comfort! Love this shoe! I normally wear a more supportive shoe (the Adrenaline), but took a chance on this Pureflow neutral shoe due to how attractive it was in solid gray. I'm very glad I did! I may not have the same bulky, but sturdy, feeling that my old ones have, but the flexibility and comfort of this shoe are perfect! It hugs my foot everywhere without being too tight. It is cushioned everywhere without being too squishy or lumpy. Great at absorbing shock too when running and feels like you're floating.",
120237,3,07/03/2017,"Not like the pureflow 4 I have the pure flow for and I am absolutely in love with the shoes. I bought the pure flow six and they are not the same fit. They feel less cushy and slightly shorter in terms of height on the foot.  I love the design and color but not the right field for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.",
120237,1,07/01/2017,"Very Uncomfortable - No Support As soon as I tried on the PureFlow 6, I immediately knew it was not a good fit for me. It felt so narrow and extremely uncomfortable. To me, it felt like there was no cushioning or support. I returned it the next day. I'll stick with my new favorite, the Glycerine 15 -- IMO, the best shoe Brooks' has made to date. (BTW - Brooks' return policy & customer support is excellent!!)",
120237,5,07/01/2017,My favorite shoe! ,
120237,5,06/30/2017,"I would buy these again! I had a pair of PureFlow 4 and loved them.  I decided to try another brand (which remain nameless) next and I hated them!  Had to go back to PureFlow.  I read some negative things about the 5, so I went with PureFlow 6.  An expensive lesson learned: I will only run in Brooks now.",
120237,5,06/30/2017,"Perfect! This show if very cushioned and comfortable! I am used to a more structured shoe, but I changed it up to buy the Pureflow. I'm so glad I did, the shoe is just as supportive but with less bulk.",
120237,5,06/29/2017,Love this shoe I love this shoe.  I think it's the first running shoe that the tongue always stays put and there is a lot of arch support.  I would definitely buy this again.,
120237,5,06/29/2017,My best running shoes yet! I run most mornings and the PureFlow 6 actually fit just right. No rubbings at my toes and very comfortable. Love the colors I chose!,
120237,5,06/27/2017,"Fantastic Shoe It feels like this shoe was designed exactly for my running style. The limited cushioning around the front of the foot helps me to maintain my form and stride even when I get tired. I have been running for 15 years, and this might be the first shoe I have that actually fits properly without giving me huge callouses.  I wouldn't recommend using them for cross-training, however, as the supports are designed for a running stride and don't work as well for other actions (ie jumping, planks, etc)",
120237,5,06/26/2017,"I love these shoes! I have bought Brooks for  the last ten years- when I worked, I spent long days on my feet. Have retired and do lots of walking- found these to be perfect for foot comfort- I have hammer toe and bunion- toe box is roomy.",
120237,5,06/25/2017,Great Sneaker! ,
120237,5,06/24/2017,"Love the PureFlow 6 When I first put these on, they felt a little too short.  I was afraid that I'd have to return them.  However, after the first wear, they were perfect.  I really like the stability on the bottom and the ""stretch"" on the top.  They look cool, too.",
120237,5,06/23/2017,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Great shoe! I had the previous PureFlow and loved it. Once it was time to get new running shoes I switched to Asics, because I was trying to find the shoe that would be best for me. The Asics were okay. When those were beat up from running I decided to try the PureFlow 6 and quickly remembered how much I love Brooks! Definitely my go to running shoe. Love!",
120237,5,06/22/2017,I love these!! ❤️ I wear these my PureFlows all the time and I love them.  They are probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  I've recommended them to several people and they love them too!!,
120237,5,06/22/2017,"Awesome shoe! This is the best shoe i have ever worn!  After years and hundreds of miles running, i have finally found the perfect shoe!  Very light weight, great fit, supportive but not tight.   A lot of great colors.  They look good, fit good and feel good!  Please dont change this shoe and keep making it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!",
120237,5,06/21/2017,I will only buy brooks from here on out. These shoes have been great for work. I work at a hospital and I'm always running around. My feet do not hurt at the end of my shift so that has been great.,
120237,5,06/15/2017,"The perfect shoe for me Love the update on this shoe, I used to only run in Pureflow series, but was unimpressed with previous version of this shoe, but this update brings me back to the original Pureflow.  So lightweight and comfortable. Fits my foot like a glove, planning on running my upcoming marathon in these shoes, I love them!  I'm also loving how fun the peacock design is!",
120237,4,06/14/2017,I want to buy another one ,
120237,1,06/13/2017,Did not like these ,
120237,4,06/11/2017,"Major improvements - tongue issues persist I love PureFlows and have owned a pair since the very first version came out. They just fit my feet and stride so well. However, the tongue on the PureFlow 6 is made from the same material as the 5, and features the tapered end (part that sits on your foot) that still cuts into my ankle when I run. The fit of the 6 is more like previous models (except the horrible 5) in that the toe box is wider and the ride is cushiony smooth. I'm going to keep running with my 6's and see what happens, but I really wish Brooks would have listened more to their loyal community of runners and just re-designed the tongue completely, versus keeping the same form and materials, just adding cushion to the middle of it.",
120237,4,06/06/2017,"For inside circuit training they are very comfortable. Great shoe for circuit training, haven't actually ran outside in them but not sure they are the best shoe for long runs.",
120237,5,05/31/2017,"Love these shoes! These shoes are incredibly light and comfortable, and putting them on feels like stepping into a spaceship.  I wear Brooks Ghost in my day-to-day, but I like these as racing shoes, and I recently wore them without socks in a triathlon without any issue.  I was worried about the size since there wasn't a wide option available, but the toe area is pretty roomy, and I didn't need to size up.  These shoes look so good and make me feel awesome, I'm a big fan.",
120237,5,05/24/2017,"Lifesavers for my back I have back issues, work at Sonic and these shoes are a life saver. The only down fall is their life expectancy. I wear them out quicker than I'd like because I wear them all the time, for work and pleasure.",
120237,2,05/23/2017,"Wanted to Love these, but... I really wanted to like these, especially because the peacock pattern is the bomb! I bought them because I like a zero drop shoe and wanted to use these both in the gym for HIIT classes and for a park boot camp (stroller strides) and also because they matched my shoe profile. Unfortunately I have to disagree with all the reviews saying they helped reduce supination--I felt like I was going to roll my ankles when walking or attempting lateral movement. The outer edges of the heels are very rounded and made the shoe feel very unstable. I ended up getting the Pure Cadence and LOVE those--much better stability!",
120237,5,05/22/2017,I have multiple foot problems and these are the only I wear I have multiple foot problems planters facilitis and nerve problems that need surgery and I could barely walk.  These are the only shoes I can do some walking without pain.  My doctor liked them so much because for the cushioning and good arch that she went and bought a pair.,
120237,3,05/22/2017,Toe box not deep enough I only wear Brooks but this one was too snug in the toe box for my liking. GTS's are my shoe for sure.,
120237,5,05/16/2017,"PureFlow 6 is 5 STARS Love this shoe!  comfortable, great arch support, I recommend trying on different brands and THEN try this one...what a difference",
120237,5,05/16/2017,"PureFlow is Back! PureFlow is back in the game. Tried the 5s when they came out and had to return. Resorted to buying up every pair of 4s I could put my hands on. Ordered the 6s after exhausting my stockpile of 4s and reading the reviews. Was so happy to see Brooks listened. Like the wider toe. Usable right out of the box, no break in time. Did have to end up returning and getting a 1/2 size larger, but that did the trick.",
120237,5,05/16/2017,"Great running shoe I had several pairs of the pure flow 5 and liked them.  I saw the feather pattern on the pure flow 6 so I figured I would try them out.  They fit and feel so much better than the 5s.  They have more room in the toe area, feel lighter, and more flexible.  I have only run on sidewalks with them so I cannot say how well they hold up or how they do on different surfaces.  So far I enjoy them and look forward to wearing them out and buying another pair.",
120237,5,05/15/2017,"Thank you Brooks! I'm so so happy you updated the Pureflow to be more like the older models. The Pureflow 2 was my GOLDEN shoe - I absolutely loved it and wore my pairs to death until I couldn't find them anymore. The 3s and 4s were ok but not as good, and the 5 was just awful. I ended up trying other models/brands to try to find another shoe that would work for me like my beloved Pureflow 2s, but nothing did - until you released the Pureflow 6. It's the first shoe that has worked for me in years.. I'll put up with reduced durability to have happy feet! Thanks again!",
120237,5,05/15/2017,"I would definitely buy this again! I run in the Launch 3 and I have added the Pureflow 6 to my line up and so far I'm glad I did! It feels more roomy than the Launch and it does have more cushion. I would say it fits between a half size too big and just right. The toe box is where I have more room than in the Launch which I think may be a good thing. My only concern with a more cushioned feel is that it might not last as many miles as my Launch do, but we shall see! I really like how it lets my foot naturally pronate the way it is supposed to and the light weight feel.",
120237,4,05/12/2017,"Another good Brooks shoe Good shoe, especially for everyday wear. I haven't been able to find my ""perfect"" long running shoe but this shoe prevents fatigue from standing all day at work and is good for low mileage.",
120237,5,05/12/2017,"Fabulous! These shoes were fantastic, and the peacock pattern was amazing. I've been training for a ironman 70.3 and these allow me to spread some of the wear from my normal Glycerin 14s. I wear them 4/7 days a week, mostly for weight training and shorter runs. Would 100% recommend!",
120237,3,05/11/2017,"Not for me I wanted to love these.  The PureFlow 2s were my absolutely favorite shoe.  These have changed a lot since the 2nd generation.  The arches were too high for me and made it uncomfortable to run in.  I  wear a normal size 7 shoe and went to an 8, which is normal for running shoes.  I'm currently wearing Brooks Launch, and purchased the Launch 4s and those work much better for me.",
120237,4,05/05/2017,Fits great and lightweight Like how this shoe feels on my feet.  Don't rub wrong on my feet and cause blisters like other shoes have.  Had the Brooks Connect 4 prior to these.,
120237,4,05/04/2017,"So far, so good I have terrible arches, ankles and knees and I'm only 26. I need the extra support in my shoe- especially for pronation control and Brooks' was a brand that was recommended to me by a sports doctor several years ago. I've only had the shoes for a couple of months, but they have been great. I have purchased Brooks' before, but I am always open to trying new styles. The last style I purchased wasn't super impressive, so instead of picking them out on my own I used the website's Shoe Finder. The shoe finder suggested the Pure Flow 6 and I do not have any complaints so far. I love the lightweight feeling and the added support in the soles makes even walking more comfortable for me and reduces my joint pain.",
120237,3,05/01/2017,"Really Good Again- Except Soles Are Rock Gardens As a owner of many of the prior Pure versions, I am pleased that the 6 returns to the roots. My one MAJOR complaint is that I have to remove a dozen rocks (no joke) from the bottom of the shoe with a screwdriver after every run that isn't 100% on pavement. Please return to the former soles without the deep wells.",
120237,4,04/30/2017,"comfortable, but quick to wear Best version of the Flow since the flow 3.  Wears incredibly fast, however.  First pair of flow 6 is smooth on the bottom where I land and they're only at about 200 miles.  Very comfortable though.",
120237,5,04/27/2017,LOVE these lightweight shoes! I love these shoes! They're the perfect minimalist shoe and the color is so cute. I get compliments constantly when I'm wearing them. They're perfect for weight lifting and light running.,
120237,5,04/26/2017,"Perfect Gym Shoe! Use this shoe running on the treadmill, elliptical, and while lifting. It's comfortable, supportive, and lightweight!",
120237,3,04/24/2017,"PureFlow6 I want to write a review for Pureflow6 because i like Pureflow and need Brooks to make improvement for the Pureflow7. I wore Pureflow 4. It's a clunky looking shoe but it's cushioning and comfortable. Pureflow5 is a sad story, nice looking shoe but too narrow in forefoot and I could not run with it. Finally Pureflow 6, the forefoot is wide enough for running but the cushioning of the bottom is missing. The bottom is either too thin in forefoot or too firm in the foam. Brooks need to go back to the cushion (in thickness and quality) of Purelfow4 for next update.",
120237,5,04/24/2017,"LOVE THEM!!! I love them! My favorite were the 4's, and i couldn't find them anywhere. The 5's were too narrow and gave me blisters. But now, the 6's are the best thus far. So good I think I may purchase 3 more pair to have on hand. I run half marathons and spend lots of time in the gym. The 6's are very comfortable, the width is great and I even love the new style. So much I just want another pair for work. I have also received many compliments.",
120237,5,04/23/2017,"Pure improvement! I use them for most of my training. Long runs, tempo runs, easy runs. I love the wider toe box on the 6 than in the 5. I fell in love with the pureflow series for a few reasons and that was one of them. I'm glad Brooks listened to feedback from the 5 and made the tongue more flexible as well.",
120237,5,04/22/2017,I'm in LOVE with my shoes I love these shoes.  I've been wearing other Brooks shoes but the arch in them actually aggravated a knee issue.  My current Brooks area absolutely perfect and I'm ready to buy my second pair.,
120237,5,04/21/2017,I am buying another pair today. They are one of the best pair of shoes I have ever bought. I am going to order another pair. Everyone at work likes them.,
120237,5,04/19/2017,"Love This Shoe!!! Wow! I have always loved your ""Pure"" line of shoes, but the Pure Flow 6 is even more awesome than previous shoes I have owned! Super-comfortable right out of the box. Great arch support, toe box leaves plenty of room for toes (especially as feet swell on longer runs). As a mid-foot/toe runner I love the cushion, flexibility and mobility of the sole that allows me to push off forcefully and efficiently without restriction. Great engineering as well as super job on the design. A+++",
120237,5,04/19/2017,"New favorite running shoes! Great for any type of runs. Before I got these shoes, I was experiencing knee pain when running over 3 miles on the road, now I can run any distance (and on the road) without any knee pain!",
120237,5,04/17/2017,"Great shoes! Will definitely buy again. I'm not a runner, but I do enjoy walking. These are the most comfortable athletic shoes I've ever owned and they will make me get out and walk even more.",
120237,4,04/15/2017,feels good Have been wearing the Pure Flow for several years now.  did not like the changes made to the 5I did go up 1/2 size to safe my toenails and the pure flow 6 feels great!,
120237,5,04/15/2017,I love my PureFlow 6 shoes! ,
120237,5,04/15/2017,I love my new Brooks! ,
120237,4,04/15/2017,Would buy again I am trying to decide whether I like this shoe for light running (3-4 miles) or cross training. I love how light they are but may add an insert just because I have a really high arch. The shoe is flexible and looks great,
120237,5,04/14/2017,These are my perfect running sneakers These are so comfortable and lightweight and the perfect pair for me as I am a toe-striker.,
120237,5,04/13/2017,Great Fit.  Great look for casual use - not just running I have used this shoe as my casual wear accessory.  It is really pretty and the color goes with anything.  I have many Brooks shoes and enjoy them all.  This one is becoming one of my favorites since the color is so unusual.,
120237,4,04/13/2017,"Nice shoe I like like the look and feel of the PureFlow 6 however, they don't seem to be as comfortable as the Ghost when wearing all day for work etc.",
120237,5,04/11/2017,PureFlows are BACK! I loved the PureFlow 4's and I bought the 5's based on how much I liked the 4's... but the 5's were different from the beginning and I didn't like them nearly as much. After reading the reviews on the 6's I decided to give the PureFlow's another shot and I am SO glad that I did!,
120237,3,04/11/2017,"getting better This version of the pure flow is getting back to what I liked on the first 3 versions. It could still use a little more cushion, but is definitely better than the last 2 versions. Hopefully, Brooks will tweet it a little more for the next version so that it's even better.",
120237,5,04/10/2017,Great shoe I was concerned that this shoe wouldn't work with my wide feet. (Not offered in a wide sizes) But it does! Super comfortable and lightweight. I'd like to purchase another pair in black.,
120237,5,04/10/2017,Perfect shoe! I have wide feet so I was nervous that these shoes would feel narrow. They are comfortable on my wide feet. Super lightweight and perfect! I would like to get a second pair in black!,
120237,4,04/10/2017,"Great running and training shoes These shoes make me feel like I'm walking/running on clouds. I use them for lifting as well as running. I had Pumas before I switched to Brooks, and my only regret is not switching sooner. They look like they would be heavy, but they feel so light on my feet. They give really good support as I run or lift. I've run outside during dry weather and they were very comfy as well. It's worth noting that I wore these shoes to a cycle class and got a little blister on my right arch. I'm not sure if it's just the shoe that needs to be a little more worn in, or the way my foot was placed. I've only worn them to one cycle class, so I can't say too much about that.",
120237,5,04/08/2017,Best Running Shoe Ever! So regret not buying these before my half marathon! They are the best! Will def buy again!! I ordered. Half size up running.. but I think my regular size would of been okay!!,
120237,5,04/06/2017,Great shoe! I had been wearing the Launch for several years. When I ordered my last pair one of the shoes had been rubbing my toe. Sent them back and decided to try the Pure Flow 6 and I'm so glad I did. They're so comfortable and have really good arch support. I will definitely continue this style shoe,
120237,5,04/05/2017,Greatest shoes ,
120237,3,04/03/2017,"Wider than previous PFs I have been running in pure flow shoes since they came out (with a pair of Launch shoes thrown in there too) and have always raved about these shoes! I love the color (the gray and light blue) and really want to like them.  They feel very loose in the toe box as well as very wide throughout the shoe.  I compared to my old pair and they are definitely bigger shoes despite being the same ""size.""  I have only put about 50-60ish miles on them so far, so I am hoping they will feel better once I break them in more.  Right now, I'm having a little arch pain (fingers crossed it's not plantar fasciitis!!) which I never got in previous pairs.  Overall, I'm not giving up on my pure flows, but it is not my favorite version!",
120237,5,04/02/2017,"Brooks, I am back.... I had ditched Brooks after a series of uncomfortable Ghost models but liked the looks of the PureFlow 6, so thought I would give it a try.  Love this shoe!  Comfy (even in the toe box where my bunion usually gets scrunched), good looking, and light.  I am going to buy another pair for work.  Nice job, Brooks!",
120237,4,04/02/2017,"Almost perfect... I received these shoes about a week ago and overall they are great. They were comfortable right out of the box and are very lightweight. They are great for basic gym activities and walking, which is what I've used them for so far. I've only run into one issue. I work out at a gym where we do HIIT and part of that includes use of a water rower for about 1/3 of the hour workout time. The construction of the heel/ sole of the shoe just does not allow me to keep my feet in the heel strap of the rower! It won't wedge in there. My foot just keeps popping right out of the strap, which is pretty inconvenient when you are trying to keep up a rowing pace. It has to be something with the sole design of this particular shoe. I am still debating, but I like them so much otherwise and they are so cute compared to most of other Brooks styles and crazy color combinations that I am probably going to keep them for walking and normal life activities. My Glycerin 13 shoes fit great into the rower and so did the Ghost 9 shoes that I am returning because my feet don't feel stable in them. Overall this is a great shoe! I just have this one very specific performance problem with them for one exercise activity I happen to do a lot of.",
120237,4,03/29/2017,"Better than the Pureflow 5 A much better shoe than the Pureflow 5, but still not up to par of the Pureconnect that I've still been running in. I ordered a 6.5 (which is what my Pureconnects are) and the Pureflow was much wider, so I sent back for a size 6. I also noticed blisters on the ball of my foot from the first few runs, but of course that area will callous and won't be a problem. A much better shoe and responsive to road running. I don't recommend these for the gym and lifting due to the cushioning of the shoe.",
120237,4,03/27/2017,Love these shoes! I am training for Bloomsday and a sprint triathlon. They are great for distance running. Very comfortable. No cons to date.,
120237,4,03/27/2017,"Intense shoe! Normally I run in Glycerin, and I wanted to try a different feel.  The PureFlow is different...but in a good way!  Feels simultaneously more structured and lighter weight.  Responsive.  Less cushioning than Glycerin, but not so much less that you feel minimalist. Strong shoe that makes me feel fast :)",
120237,5,03/24/2017,Favorite shoe! ,
120237,5,03/23/2017,"My go to everyday shoe! I run the int Ghosts, but bought these for casual use. I wear them to grocery shop, when traveling, to the park, etc. The design is so eye catching and they are comfortable!",
120237,5,03/21/2017,"Amazing Shoe! I don't normally write reviews, but these shoes are incredibly comfortable to walk, jog, run...anything in! They are lightweight, have great support, and don't feel too bulky (I usually wear minimalist shoes - not toe shoes, but close to the ground as possible). I worried these would feel too padded / cushioned, but they're perfect! Highly recommend to anyone.",
120237,5,03/19/2017,"Comfortable on the first run These were recommmeded to me at a running store based on my running habits and style--about 15-20 miles per week, in need of stabilization for my heels, like the feel of a low drop. This shoe is light, comfortable with the right amount of structure balanced with a natural feel. Compared to the 5, the tongue is softer and more comfortable. Good improvement. Good shoe.",
120237,5,03/19/2017,Shin splints GONE! I just bought the Brooks Ravenna and had horrible knee pain and shin splints.  I have always worn brooks with knee pain once the shoes wear down but was shocked when my new Ravenna's caused me so much knee pain and even shin splits.  I decided to try the PureFlow and was amazed!  My shin splits are gone and so is my knee pain.  These are very light and very comfortable.  Highly recommend.,
120237,4,03/18/2017,"Much improved, but still not the old PF I had a precious version a few years back and fell in love with these shows. Since then no versions have been comparable until now. Only thing this shoe lacks is the excess cushioning and comfort the heel feels a bit tight but I'm convinced it'll wear in.",
120237,5,03/18/2017,Great shoe! They were a little stiff the first use but provide a great amount of support. I believe I will wear them in over a few uses. I am excited to use them for outdoor running when the weather warms up.,
120237,5,03/18/2017,Love Them ,
120237,4,03/17/2017,"Happy with the 6 I've owned all iterations of PureFlows except for the 5's, which had many bad reviews and negative comments.  When I noticed the favorable response to this latest update, I was hopeful and got a pair.  I find them quite comfortable, with ample width, and ready to go right out of the box.  They have nice forefoot cushioning and great arch support while continuing to be lightweight and responsive.  My favorite model so far was the PureFlow 2.  The 6's are a little more stiff than the 2's, and I miss the wrap-around tongue, but overall, I'm happy.",
120237,5,03/16/2017,These shoes are great! I use these shoes when working out at the gym and they fit great. Other shoes would hurt my feet but these are very comfortable.,
120237,5,03/15/2017,"Really comfy Bought these after basically running my pureflow 4s to the very last possible mile. Didnt want to buy the 5s and I hate having to find a new brand/model. Got these after hearing that they moving back toward the 4s with this year's version. Really glad I did. So far, so good.",
120237,4,03/12/2017,"Much Better! I loved the Pure Flow 1-3s and could handle the 4s.  I avoided the 5s and am glad the 6s are much better!  The roomier toe box is back, and the shoe feels broken-in from the first run (unlike the 4s which took hundreds of miles to feel comfortable).  Aside from wishing the attached tongue was back, the only thing I don't love is the weird sole, but that's only noticable sporadically during long runs.",
120237,5,03/11/2017,"Best Running Shoe I've EVER Had I first ran with the PureConnect 4s and I LOVE them. They are starting to show the miles I've put on them, so my boyfriend bought me these. I ordered a half size up, and they are truly the best shoe I've ever had. I had really high arches and these have no need for added arch inserts. I also have slightly narrower than regular feet, and I love how they fit through the middle with plenty of room in the toe box. I wore them straight out of the box and ran in them. No need to break them in. I absolutely adore them and I plan on ordering 2 more exact pairs.",
120237,2,03/10/2017,"Received detective shoes I purchased these shoes on Feb. 12, Purchase number:02036640.I am disappointed in this purchase ahs believe I received a pair of defective shoes. I have worn these shoes for 2 weeks and both of them are  squeaky the glue type seam that holds the shoe together is apparent and is coming loss all along the front. I have heard such great things about this brand this is my first experienced and I am very disappointed.  I hope this coming can resolve this.I hope someone contacts me in regards to this",
120237,4,03/10/2017,"Much better than the 5, but wider. You fixed the stiff tongue that the 5 had, but the toe area is a little roomy and the shoe is super light.  Too soon to tell if I like the lightness!",
120237,5,03/08/2017,"Would recommend to everyone! The questions really helped me chose a shoe. I love the shoe!! Fits well, my back doesn't hurt after a days work. Very cushy . Knees don't hurt as bad after working out!",
120237,5,03/08/2017,"Awesome!!! PF's are Back!!! PF5's, were in a word, HORRIBLE...could not even walk in them. I ran my PF4's to death awaiting the PF6's, so worth the wait, just lace and go. I plunk in arch supports for that extra comfort, but that is just me. Thank you Brooks for listening to the consumer and bringing back the PF's we all so love. I find them especially great for higher MPH...",
120237,3,03/06/2017,"Better than the 5, but still not where they need to be! I LOVED the pure flow 4s. They were my shoe for nearly two years. I have been patiently waiting for the 6 as the 5s were just plain terrible. I ordered my normal size and a half a size up in the 9.5 given the reviews I saw stating they ran even narrower in the toe box than the 4s. I went with the 9.5 given that my big toe was rather close to touching in the 9s and have been pretty happy with them. However, after one of my long runs this past weekend, the middle of the toe box lost it's integrity and split. This indentation rubs on the inside of my big toe and is rather uncomfortable. I'm rather disappointed. Not sure if I should have stuck it out with the 9s instead of the 9.5s or it's just the shoe....",
120237,5,03/05/2017,Thank you-wider toe box! Thank you for improving the Pure Flow 6! The PF5 toe box was too narrow-I ended up getting rid of them for Mizuno's. I'm so happy Brooks brought back a wider toe box for the 6's!,
120237,4,03/04/2017,"Great running shoe I am really enjoying this running shoe. It is fast, looks good and corrects my form so that I run correctly without injury. Launch is what I have been running in which I really like but if you are looking for something a bit lighter and faster this is for you. It is definitely for working out and not just walking around in my opinion. I was a bit dismayed though that it came and the tongue of the shoe had not been trimmed and was a bit frayed and apparently had not been inspected. This did not impact functionality of the shoe but I was surprised that Brooks would ship something out in this condition. Seemed a bit sloppy for them.",
120237,3,03/02/2017,im still waiting for pureflow 3s to come back im on my feet 12hrs for work. the shoes look great but it felt like a minimalist shoe. not enough heel support for my plantar fasciitis and my feet started to hurt after a couple hours wearing them. I had to return them.,
120237,3,03/02/2017,im still waiting for the pureflow 3s to come back im on my feet for 12 hours and i need good cushioning. im still waiting for pureflow 3s to come back because they were the best shoe ive ever had.,
120237,5,03/02/2017,"Yes!!! I tried the Pure Flow shoes when they first released several years ago, and have pretty much had the same ones since then.  I've gotten some on clearance at stores to save money, and just kept it going.  I loved those shoes!  They were the most amazing things I've ever put on my feet!So I splurged and bought myself the new version a few months ago (the Pure Flow 5), and I was SO disappointed.  They were tight, small, and generally uncomfortable.  I thought maybe my feet had grown and I didn't realize it.  Sadly, I returned them.Then I heard that Brooke's was going back to the original design with the 6, so when they released I nervously bought a bought a pair.  I'm so glad I took the chance, because they are great!  I'm so happy.  I actually wear them all the time they're so great.  I might have to buy a couple more pairs....Brookes...don't fix something that isn't broken just to release a new edition.  These shoes are classic!  Just add more colors!",
120237,5,03/01/2017,"Loved PureFlow 2, hated 4 and 5, and LOVE PureFlow 6 Absolutely love this shoe! So happy the wider toe box is back! The 3-4-5 models just didn't work for me, so I had about 10 pairs of the PureFlow 2. I will likely purchase as many of this model.",
120237,2,02/28/2017,"I miss PureFlow 4's! I've had several pairs of PureFlow 4's.  I passed on the 5's.  I didn't care for the look at all, and the reviews were terrible.  I like the look of the 6's better than the 5's, but honestly prefer the look of the 4's.  The ""cushioning"" on the bottom of the insole is SO hard to compress!  The soles are rigid and inflexible in comparison to the 4's.  The soles of my feet literally felt beat up after just a 4 miler on their first outing.  I tried them again a couple of days later for a 6 mile walk thinking maybe they'd loosen up a bit, but my feet felt beat up again at the end of just a walk.  I opted for my old worn out pair of 4's for my 10 miler the next day, and they felt like a dream compared to the 6's.  I really wanted to love the 6's, but unfortunately I'm returning them.  I was in love and don't know how to replace the 4's.  I did appreciate being able to get a pair of shoes in black and silver, rather than some gaudy color combination.",
120237,2,02/28/2017,"Really wanted to like this shoe... Have worn these for a couple of months now.I was hoping for a slightly more cushioned version of the old Pure Connect, which actually enhanced your stride. But the sole is much stiffer than the earlier shoes (probably will last longer) so it feels like it's fighting you all the way. Plus the heel cup in the shoe is much tighter than the earlier shoes, which wouldn't be a big deal if it was well positioned. But while the heel cup on the right side is properly placed, the left side is slightly tilted making it not very comfortable. And as a personal preference - I liked the somewhat turned up sole on the Pure Connect, which significantly reduced tripping hazards when running trails.",
120237,5,02/22/2017,"Like running on a cloud I've been running in the Pureflow for many years. I've always loved this shoe and the ability to wear it straight from the box to the road. Based on the poor reviews, I opted not to buy the 5's. These pureflow 6 are better than previous models. The redesign is fantastic. First, they are so much better looking than previous designs. Second, they feel lighter and more responsive. I really felt like I was running on a cloud. These are fantastic.",
120237,5,02/19/2017,"Great shoe! I tried the PureFlow 5 and wasn't super impressed, but decided to try the PureFlow 6 to see how it'd changed. I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This shoe quickly became my go-to training shoe. It's lightweight and comfortable. Two days after it arrived I did a 20 mile long run in it and had no issues (no blisters, no arch pain, nothing). If you're looking for a shoe with a small heel to toe drop I highly recommend you give this shoe a try - even if you didn't like version 5.",
120237,2,02/03/2017,"Disappointed... I purchased the Pureflow 6 for my running workouts. Pureflow 6 is a beautiful shoe, and the colors are amazing. Unfortunately, my big toes could not handle being stuffed inside the toe box of this shoe.I usually order a size 12 in running shoes (I wear a size 11 or 11.5 in regular shoes), but this size 12 felt too small. I wish Brooks offered a size 12.5 or 13 for the Pureflow 6. I felt fine while walking in this shoe, however, running caused numbness during my run, and sore big toes the next day. Also I felt like my big toenail would eventually rub a hole through the upper mesh of the toe box after a few runs.Sadly, I am returning this product.",
120237,2,02/02/2017,"Such a sad departure from the Pure Flow 4 I want to still love Brooks... I really do. But can we talk about the Pure series 5 and 6? We all know the 5's were a rough update... so I patiently rotated my old 2's, 3's and 4's to get every last mile out of them until I could purchase the 6's (hoping you had heard your faithful customers loud and clear and would return to the much better designed and more comfortable earlier models.) And, they are such a disappointment. Sure, the tongue no longer rips my ankle to bloody shreds like the 5's did (props!) but the base is still so stiff and painful. I've had them for 4 weeks (pre-ordered them and picked them up on the first day available) and logged over 100 miles and they still feel like I just duct taped some 2x4's to my feet and headed out for a jaunt. My calves and shins are constantly fatigued, and I just can't pretend that these shoes are my sole mates any longer.... after owning no less than 14 pairs of Pure series shoes and faithfully replacing them every 2-3 months when I hit 350 miles. I'm breaking up with Brooks... and I'm kind of heartbroken. Please please please listen to your clientele and bring back the 4's... they weren't broke and they didn't need fixin'!",
120237,5,01/27/2017,"THE BEST! This is far and away the best running show I've used in years.  The PF 5 just did not work for me, but I'd run in the 4s and 3s and liked them.  I can say without a doubt the 6 is even better.  Lightweight with just enough cushion and arch support, plus no correction so I can run without my knees and hips getting jacked.  Love them.  Buying two pairs as backup for the sad day Brooks discontinues them.  The only negative I've noticed (and this is very minor) is that the tread tends to pick up rocks and acorns, so I have to pick them out 2-3x/run if I hit the trails.  But depending on your terrain, it might not even be a concern.",
120237,5,01/22/2017,"They Fixed the mistakes Pure Flows are back ! I've run in Pureflow for the last 5 years and was very disappointed in the Pureflow 5 Bought them and promptly returned them the toe box was too narrow entire show ran tight . I bought as many pairs of the Pureflow 4 as I could get my hands on to hold me over in anticipation of PureFlow 6. Brooks redeemed themselves with this shoe !  Nice wide toe box extra support at the Heels, and same lightweight shoe. Thank You Brooks just in time for Marathon training !!",
120237,5,01/09/2017,"Pure Flow 6 is great again I have been running in Pure Flow and Pure Connect since the beginning. Was very disappointed when the Pure Connect was discontinued, so I went to go buy a new pair of Pure Flow 5s last year. Didn't buy them after trying them on, they were extremely narrow, the upper felt inflexible and ""plasticy"" and worse of all, the tongue cut into the front of the ankle. And that was just walking around the store.  I've been runnning in old Pure Connect 3s and a couple other brand running shoes that I'm just not crazy about. I bought the Pure Flow 6 last weekend as soon as they came out. I have run 4 times in them since, including a long run of 10 miles. My  beloved Flows are back. This version had a wider toebox than the 5s. The upper is totally seamless so I am not have any rubbing on my bunions which is common with me. The tongue is comfortable, it is similar to the tongue in the Pure Flow 4. The ride is great, I would compare it to the Pure Flow 4. There is plenty of durable rubber on the bottom which hopefully make these shoes pretty durable. So far they are extremely comfortable out of the box. A couple of things I noticed, though. The insole has a weird segmented bottom. I could feel the bumps of the insole. This was easily fixed but swapping it with an insole from another old pair of shoes. Also I noticed that the shoes feel kind of hot in the heat. I live in S. Florida though, so this won't be an issue for most people.",
120238,5,12/27/2017,Love my new Brooks Ravenna 8 ,
120238,5,12/27/2017,My glass slipper Absolutely love this sneaker. Found this style a few years ago at my local running store and haven't looked back since. This is my fourth Brooks Ravenna sneaker; I don't believe I'd ever get anything else as far as running goes.,
120238,2,12/26/2017,Didn't Compare Well to the Ravenna 7 The Ravenna 7 had a cushiony & great fit so I was excited to try the Ravenna 8.  The width (even though I ordered the wide width) felt too narrow.  I didn't feel the same cushiony support that the Ravenna 7's had.  The foot bed had no comfort level at all for me.  My feet hurt after my 3 trial runs.,
120238,2,12/20/2017,"Completely different than the R7 I've run in the Ravennas for the past 3 years with zero problems. I figured the 8 would be the same but no, it's significanly narrower than the 7 and the tongue comes up a lot higher than it did on the 7. They changed the lacing too which puts awkward pressure on my foot. It's not that it rubs  but it's certainly less enjoyable to run in than the previous version. I used to love the Ravennas because they were wider in the footbed. Yes, the mesh in the tow box wears out after running in them for a summer but the rest of it holds up so well. I've gone back to my worn out R7s and wish I could find more. I'd go ahead and buy 5 pairs.",
120238,2,12/19/2017,Worst Ravenna model I have run in Ravennas for over 10 years and have had no issues so have never switched. The Ravenna 8 changes causes a pain on the top of my foot where the tongue is not cushioning my foot from the lacing system. I can't even wear them sitting still without them hurting where they have injured my foot from running. I have been wearing old Ravenna 7s and New Balance vongos for running and have no pain at all. I'm returning the brand new pair of ravenna 8s that I have in my closet. I hope this is fixed for the next model!,
120238,1,12/19/2017,"Cannot get comfortable fit I am greatly disappointed in this Ravenna. I have 2 pair of Ravenna 5 that I cannot live without. The new Ravenna does not compare. I cannot lace them comfortably, the foot seems to angle slightly backward making an awkward position.",
120238,3,12/18/2017,Runs 1/2 size bigger than all prior Ravenna's I've had dozens of pairs of Ravenna shoes from the first version through the 7. All in the same size. The 8's seem at least a 1/2 size bigger. Bummed because I've worn them running and didn't realize sizing seemed off.,
120238,5,12/18/2017,Wouldn't wear anything else ,
120238,5,12/16/2017,I finally found my right size! Very comfortable and light weight. I'm so happy I've finally found the right size and width combination for my feet.,
120238,4,12/15/2017,"A fun shoe but questionable quality This shoe is very fun to run in - the energy return is the reason I keep coming back to the Brooks brand... but. I too am having the problem another reviewer has mentioned - the mesh upper shows wear very quickly. I'm worried the upper will wear out before I've put enough miles on the shoe to feel ready to invest in another pair.Overall, I like the shoe but will be exploring new styles when it's time to replace this pair.",
120238,2,12/12/2017,"Not Like the R7 I only wear Brooks - whether I run or walk they are my Go To! The R8 tongue never sat right on either shoe. It is the MOST uncomfortable model you have ever made. I like many others am searching for the R7. I loved that shoe! I will not wear ASICS, but you guys are going to need to take a look at the design since you are getting less than positive feedback....",
120238,2,12/08/2017,"What happened?!? 7s so much better. I upgraded to the 8s from the 7s two months ago, but have yet to really have a comfortable run in them. My arches start to hurt after a few miles, and the tongue on one of the shoe consistently will not stay still! And after a particularly long run, I ended up with a Morton's Neuroma. If I hadn't worn my 7s down, I'd go back to them.I don't know what they did to the 8s, but it was not good....",
120238,5,12/07/2017,Awesome!! I walk about 2 miles a day at 6:00 and and work with a kettle ball. Great support from the shoes!,
120238,2,12/05/2017,Miss the 7s The Ravenna 7s were way better. I have looked everywhere searching for 7s -with no luck! The Ravenna 8 just isn't as comfortable...and I have had knee and calf pain since I have started using them. Not good...I'm actually taking a week off to heal. I might consider changing brands before I start again though,
120238,3,11/30/2017,"Half size too big These are a half size too big compared to my other Brooks.  I am normally a 7 but I am a 6.5 in these.  These do feel more flat and stiff than I'm used to but the arch does say flat so there ya go!  Not saying anything bad about these shoes though, it just comes down to preference. I feel like this a good baseline shoe for someone who does not have high arches or just wants to get running without figuring out all the different types (b/c it's overwhelming at first!) so it is probably a good universal shoe.",
120238,2,11/30/2017,"Please bring back Ravenna 7's Style Toe box is too narrow, causing numbness in feet. I've ran in 7's for years & now the search is on for a different shoe. Fingers crossed the 8's toe box will be wider.",
120238,3,11/28/2017,"comfortable, but toe area is narrow. These are ok.  I like Asics better, but perhaps a different model of Brooks would change my mind.",
120238,3,11/27/2017,Love my Ravennas... Just not the 8's I've been wearing Ravennas for YEARS and have loved every pair- great quality and performance. Unfortunately this is not the case with the 8. The mesh around the toe is tearing less than 200 miles in and the rubber on the bottom of the toe box is wearing much faster compared to my previous models. I hope brooks will make some improvements before releasing the 9.,
120238,3,11/26/2017,"I miss the 7's I've been wearing Ravennas for several years (& Brooks overall for more than 5 years). I love the overall support of the Ravenna's but am highly disappointed by the 8's. The holes were moved for the laces and the tongue seems too large for the shoe and bulges - my husband thought I mis-laced my shoes. I've scoured the internet trying to find 7's I can buy, sadly to no avail! Please revert to 7's style when you make the 9's!",
120238,5,11/25/2017,"Great shoes I would wear these shoes all the time except it's the rainy season here. I would love to have the Ravenna in a gortex (GTX) style in my size, but that isn't available. Maybe one day.",
120238,5,11/25/2017,Love I love how springy these are and they are a great new shoe for me as the adrenaline's were just a bit TOO supportive.,
120238,2,11/24/2017,"Loved Ravenna 7s, the 8s made me switch to Saucony. Loved the Ravenna 7s, but I disliked the 8s so much after only 5-6 runs and 20 miles or so that I sought out a replacement.  I ended up with the Saucony Ride 10s.  I didn't like the Ravenna 8s because compared to the 7s, the 8s have too stiff of a sole, the toe box is narrower (the comfy toe box of the 7s was great), while the rest of the shoe is too wide (even the runner's knot couldn't fix the too-wide heel).  In addition, the height between the sole of your foot and the top of your foot was decreased in the 8s, so the top of my foot is now sore and achy which was never a problem in the 7s.  I was never aware that I was even wearing shoes in the 7s, but the 8s are too much of a distraction when I run, I felt like I had to compensate for the weaknesses of the shoe, to the point that I wasn't always confident of my footstrike.  It's not an awful shoe at all, I just loved the 7s, and the 8s definitely aren't for me.",
120238,4,11/22/2017,"I'm keeping my fingers crossed You'll never believe this but I've been wearing the Brooks Cadence TWO for YEARS. I stocked up like the apocolyspe was coming. Now, it's time. My local running store doesn't carry the Cadence so after trying on 14 pairs of shoes, these were the winner. I took them out for a spin today and noticed instantly they were heavier than I'm used to but felt pretty good. The chubby tongue and lacing is awful. The colors are even worse than the chubby tongue and lacing. Come on Brooks!!! How about just black?? Or black and grey??I'm keeping my fingers crossed these work for me.",
120238,5,11/15/2017,First time buyer I have been wearing another brand of running shoe and decided to give this brand/model a chance since my daughter loves them. I love how bouncy they feel and I feel like my foot is secure in the arch. I am an injured runner who is walking many miles these days. I have worn them on 4 long walks and they feel great.,
120238,2,11/13/2017,The fabric over the toes has started to get small tears I am displeased with the wear and tear of the materials of the shoe covering in the first three months of use.,
120238,5,11/09/2017,"These ""dogs"" do the job in good and bad weather. ",
120238,5,11/07/2017,"LOVE THESE!  Super lightweight and fit great! I love how light they are!  And they still fit like the older styles, so no guesswork in sizing. And thankfully the strings are long enough to run through the holes around my ankles!",
120238,5,11/06/2017,My 10th pair of Ravennas! ,
120238,3,11/02/2017,"Beware of the Air Mesh I've LOVED the Ravenna's for awhile now, however, the 8's have changed the mesh on top to a more breathable material. BEWARE as after 200 miles, my shoes already have holes in the sides!! I typically have never experienced this before so thumbs down to changing that material. I am an experienced ex NCAA runner so I know my shoe quality. Hopefully they change this back in the future models as I'm going to have to buy a new pair after only 2 months of use.",
120238,5,10/30/2017,"Great support! This is my second time with Brooks, not in a row. When I went to buy new shoes I felt comfortable looking at this style because I knew I had already worn it. I tried it against another brand with a similar structure, but that other brand, rhymes with schmasics, was too squishy for me. The support on this shoe is great, especially for me, I've had 5 knee surgeries and no longer have an ACL. My one issue with brooks, although I do love this pink color, the colors are not always that pretty. But maybe I'm just a color snob.",
120238,4,10/29/2017,I love this shoe Great stability shoe without the weight. This is my third pair and will keep getting them. Fun color combo. #ReviewSweeps,
120238,4,10/27/2017,"Great, especially on long runs Only reason not 5 stars is because for some reason they become uncomfortable when I wear them standing for several hours (when I promote a run at an expo event).  But if I'm running  they are amazing! Just ran a 1/2 in them and while my legs were becoming fatigued, my feet felt great and no toe issues! (I normally have prior to these shoes)",
120238,4,10/26/2017,Like it but really miss the 7's😢 ,
120238,5,10/22/2017,Love The Ravenna Style I've been wearing the Ravenna style for 5 years. It's the only style that's I'll wear. I have flat feet and wear these without orthotics. In 5+ years I've  never had an issue with my feet!  Best running shoe ever!!!  #ReviewSweeps,
120238,1,10/19/2017,"Disappointed I wore my sneakers once and they did not provide the comfort my feet needed. My feet felt sore after running just once. I will be returning them for a refund, I just haven't been able to access a printer for the return label.",
120238,5,10/17/2017,My favorite running shoe Has nice spring and good support. Great for the longer runs and the shorter ones.,
120238,4,10/16/2017,"Super comfy, lots of support I have very wide feet and even though I ordered the wide they could have used a little more space. Overall really comfortable but had a few blisters the first 3 or 4 times I used them.",
120238,2,10/14/2017,Not as good as the 7 I wanted to love the 8 as much as the Ravenna 7 but sadly didn't. The toe box seems less roomy and I couldn't make it work. Otherwise the shoe felt comfortable possibly less arch support than the 7? Glad I found a pair of 7s on sale! Crossing my fingers the next Ravenna will work.,
120238,5,10/12/2017,Very comfortable! I use these for every day use with my custom made orthotics. These are extremely comfortable and help correct my flat feet and overpronation.,

120238,5,10/06/2017,"Love these shoes I have a pair to run in and a second pair to walk in. I love these shoes, comfortable and help with my form. The wide width is absolutely key.",
120238,5,10/02/2017,"I love Brooks Ravenna!! I absolutely LOVE this shoe!! Ever since I found this specific kind of shoe, it's been the only running shoe I wear. I've been to Disney twice in a little over a year and I wear these shoes basically the entire time!! My feet NEVER hurt! I will always buy these shoes!!",
120238,5,09/30/2017,"Love 'em! Sized 1/2 size up by my local running shop, same as my Ravenna 7s were. Only recently upped my training and mileage, and still haven't had any blisters. No slipping within shoe. Great fit.",
120238,2,09/26/2017,"Terrible update to what was a great shoe I loved the Ravenna 6s and 7s--I've been wearing some iteration of the Ravenna since I started running again over two years ago. That's why the Ravenna 8s are so disappointing. The toe box is too narrow, the tongue is too thick, and my feet were numb and sore before my 4 miles were even up. I even had a discount code for Brooks, but I've switched to New Balance for this year, at least.",
120238,3,09/26/2017,Not impressed ,
120238,2,09/25/2017,I prefer the 7's ,
120238,5,09/25/2017,"GREAT SHOES!!! I use these shoes to train for a half marathon. Straight out of the box, I ran 3 miles with nothing but amazing comfort!! At the end of the first week, I hesitantly wore my Brooks for my long run of 7 miles, still unsure if these were too good to be true... and I will never buy another brand of shoes! I am sold on Brooks for life!!! No blisters, no discomfort, only supremely comfy runs!",
120238,2,09/20/2017,I would not buy again The stability of the Ravenna 7 is missing in the new 8. I'll be looking for a new shoe. I loved the 7s:(,
120238,1,09/20/2017,Not the 7 The 8 did not last a fraction of the time the 7 did! The lacing is weird. The support has faltered within months.,
120238,3,09/19/2017,Not my favorite version of this shoe I've been wearing Ravenna's for about 5 years.  This is the most uncomfortable version yet.  Feels bulky and not breathable when I wear it. Laces are too tight across my foot due to the way they lace up. No problems with support or structure.,
120238,5,09/17/2017,Never disappointed with Brooks shoes ,
120238,3,09/13/2017,"Huge fan of Ravenna, just not the 8.. Huge fan of past Ravenna models, especially the 5 and 7. The 8 is weird. The way it ties over the tongue, there is a weird gap and it causes a pressure point where all the laces bunch up at the top. Also the tongue feels thick and bulky and makes the shoe generally feel uncomfortable. I couldn't get used to the way the laces and tongue felt to see how the ride was. It just bothered me too much. I won't give up on the Ravenna, excited for the 9 to come out in January. My 7 are getting pretty beat up.",
120238,4,09/13/2017,"Good, but not great I LOVED the Ravenna 7s, and they were absolutely perfect for long runs and my  moderate overpronation. The 8s have much of the same properties, but are a lot narrower in the forefoot. I have wider feet (complete with a long-time bunion companion), but have never needed wide shoes in the Brooks line, either Ravennas or Glycerins. It's slightly uncomfortable when breaking them in, but 85 miles in, they have gotten better. The tongue is also thicker, and moves a bit, a problem I've not had before, although it's really not an issue for me.",
120238,5,09/08/2017,I love my Brooks Great stability and if you have a little probation.  The hit is soft with a smmot recoil on my runs.,
120238,5,09/08/2017,The Ravenna is amazing I switch between the Brooks Adrenaline and Brooks Ravenna depending on the run. I find that it's a little less 'clunky' than the adrenaline and helps me feel faster when I want to fly. The base is built hearty and strong which is great because I've found a tack in the bottom of my sole and it protected my foot! Love the Ravenna. Definitely a must try,
120238,4,09/08/2017,"Love the feel! I love these shoes - I had the Ravenna 6 & 7, which were both ok, but these are the best I've ever worn. I feel like they're the right balance of cushion and support, and my knees and hips agree.My one star down is for the design. Why can't these come in better color options (and why do most of these look like 2 separate shoes stuck together)?",
120238,5,09/04/2017,"Increase Your Mileage I was hesistant to change brands of running shoes after seven years of having the ""Just do It"" brand. I'm glad I made the switch with Brooks, love the holistic support, comfort, and colors.",
120238,3,08/31/2017,"I like the shoe BUT I like how the shoe feels and I liked most of the color options BUT there are some things that I don't like. These were my first pair of Brooks so I'm not sure if this is normal but I have to order them a half size or full size bigger than my normal shoe size (I wore an 8 in my past running shoes. I had a second pair that were an 8.5 and the Brooks pair ended up being a 9). I do not like the tongue or how these shoes lace up. There is a big gap/loop in the middle of the shoe and  you can't avoid having it unless you lace your shoes without doing the cross method. I feel like the tongue is super puffy and that's what adds to it being uncomfortable on the top of my foot. My biggest issue is how fast they wore down. I bought the shoes in June and then wore them for 3 5k races in June/July. After my third race, the edges at the top of the shoe (where you foot goes in) had started to wear down or were spilt open. I just don't think that should happen after only having the shoes for 2 months and not doing any super intense exercise.",
120238,4,08/25/2017,"Please make in neutral colors!! I have chronic foot pain (plantar fascitis, neuroma, ankle instability), and these are one of two shoes that allow me to get on with my days. I liked the Ravenna 7, but the 8s are even better. I agree with one reviewer that they seem to wear down quickly - I do wear mine every other day but have to get a new pair every two months which still seems excessive. PLEASE PLEASE make these in neutral colors like white or black - at least have the black/gray men's version for women, too! You would sell so many more shoes if you took a cue from Adidas. I'd even love these in pastels like a white/soft pink combo, but that might be wishful thinking. The navy version is the only one I can bring myself wearing, the other clashing neon colors are just awful.",
120238,2,08/20/2017,"I really wanted to like them I really wanted to like these. I loved the Ravenna 4, but haven't found the subsequent releases as good. They are falling apart after 4 months. As another reviewer wrote, I have to lace them very loosely because the top of my left foot (the tendon that runs from the big toe) gets really irritated otherwise. Have never had shoes do that before.",
120238,3,08/14/2017,Bit disappointed this time These have been my favorite shoe for a long time.  This time though I only have 50 miles on these and the side up by the laces is starting to rip open and show signs of wear faster than previous Ravennas.,
120238,2,08/11/2017,"Ravenna 8 doesn't compare to Ravenna 7 I have been wearing the Ravenna 7 for the last 8 - 9 months for running, sprinting, cross-training.  I really loved the 7 but I needed a new pair of shoes and couldn't find the 7 anywhere so I ordered the Ravenna 8.  I have several issues with the 8: they are narrowing through the toe box (an especially sensitive place for me), and the tongue on the 8 is really, really chunky.  Also, the way in which they lace doesn't keep the tongue in place - it constantly slides to the side unless I have them tied really tight, which just increases the discomfort through the entire foot.  Not at all happy with this design.",
120238,2,08/09/2017,"Wont buy, too funky Tried these on in Runners Roost, they fit comfortable but I can't get over how ugly the colors are. I need something I can wear to work and walk around in all day and these purples and pinks are not my style or fashionable. Got Nikes instead.",
120238,2,08/02/2017,"Not the same Ravenna I had the 6's and 7's...while the foot bed was larger, they felt more supportive.  The 8's feel very different. Not as much cushion or support. Go back to the other model! Also, the mesh on the top started wearing out within the first two weeks wearing them. They are holding together for now, but I will definitely need to get a new pair faster than I have needed to in the past.",
120238,4,07/21/2017,"Love the feel of the shoe, but don't love the color. ",
120238,5,07/19/2017,"Best Ravenna since the 6 The Ravenna 8 returns to a true width. I've been wearing the Ravenna for several years, and the toe box had gradually grown wider and wider until it felt almost half a size to big. The Ravenna 8 has returned to a true fit toe box. I love this shoe. I also didn't have to do much breaking in. I ordered the shoe and ran a 5k the next day without any issues. Great shoe!",
120238,5,07/12/2017,Great shoe! I love the Ravannas 8. Comfortable fit. Toe box has lots of room. Has enough cushion to make my run feel good,
120238,4,07/11/2017,Not I recently purchased these after my favorite Adrenaline GTS were out of stock in my size at my local FF store. I was slightly hesitant considering my last three pairs of Brooks had been GTS. I was pleased with my purchase after running with them a few times before my ankle injury (pesky moving furniture down stairs). Even though they are the same weight as the GTS the felt lighter to me. I didn't have any shin splints or knee pain which was an indicator to me that they were doing their thing for my over-pronation. I've been wearing the pair I bought to work since I'm sidelined right now but bought a new pair to start training when this ankle is back to normal. Hopefully this will stay my shoe type for my Austin Half Marathon training!,
120238,2,07/08/2017,"Foot pain I have been loyal to Brooks Ravennas for years but the Ravenna 8 just did not work.  I developed pain on the top of both feet.  I buy Brooks because I have a wider foot and flat arches and have never had a problem with the normal width Ravenna until the 8.   I tried loosening the laces but that did not help and only contributed to more slippage on the heel now that the back heel cup is shorter, which is another problem.  Also, none of the colors were appealing to me, but I bought the Ravenna because I usually like the responsiveness of it.  Overall, this version is a bust.  I cant run in these and will be hoping the Ravenna 9 addesses these problems.",
120238,2,07/04/2017,"Disappointed with Ravenna 8 I loved the previous version of Ravenna, 6,7.  I have been using them non stop for three years.  I used them for training and running marathons and half marathons and my feet and legs felt great.  The Ravenna 8 is very different.  Is very hard, almost no cushion.  Every step I take is felt in my entire leg.  Please bring back the previous versions!!!",
120238,3,07/04/2017,"Pain on top of foot I have a narrow foot and high arches and I've owned the 6, 7 and now 8.  At first, I wasn't having any issues, they felt great during a half marathon and I've been putting about 20-30 miles a week on them.  Brooks made a lot of improvements that I personally liked compared to the 7.  However, the past couple of weeks I've been experiencing pain on top of my foot that is progresssively becoming more painful.  It feels like the area where you tie the laces is putting pressure on the foot.  Even after a 3 mile run it feels bruised.  I've tried adjusting and loosening the laces but haven't been able to find a way to get rid of this issue.",
120238,5,07/03/2017,"Best Ravenna since the 5! Thank you Brooks! Finally, these shoes feel like an extension of myself again. I never know what each version will bring and stock up on oldies I like (good with 3 and 4, searched out the 5 for years!, HATED clown shoes 6, ok with 7...). Now I am sad I stocked up on the 7s. Thank you for finally getting rid of the swollen tongue. Now, please stick with this and whatever overlaps with 5 and STOP messing with it!",
120238,1,06/30/2017,"Different than earlier versions I rarely take the time for reviews but saw others that have commented on how the 8 fits differently than the previous Ravenna. I have worn Ravenna for years and have absolutely loved them; however, I also have noticed considerable pain/discomfort when wearing these for workouts or hikes. I really hope Brooks responds to these concerns and brings back the Ravenna that is being sorely missed by more than just me.",
120238,3,06/30/2017,I would not recommend the Ravenna 8 My only complaint is the quality/craftsmanship in this pair I currently train in.It looks like I fell in them due to the ripping of the fabric on the shoe.Ive had them since may.Did one marathon in them and I only run three days a week.They look really worn and torn after just 2 months.Ive never had a pair of Brooks wear this badly and especially in a short amount of time.,
120238,1,06/15/2017,Not running happy The model changed the design and now after 2 half marathons in these shoes they do NOT offer the same support of the older models. I want my money back.,
120238,1,06/09/2017,Worst Ravenna ever This is the worst Ravenna ever! The arch support is not the same as previous models. They are cheap and wear quickly. I won't but Ravennas again until it goes back to how they were with support.  Please brooks go back to the 7s support type!,
120238,5,06/05/2017,"Pleasantly Surprised I'm fairly new to running and bought the Ravenna 7's last year because they were recommended to me by a local running/shoe store based on my running pattern. I wore those shoes out and knew I needed to get new ones when my shin splints started coming back after fairly short distances.  I read several reviews that said the Ravenna 8's were not as good as the 7's so I was a little wary about purchasing them, however, after using them for a couple months I have no major complaints.  My biggest complaint is that the wide width only comes in one color...and it's not even a very pretty one.  I do wish that Brooks would provide those of us with wide feet more options.",
120238,1,06/01/2017,"Nothing like the 7 This is nothing like the Ravenna 7. This show wears really quickly. Not even 150 miles and the shoes are wearing. This shoe is also to narrow compared to previous versions, and now start to cause blisters and makes the top of my foot hurt. I'm sad to say I have to change shoes after wearing this shoe for 3 plus years.",
120238,3,05/31/2017,They are okay ,
120238,5,05/18/2017,I LOVE BROOKS!!! I have a problem with recurrent Achilles tendon inflammation. Brooks is the only shoe (Ravenna especially) that does not hurt it at all. As an additional benefit it helps my plantar fascititis that occasionally flares up as well.  Most comfortable shoe I have tried.,
120238,2,05/15/2017,"A step in the wrong direction I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that these are like a completely different shoe than any of the other Ravennas. I absolutely loved the Ravenna 7 for its spring without compromising support. I ran my first full marathon in the Ravenna 7 and had no problems. I was disappointed to find that the Ravenna 8 felt much less supportive and slightly below average spring. Would be a nice shoe to wear around the gym but marathon training in these was not great. I miss the 7s so much, I hope Brooks goes back to what was working for the next version.",
120238,1,05/03/2017,"Disappointed with this shoe I wore them once and had a massive pain on the bridge of my left foot. Thought I might of tied to tight. So second wear I loosened laces, It was even more painful to the point I had to stop running/walking, foot felt like it was bruised. Let it heal a few days and tried shoe on and no change, massive pain from the top of the shoe. Bummed because every where else it feels great and right show no problems.",
120238,2,05/03/2017,"Still unsure... I am completely flat-footed and also need a wide shoe, and these shoes fit a bit too narrow for me.  This is the first pair of running shoes that I've bought that are made for overpronation.  I normally just buy a wide-width running shoe and use my orthotic inserts, but I thought I'd give this a try.  I immediately noticed that my legs were straighter, and the insides of my knees and my ankles were not hitting against each other as they often would do when I was running, but they hurt so much.  I'm not sure if my feet need to adjust and my muscles are just reacting to being used differently, but my feet hurt when I run in these shoes.  I can't run for very long (maybe only a mile) before I need to stop and flex my feet a bunch.",
120238,1,04/30/2017,"Totally different shoe than previous versions I wore the Ravenna 5s and 6s and loved them--they were one of the only shoes that fit my wider forefoot.  My feet aren't ""wide,"" but I struggled to find shoes with a slightly wider toebox.  The 8s have totally changed, the toe box is narrower and seems to push my toes forward so that I cannot actually engage my big toe.  I'm disappointed that it changed so much, the Ravennas were one of the best fitting shoes for my feet.  I ended up getting the Men's Ravenna, which has a wider toebox--while I don't mind this, I do prefer the women's colors :)",
120238,5,04/29/2017,"There's a reason I always come back to Ravenna Lots of room in the toe area.  In gym 5+ days a week.  Cardio classes and interval workouts.  These sneakers hold up to it all!  Love, love, love the colors too!",
120238,3,04/26/2017,Foot pain developed after wearing these:( I'm wondering if I have the right shoe for my foot?  I had the Ravenna 7.  Bought the Ravenna 8 and started having foot pain after wearing them for 6-8 runs.  I went back to my old shoes (before the Ravenna 7; Saucony grid) and my pain is gone.,
120238,1,04/19/2017,"worst Ravenna yet I've been buying Ravennas for about 6 years now, each couple months I try to get the newest style or one of the old ones. I bought this shoe two months before a marathon I'm training training for and it is painful to wear! I've gotten the worst shin splints that I've had since before wearing brooks. I can barely walk without my leg tensing up in pain. I won't order Ravennas AGAIN until they bring back one of the old versions. Do not buy these if you already have a history of shin splints!!!!!",
120238,2,04/17/2017,"Very disappointed, fabric wears out FAST! I bought these one month ago. I usually buy the Brooks Ghost line but didn't like the color choices this year, so thought I'd give the Ravenna a try since it was stylish and had great reviews (at the time). I walk or run 3-4 miles every day in the city. Overall, the shoe has held up great with the exception of the cloth part, there are holes in both shoes all over the cloth covered areas. This shoe also runs a half size small (I'm an 8 in the Ghost, a 7.5 in the Ravenna) and definitely more narrow...I don't notice the narrowness when moving as I pronate and that helps but it hurts a little if I wear for any period after walking. Next time I'll stick with the Ghost. Very disappointed in the quick wearing of the fabric, I expect more from Brooks. I would return but already threw away my receipt since I've never had a problem in the past.",
120238,1,04/13/2017,"Where the 6s at? I walk in these shoes all day long and then workout hard at night. I had the Ravenna 6s and they worked magically with pronation correction and eradicated my knee pain. These 8s, however, I was told by customer support they had the same stability as the 6s and they do not, in my knee's opinion as the pain is back. The style is definitely better but I feel this product has lesser quality.",
120238,1,04/12/2017,The Ravenna 7s are much better The Ravenna 7s and all previous models are so much better. They really changed the arch support in the 8s and they actually caused me to get planter fasciitis. At first I liked them and was excited but after 1 week of running the arch wasn't enough and really affected my training and I had to take a week off because of it. I ended up finding a 7 model online somewhere else but I do not know what I will do once those one wears out. Brooks change the support back to what it was please!!!!,
120238,5,04/08/2017,Amazing running shoe! I have a lot of problems with knee pain and running and these shoes have really helped. They are extremely comfortable!,
120238,3,04/08/2017,Top Mesh Breakdown Bought these to replace my Brooks Ghost 7s where my ankle/heal flipped in and got stuck in that position internally.  I hardly wore them at that point but they were comfortable for the most part until the flipped heal so I thought I'd try Brooks again.  These new Ravennas have worn so quickly where the top mesh has holes starting.  I play volleyball 3x/wk so maybe it's a bit much for these shoes.,
120238,4,03/30/2017,"Very Good Shoe Overall this is a great lightweight running shoe. I ran in the Ravenna 4's and 5's. I was disappointed with the 6's as the toe box was extremely uncomfortable and they felt a lot heavier than the 4's and 5's. I'm in the Air Force and use these for my PT test and for squadron PT. The shoe is extremely responsive and provides great support since I overpronate. I do feel a little heel slippage which is annoying, but I just try and ignore it since it isn't significant. Overall it is a great lightweight stability shoe and I would definitely recommend this for those who overpronate but want a lightweight shoe!",
120238,5,03/27/2017,"Out of the box and on the road in 20 minutes I have the 7's,which i wore down to nothing.  I was looking for a new shoe this month and liked the navy 8's.  I tried on about 7-8 other brands/styles and then the Ravenna.  I knew it right away!  Comfort, stability, it was all the same reasons I liked the 7's.  Needless to say, I bought them and immediately went for a 4 mile run about 10 minutes later.  I love them.",
120238,4,03/25/2017,"wonderful shoe! I've run in Ravena's for a few years now, loved the 5, 6, and now the 8. I didn't care for the 7's so skipped them. Tried the 8's and love them. They are a bit more narrow in the toe box and a bit snug on the top of my foot but so far I've had no issue. Just a feel thing. For the most part I don't notice a thing, which is good! I am a distance runner, logging a lot of miles, and my feet feel really cared for in this shoe. The cushioning is great. I tend to like a minimalist feel but in these I feel pretty good, despite the stiffer shoe and cushioning. I absolutely love this model. I wish there were more neutral colors - kind of sick of the bright bright colors that all shoe makers go with. I love some of the mens colors and wish they'd make similar ones for women.",
120238,2,03/25/2017,"Still on the fence about these The biggest thing I dislike about these shoes is in the inside by the arch there is a hard, pointy piece of plastic. It pokes my foot when I am running - but when I take the shoe off I cant find the pointy piece of whatever it is that is poking me.",
120238,5,03/20/2017,"Best running shoe ever I'll start with the positive - I absolutely love this running shoe.  I've been purchasing the Ravenna for the past 8 years.  Take them out of the box, put them on and go!  No rubbing, chafing, sliding, no breaking them in.  They have a lot of bounce and cushion, and are extremely responsive.  Each version of the shoe gets better and better.  I love the reflective touches they added and the shoe is well constructed.  Now the negative - pink on all three combinations, really?  Not everyone likes the pink/purple combination that manufacturers insist on using for women's athletic merchandise.  This shoe is endorsed by Runners World as a ""best buy"" you would think it would be offered in more than 3 color combinations.  I actually hated the look of these shoes and purchased the Nike running shoe that was endorsed by Runners World.  Unfortunately, it wasn't a good shoe for me and I had to return them.  I begrudgingly purchased the Ravenna in the Navy/Barney Purple/Pink combo.  It took me three months of looking at them on line, hating them, and convincing myself they might look better in person.  Wrong.  Other than they are the ugliest shoe I've ever worn LOL they are the best running shoe ever.  Sorry Brooks, I know you can do better!",
120238,1,03/20/2017,Disappointed I've had Ravennas in the past and loved them. I wore these for two weeks without much issues at the gym and suddenly the top of my left foot felt the discomfort. I had tried relacing them and loosening how I tie my shoes but nothing helped. Then I thought I would just wear it casually to walk around but it would just hurt my foot too much. I'm very disappointed as I love everything else about these shoes,
120238,1,03/18/2017,Why couldn't they just stay with Ravenna 7s? The structure of this revision make my feet fall asleep mid-run.  What a disappointment as I have many many pairs of Ravenna 7s.,
120238,5,02/26/2017,"Great shoe! Great shoe. After they changed the fit of my favorite running shoe, for a couple years I couod not find a shoe that felt right, I finally found a running shoe I feel comfortable again. Fits good in the toe box, often times that part of the shoe is too narrow, but I can't go wide becasue the rest of my foot is too narrow, so this one is just right. And the running shoe stires tell me I am neutral runner, but after trying the neutral shoe, and then coming back to this shoe, I feel I run better in a more stability like shoe, unless I am racing.",
120238,1,02/18/2017,"the 7's are better I love the comfort of the shoe on my heels and in the toe box, where the problem occurs is the logo next to the shoe laces (triangle). It puts a lot of pressure on my  metatarsal and that is all I can can feel while running.  I LOVED the 7's the ones prior to that model as well. Please don't put the logo in a triangle by the shoe laces. Stick with the 7's model while making new colors for each season. I LOVE  Ravenna Brooks and this is the first time, I have been really disappointed the 8's.",
120239,5,12/24/2017,"Very solid shoe for road training runs This is a very stable shoe - I mention this because I have to run on paved trails and roads that often have debris and uneven pavement. While others have twisted ankles, or even broken bones running these routes, I have felt really supported and have had no falls. I did switch to a lighter shoe for a recent 5K and ran a PR. This isn't a fast shoe but great for long runs (lots of cushion) and questionable roads/paths.",
120239,5,12/19/2017,"Love these shoes I had plantar fasciitis for more than a year.  When I tried on the Transcend 4, they were perfect.  I had to buy a size bigger, which is normal for me.  But, they were so comfortable that within a month, I got a new pair to have just in case.  I run in these, do zumba in them, and wear them to the gym and just about everywhere.  So far, my plantar fasciitis hasn't come back!  I recently ordered a pair of the men's Transcend 4 for my son and he loves them as well.  I have had Brooks shoes for 2 years now and unless they get narrow with their toe boxes and lose the cushioning, I am staying with them.",
120239,2,12/09/2017,"Disappointing I bought these at Brooksrunning.com and have worn them about 4 times so far.  I've worn them for work (am on my feet 5 hours a day) and also just for fast-walking.  As ""comfortable"" as they are, I've noticed that my legs and feet get extremely tired in them.  I've worn every Transcend generation and thought they would continually get better.  I have three pairs of the 3rd generation and have rotated them so I can make them last as long as possible, however, they were beginning to wear down.  After wearing the 4th generation to work, I noticed that my feet and weight felt like they didn't have a ton of support - sort of like imy energy was ""spreading"" out.  If I needed a little get up and go to take off on the run, I felt like I couldn't get going.  This is a lot of money to have my body exhausted after wearing them!  Very disappointing.",
120239,5,11/01/2017,"THE BEST......... I originally bought after suffering a major foot injury that required me to wear running shoes 24/7. I had previously worn ASICS and Saucony but these were like heaven for my feet. Supportive, stable and cushion, just what I needed. In the past year I have worn Transcend everyday. I think I am on my 4th pair for this year and just ordered 2 new pairs. They are so supportive and comfortable and work with my orthotics. The good news is my foot is pretty much healed but I still wear my Transcends almost all the time. Thank you Brooks!",
120239,5,10/30/2017,More colors please ,
120239,5,10/25/2017,I have been buying Brooks Transcend for over 10 years I am not a runner; I wear these shoes in my workouts.  They were recommended to me by a friend who ran the Boston Marathon.  The fit is so good that I never have to go into a store.  I just order online every 6 months.,
120239,5,10/10/2017,"Transcend for the WIN! Been running in Transcends since they came out.  It's my ""go-to"" shoe.  Love the cushion and stability without the rigidness.  The blue/ purple/ peacock color is bright and fun without being over the top.",
120239,2,09/29/2017,"Why no lace loops on tongue? I love Transcends, but the Transcend 4s don't have any loops or slots on the tongue to run the laces through, and it drives me crazy!! Within minutes of use, the tongue is already crooked, which I can feel on the top of my foot, so I'm constantly having to stop and pull the tongue straight, and the cycle repeats. I'm debating returning them over this, which is such a shame because they're great otherwise. Such a strange thing to remove from the updated version, PLEASE bring it back in the Transcend 5s!!",
120239,5,09/22/2017,The best shoe! These are the only shoes I wear.  They are so comfortable and i like the lower heel to toe ratio.  I have plantar fascitis and these keep my calfs more stretched out.  I will die if they quit making them!  I bet I have 12 pairs.,
120239,5,09/01/2017,Great Shoes When I first tried these on I was a little skeptical of how it felt. I read all the review ao I considered the shoes. I tend to pronate and I needed shoes that would give me that support. I like the support it gave in my arches as well. It didn't feel flat. Once I went for a run I was amazed on my run time. I kept the same pace all the way around and I cut off 1 minute. Not to mention how comfortable the shoes were. I can feel the difference in the shoes. There was no stress on my shins or knees. The shoes is not heavy. I would definitely recommend these shoes.,
120239,4,08/27/2017,I would buy this shoe again If forefoot cushioning is what you are looking for and an overall good distance shoe i highly recommend this. I replaced my Brooks adrenaline with this and have no regrets,
120239,3,08/21/2017,I have the Navy in 8 1/2. The black in an 81/2 is to small I stand on my feet all day and these shoes were wonderful. I need the black instead of Navy from my work,
120239,4,08/21/2017,"Great shoe, but not the one for me I typically run on an elliptical machine, and occasionally outside in my neighborhood. This shoe works very well for both. It has the most cushioning of any shoe I have ever tried; however, I can feel the top of the shoe on the top of my toes, and I don't like that. This is a great shoe, just not the one for me. I tried two other Brooks' shoes, and ended up keeping the Adrenaline GTS; it's the perfect running shoes for my needs. Brooks is a great company, and their 90 day ""take it for a run"" policy is so helpful and smart. I am now officially a Brooks fan!",
120239,5,08/19/2017,"Comfort of Ghost with even better stability then Ravenna I have been wearing Brooks for decades.  For several years I relied heavily on Ravenna, but my feet suddenly decided I needed more cushion.  I tried Ghost 10  (bliss until I moved), unfortunately I need mild stability. So, I went back to my local running store asking for a shoe which felt like the Ghost with the added stability of the Ravenna.  I tried the new Ravenna 8 (which is a vast improvement over last year's model), but could not compete with the cushioning in the Transcend 4.  I put about 350-400 miles a month on my shoes, and Transcend 4 is my newest favorite.",
120239,2,08/07/2017,"Not true to size. I bought this show in the same size that I have ordered other Brooks brand shoes. As soon as I was able to squeeze my foot into the shoes I knew something wasn't right. The shoes were so tight that I had to check the size label on the shoes. It stated that the shoe was an 11.5, but it felt more like a size 10. They looked nice just didn't fit. I would recommend going a size and a half up.",
120239,5,07/21/2017,This is my second pair of Transcend 4s ,
120239,5,07/19/2017,"No more injuries! Best pair of running shoes I have ever had and I go through a lot of them! I was prone to shin splints and achilles tendonitis - since switching to the Transcend model, with the appropriate support and extremely comfortable foot bed, I have not had a problem with either malady. Wish you made these as a winter runner  as I live in NW Montana and need the Goretex lining you offer in the Ghost and Adrenalin to keep my feet warm and dry during our 9 months of winter.",
120239,5,07/12/2017,"BEST RUNNING SHOES EVER Just a freshman in HS, I was both confused and alarmed when I was sidelined for up to a year at a time with various injuries (heel, knee, hip, balls of the feet). Then these shoes. They are comfortable, stable and very durable. I've run about 300 miles in them and we almost no signs of wear. My injurys have subsided. It was almost to good to be true. Only complains are that they have given me blisters along the guide rail, and are not the best for speed workouts/racing. Nonetheless, I'm very thankful for these shoes!!!! Strongly recommend time anyone with a history of injury or anyone simply looking for a reliable shoe. Many thanks, Brooks!",
120239,5,07/12/2017,"Best Running Shoes I have Owned I'd always had problems. First it was my heel (which sidelined me for over a year), then the soles of my feet, my knees and then the balls of my feet. I found this both frustrating and confusing as I'm a younger runner, just a freshman in HS. Then, these shoes. I've run about 300 miles in them and they show almost no signs of wear. They fit well, are comfortable and have kept me healthy through many, many long distance runs. My complaints would just be that the guard rails have given me blisters, and that these shoes and not my favorite for speed workouts. But overall, wonderful, reliable shoes. Strongly recommend to anyone with an unresolved history of injury or discomfort! Thank you Brooks!!!",
120239,5,06/20/2017,"No more pain!!! Super comfortable, haven't had shin splints or any pain in my feet since running with these!! Wish I knew about him a long time ago!!!! They're a bit expensive so I only use them just to run, I have other Brooks I use day to day.  I'm a Brooks girl all the way!!",
120239,5,06/16/2017,"Highly impressed As I typically prefer neutral, lightweight and flexible, I was worried it would feel too heavy or stiff. Not the case! Perfect for high mileage road running! Even, a neutral runner, like myself.",
120239,4,06/15/2017,"Comfortable The transcend 4 is not as supportive as the same size transcend 3--I tend to pronate more in this shoe than the previous one.  I have added custom inserts, which help, but did not need these in last pair.",
120239,5,06/12/2017,"Love the Transcend... my third pair ,I own several ghost 2 ",
120239,4,06/08/2017,Love Love Love Transcend 4 Standing on my feet giving a client a massage is hard on the body ... quick recovery begins with great footwear.  Brooks is my choice,
120239,2,06/01/2017,"I LOVE the feel, but – I am a casual runner, and have been training for a 10k. I tried these on in my local running shoe store and fell in love with the feel. The cushioning really makes it feel like you are running on a cloud, it's straight up luxurious.. and the arch support felt high/stable enough to help my over pronation. The sales woman even mentioned to me that she didn't have to use her orthotics in these, because they were so supportive.Given that my orthotics are old (7+ years) I decided to do some light training in these without the custom inserts. Big, huge, terrible mistake. These alone are not supportive to those like me... though they felt like they were. It wasn't until my ankle and shin started painfully hurting two weeks into my training in these that I realized there was such a problem. It seems that the lack of support may have led to a PTTD problem, which all comes back to straining the tendons that hold up my arch in these shoes.Would highly not recommend if you need stability or arch support, otherwise they are perfect.",
120239,5,05/25/2017,"Very comfortable run I ran in the Adrenaline for 12+ years and loved them.  I decided to take a chance a couple of years ago on the Transcend and have no regrets.  They are a softer run and work great with my orthotics.  For now, I am sticking with the Transcend.",
120239,2,05/22/2017,"Expensive blisters I loved the Trance and Transcend 1 & 2.  However the uppers of the Transcend 3 & 4 do not seem to have adequate reinforcement.  In both the 3 and 4 models the inside big-toe area of the uppers collapse after a few runs, creating creases in the uppers.  Those creases are like vice-grips, compressing the skin on the inside edge of the base of my big toes, causing painful blood blisters.    This is unfortunate, because the cushioning otherwise makes for a very comfortable pair of running shoes.    The perfect Brooks shoe for me would be a marriage between the soles of the Transcends with the uppers of the Adrenalines.",
120239,5,04/23/2017,I will buy this shoe again. ,
120239,5,04/15/2017,"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOES!! I am in love with this shoes, I am flat footed with an average arch. I used HOKA but its giving me shin splints, bought this yesterday tried running on the treadmill with it. It is amazing and am not hurting! Finally I have a pair of shoes that is comfortable for both short and long runs!",
120239,5,04/06/2017,"Love. These. Shoes. Loved the Transcend 1, was NOT a fan of Transcend 2 or 3, but these have redeemed the Transcends for me!  The cushioning is exceptional....I am in love with these and buying a 2nd pair.  I hope Brooks doesn't try to 'over-fix' this style like they did with the 2-3.  Seriously.....best....shoe....ever.",
120239,5,04/02/2017,Love these shoes! Lighter weight than previous Transcends. Very comfortable! I'm considering buying a 2nd pair.,
120239,4,03/31/2017,"Good shoe. So far so good. My daughter is pleased, the only thing is that she was bummed about was when the free socks weren't included in the order.",
120239,3,03/31/2017,Not What I Expected I ordered the Transcend thinking it would have more cushion and support than the Adrenaline GTS. It had more cushion but not support. I put on one Transcend and one of my old Adrenaline's and I could tell a huge difference in the support of my over pronation. I could actually see my ankle turn in with the Transcend but not with the Adrenaline. I returned the Transcend's and ordered a new pair of the Adrenaline GTS. The Transcend would probably be a good shoe for someone who does not need support for over/under pronation.,
120239,5,03/31/2017,Hands down the best shoe that I have ever owned! ,
120239,2,03/28/2017,"Developed metatarsal pain after wearing twice These shoes feel amazing when you put them on and my knee pain that I experienced before is completely gone... However after 2 runs with these shoes and wearing them for walks, my left foot especially has unbearable metatarsal pain.  I was really hoping to love these shoes and I'm so sad that I'll have to return my Transcend 4's.  I still stand by Brooks as a brand and will likely be trading the Transcend's in for different Brook's shoes.  Also, I feel as though it's important to note that I haven't ever worn a wide shoe but these shoes do feel very narrow.",
120239,5,03/19/2017,Godd running ahoes ,
120239,4,03/19/2017,Good running shows ,
120239,5,03/18/2017,"Finally I found my shoe! These were the first shoes I bought online so I was skeptical that they would work out, even after filling out the right fit shoe quiz. I am an avid Brooks fan- these are my 4th pair in 2 years. I am on my feet for 12 hours a night as a NICU nurse and my feet take a beating. These shoes are supportive and make me feel like I am floating, walking on clouds. I wish there were more colors, that is my only complaint. I highly recommend these shoes. Also, on a side note, I contacted customer service and they were very helpful!",
120239,1,03/10/2017,"Very disappointed I bought the Transcend 3 last year and loved them! Needed a new pair so obviously bought the Transcend 4....my feet have killed me all week. It's like I'm walking on a flat hard surface with no shoe. What happened? I have fallen arches and have spent a fortune on shoes and such. Please bring back the Transcend that helped me so much before. If not,I'll have to explore another brand:(",
120239,1,03/09/2017,I would not buy this product again I loved my Transcend 3. I wore them every day to work. I have fallen arches and sometime have horrible pain. The Transcend 4 actually hurt me feet. Really disappointed.,
120239,5,03/08/2017,I love these shoes! These are the most comfortable running shoes!  They have a good amount of support and are very lightweight.  I was able to run a long run right out of the box!  I highly recommend these shoes!,
120239,5,01/29/2017,"Vast improved over Transcend 3 I walked my first half-marathon last spring (doing 15min/mile) and am training for another this year (already at sub 13min/mile), so I'm not a runner, but do put a good deal of use on my shoes.  I used the Ravenna 7 last year, but it didn't have enough cushioning for me once I reached walks longer than about 8 miles.  I switched to the Transcend 3 because they were more comfortable for longer distances.  They worked better for me overall, but I never really loved them.  I bought the new Transcend 4 as soon as it was released and am much, much happier with the 4 than the 3 (have already purchased in both colors and hoping for more...a nice black that I could wear to work would be fantastic).  There's no major overhaul on the shoe, just minor tweaks here and there that overall make it fit better and look nicer.  The tongue is less stiff on the 4 than the 3, and the outer wedge of the outside of the heel is not as dramatically chunked out on the 4 as it was on the 3.  It looks less boxy, but still feels suitably roomy.  Considering the price, though, I'd still like to see Brooks add a lace holder on the tongue (like the Ravenna) and use the round, stretchier laces also like the Ravenna.",
120239,5,01/21/2017,"Love this sneaker If you liked the Transcend 1and 2, but did not like the 3's. You will love these.  These shoes have a lot of cushion, light and the toe box is spacious. You feel like your walking on springs.  I am disappointed that they don't have more colors. I have the dark blue ones and plan to buy the turquoise/light blue ones, but would really love it if they came in pink. I do a lot of walking and usually need new sneakers ever 6 months.  Give them a try, you will not be disappointed.",
120239,2,01/17/2017,"Not as happy with Transcend 4 as I was with the Transcend 3 I was counting the days down to get my hands on the Transcend 4 only to be disappointed with the way the new design fits my feet.  Just looking at it the shoe, it looks great. BUT, the new design does NOT give me the stability and support I need for my overpronation. The design would work great for one that needs a shoe for underpronation.  I have owned four pairs of the Transcend style shoe, two of the 2s and two of the 3s.  The 3s are my favorite.  I hope Brooks makes some changes to the 4 or the 5 for next year so that I can wear them again.  I might have to try the Ariel this year to help with my overpronation.  I am sorry to say that I will have to return my Transcend 4.  I really wanted the new design to work for me.",
120239,5,01/15/2017,"Great Shoe I'm comparing this shoe to the TRANSCEND 3 when I say it's slightly narrower in the toe box and fractionally  smaller in size. These differences are changes I actually prefer, which is why I gave it 5*. Just ran 5 miles and noticed that they made the 4's lighter and somehow delivered more cushion! Now if Brooks would only offer these at a lower price, I'd buy two!",
120243,5,12/21/2017,Great shoes!  Would buy this again. Great fitting shoe! I'm a nurse on my feel for hours during the day and my feet still feel great when i get home.,

120243,3,12/07/2017,"Wish they had a wide size (in any trail shoe) This is the trail model of the road shoe I run in, so I think I would have loved them if only they came in wide sizes. There isn't a single trail shoe available in wide!",
120243,4,11/09/2017,Great trail running shoes These shoes are great. Enough support I don't have to put an insert in but not heavy. I mostly use them to run on hilly trails and I've had no issues. I always love Brooks shoes. Enjoy!,
120243,5,09/17/2017,"Sixth pair of adrenalines Brooks adrenalines have never failed me; I've been running in them for 15 years without an injury.  I do buy a full size larger than my street shoe size.  This version is a vivid eye-pleasing color combination, and not too garish.  I was sorry not to find the trail-running version on your website, I guess they are discontinued, those were great.",
120243,5,09/05/2017,Brooks Adrenaline ASR - love them! I have been running in the Brooks   Adrenaline ASR as my go to trail training shoe for years - these are the best yet!  I love them!,

120243,5,08/29/2017,Recommend for wider feet ,
120243,5,08/27/2017,cushioned! great shoe.  i'm a little overweight and have shin splints.  I was looking for a shoe with extra cushion and these are amazing.,
120243,5,07/28/2017,Amazing Amazing! I have  Planter Fasciitis. The new ASR 14 have a softer insole then the 13. They appear to look more like their sister shoe Adrenaline GTS. Which provides a wider toe base.  They provide a great stable support for my feet. My feet tend to have a natural supination. My husband surprised me with the 14 for preparation of our Disney Trip. I figured I'd take them as a back up shoe however now they moved to the front of the line.,
120245,5,12/17/2017,great shoe I used these shoes to travel abroad. They were super comfortable to walk all day in. I also use them to run. I think they are great because they are waterproof.,
120245,5,12/17/2017,Winter shoe love! Ghost 10 is my go to shoe...can't express how excited I was to try the gore-tex version..3 days in a row of feels like 15 degrees in NYC in these shoes with a thin wool sock proved to me that this Ghost once again did not disappoint..worth every penny..,
120245,5,12/08/2017,Recommended Brooks Running Shoes Great waterproof shoe for wet PNW winters. I purchased the Ghost 9 before and it was the only shoe I've had that didn't leave me with blisters. I contacted Brooks staff via email because I was running into the rainy season and they told me about these shoes. I have ran approx 10 times in them already. I love the Brooks Ghost style and won't use anything else for running!,
120245,3,11/29/2017,Rain and Width Rain still runs down your legs into socks and feet get wet. No wide width is a no go for me.,
120245,5,11/20/2017,"I have bought this product for at least 5 yrs. I use the shoe for off trail hiking, walking in snow, and in the rain. The shoe works for all terrain walking.",
120245,5,10/31/2017,Super comfy! I bought them for walking in the rain and my feet stay dry! I had to buy a 1/2 size bigger but they fit fantastic! They also do not need to be worn in like my previous pairs of Adrenelins.,
120245,4,10/31/2017,"Amazing for a few weeks and now great for a 6-8hrs 12hr shift nursing and first responder, standing and walking with occasional running for 12hrs at a time.",
120245,5,10/26/2017,"Dry happy feet Ready to try these in the rain and snow. They fit just like the traditional Ghost, which is my favorite Brooks shoe and running shoe overall. Really happy to have these for the winter season :) #reviewsweeps",
120245,5,10/24/2017,"Can't wait to try these on a slushy day No more rain or snow to ruin my plans for a run! Fit great, hopefully a water resistant version of my favorite shoe for nearly 10 years",
120245,5,10/14/2017,"LOVE THEM! Just like any other Brooks running gear I've bought, these shoes didn't disappoint! Super comfortable from first use, I wore them for a 10-mile street run and felt like I was running on clouds. Just love them!",
120245,5,10/14/2017,"LOVE THEM! Like every piece of running gear from Brooks, this shoes didn't disappoint! Super comfortable from first use (10-mile street run).  I have been wearing them for three weeks and I honestly don't even want to use any other pair of running shoes I own.",
120245,4,09/20/2017,"Attractive and comfortable! I use the shoes on mostly moderately technical trails and some roads. They have held up in thunderstorms and mud puddles. The only drawback is that they can feel a little bulky and almost over cushioned, but I would buy them again.",
120245,5,09/20/2017,"Love them! Hiked Pikes Peak wearing these shoes and amazingly forgot I even had anything on my feet. I have a hard time finding a good running/hiking shoe but these are awesome! No blisters, no rubbing, no slipping. So very comfortable.",
120245,3,08/28/2017,"Prefer the ghost 9 Feels stiffer than my ghost 9, arches of my feet get a bit sore and that has never happened with my previous ghost shoes.",
120246,5,12/27/2017,I'd buy this again and again The shoe is extremely comfortable running or just walking. Definitely recommend this fit,
120246,5,12/27/2017,"The best!! I work in a hospital and am constantly walking from floor to floor, so I need some shoes that are comfortable and supportive. These are absolutely that! I've never had more comfortable shoes than brooks brand tennis shoes. I can see a huge difference with how my feet feel at the end of the day after switching to these!!!",
120246,4,12/27/2017,"Great running shoe! I've been running in these shoes for a couple of weeks now,  andI love running them-- plenty of cushion without losing any spring/responsiveness. The only con is the lining around the ankle already had a hole wearing in it.",
120246,5,12/27/2017,Perfect fit! ,
120246,5,12/27/2017,The Ghost is exytremely comfortable and support a high arch I mostly walk and have a hard time finding shoes to support my wide foot and high arch. The Ghost fits and feels great!,
120246,5,12/26/2017,Most comfortable running shoes I've even owed ,
120246,4,12/26/2017,"Love Ghost, but... I have been purchasing the Ghost for awhile, size 71/2 without sizing issues. This new version has a much wider toebox and it is a little longer, so I have had to go one size smaller. I actually returned the 71/2, and ordered the 7. It seems to fit fine, but I won't know until I take it for a run. I was actually tripping in the 71/2. When I put my last year's Ghost and the new Ghost side by side, the newer long is definitely longer. Dear Brooks, please don't mess with the sizing, thanks.",
120246,5,12/23/2017,Great comfort for running Comfortable for running. I have worn Ghosts for 2 years. This is my third pair.,
120246,5,12/22/2017,"Ghost 10 Initially I bought two pairs of Brooks: Adrenaline GTS 17 and Ghost 10. I had to return Adrenaline because they made my feet hurt by the end of 8hrs shift. I love Ghost 10 because they give me support and stability and my knees and hips are not aching as they used to.. I bought also a pair of Ghost 10 for my husband but he is not ""in love"" with the shoes...As you can see, the same shoes could be comfortable for one person and not really comfortable for another.  I highly recommend Brooks. The only word of advise is-go to the store and try them out and see which ones suits you to save the hustle of returning them back. And also, don't buy them as a present for someone unless you know the model they like.GOOD LUCK!",
120246,5,12/21/2017,"My Go-To Shoe I previously owned the Ghost 9, tried the Adrenaline 18, but then ultimately returned that pair and ordered the Ghost 10.  The Ghost 10 does feel a little softer and more flexible than the 9, which is a nice improvement.  The upper is also a little more pliable, which means that I tend to have to be just a little more careful when lacing them than I did with my 9s.  I chose the 422 color, Hawaiian Surf/Evening Blue/Sunny Lime.  For some reason they photograph as a bright blue, but there is just a hint of teal to them when you look at the shoes in person.  I wore my Ghost 10s for my recent half marathon and was happy every step of the way.  The Adrenaline 18 did seem to aggravate my shin splits and I have not had the same problem with the Ghost 10.",
120246,5,12/20/2017,I'd by these shoes again in a heartbeat! ! I've had previous models of Ghost shoes but these are the most comfortable. Lots of cushioning and a wide toe box make these great walking shoes for me. They look as sharp as they feel. I need not look any further to find the ideal shoes for my feet!,
120246,2,12/19/2017,I would not buy this shoe again ,
120246,5,12/19/2017,"The Cadillac of Shoes! I'm recovering from plantar fasciitis and was looking for a comfortable shoe now that I am back walking in races. These fit good and were comfortable right out of the box. I also use an over the counter insole. My feet felt good after a half marathon. I now own 4 pair of these, 2 for races and 2 pair for go to everyday shoes. I'm very grateful for these shoes.",
120246,5,12/18/2017,buying again ,
120246,5,12/17/2017,"Very comfortable! I needed a comfortable shoe for walking all day in a dental office (in a 'professional neutral ' color). Our local running shoe store had several Brooks in my BIG feet size. They special ordered the grey/pink for me. So glad I found Ghost 10! Cushy, room for end of day puffy toes. Arch support without being stiff.",
120246,5,12/16/2017,"Love This shoe is VERY comfortable. It has the perfect support and structure and I feel like my feet are stable (no turning inward or raised heel). I have a wide foot and the ""wide"" width size fit wonderfully. Never had to go through any of the usual ""breaking it in"" pain and suffering. Very happy with this shoe. Would definitely order it again.",

Know my feet will feel great. My daughter and her family run marathons and they turned me onto Brooks. Glad they did. Love my Ghost 10s.",
120246,5,12/13/2017,"So COMFY!! The heel is a LOT more cushioned than the toe. But the ball of the foot is very well cushioned and I think that is really great for the way that I run. I also really like these for walking on the treadmill because it gives more support. But you can grip the ground well when you're running, a pretty natural but supported feel, I think. They were a little hard to break in because they irritated the back of my heel, but I only wear really low socks so that one was on me, just a warning!",
120246,5,12/12/2017,"exxcellent quality and fit I'd bought Asics shoes for years, but when they changed their sizing, the toe box was too narrow for me.  I decided to try the Ghost 10, based on the sizing reviews, and it fits perfectly.  Will continue to buy this brand and model as long as Brooks stays with this true-to-fit sizing.  Also was happy to find a shoe in a color that goes with everything.",
120246,5,12/12/2017,The Best Running Shoe ever! I run 3-4 miles about 3-4 times a week and LIVE these shoes. I have worn Ravennas for the last couple years and have to say the Ghost 10 is now my favorite shoe.,
120246,5,12/07/2017,LOVE the fit and feel! ,
120246,5,12/07/2017,This a great sneaker! I took a chance and bought the ghost. When I first bought brooks I started with the ghost. They were so comfortable. Then they made changes to them and the ghost lost me. I have bought adrenalines and glycerines since! Guys my ghosts are back and better than before!! They were comfortable right out of the box!,
120246,5,12/07/2017,Best shoe ever owned I had severe plantar fasciitis.  Bought this shoe as I walk around a hospital all day long.  Very comfortable and I am pain free!  Tempted to buy several pairs so I will have them forever.  Literally best shoe I have ever worn.,
120246,5,12/06/2017,"These shoes are amazing!! I'm on my feet 12 to 14 hours a day at work. These shoes are fairly lightweight but provide tremendous support and comfort to my feet! If you have sore feet and you need a shoe that lessens the impact on your feet,  this is the shoe for you!",
120246,5,12/06/2017,"Love, love, love my new Brooks! After being diagnosed with both a bone spur and plantar fasciitis, I thought I would never own a comfortable pair of shoes again. My local specialty shoe store recommended Brooks Ghost. They were spot on, 2 years later, I only buy Brooks Ghost for my athletic shoes. Ghost 10 are great and I love not only the comfort and painless walks I can now take again, but am absolutely in love with the color! Great design inside and out.",
120246,5,12/06/2017,Best Ghost yet ,
120246,4,12/06/2017,I love the ghost style I have purchased this style for the past 3 years. This version is narrower in the width and especially in the toe box.,
120246,1,12/05/2017,"Very soft in the heels and caused knee pain These are very soft in the heel and are comfortable initially.  But, after walking around my work for a couple days (a small office) I've had severe knee pain for weeks after I stopped wearing them.  I've worn the Ghost 7 for years... I loved them so much I bought 3 pairs.  The 10 is not supportive at all.  Looks like I'll be trying to find some Ghost 9's and hope they work.",
120246,5,12/05/2017,Just wish that I could get narrow sizes more easily I live in these shoes.  Brooks is the only place that I can get narrow athletic shoes.,
120246,4,12/05/2017,"The Knit Keeps Things Warm I love the design and the look. Just like any other Ghost - great quality. I was not expected how warm the toebox gets when running from, I assume, the knit design of the shoe. But....I'll just wear them in the cold months to run and feel all warm and toasty! Love them!!",
120246,5,12/05/2017,"Best yet! I am a causal runner, logging 3-5 miles 3-4 days a week for the most part, but will amp up the mileage while training for half marathons. This is now my 4th pair of Brooks Ghost and I can easily say these are the most comfortable yet.",
120246,5,12/04/2017,"LOVE! This is my first pair of Brooks Ghost running shoes and I love them! They are extremely comfortable, my custom made orthotics fit in them well, and are very versatile for running and walking. I have worn Brooks Adrenaline for years, which are also very comfortable but I tend to have a lot of heel movement. Will absolutely purchase another pair!",
120246,4,12/04/2017,Decent shoe On my feet a lot at work and this shoe does ok. It seems to already be wearing through the cushion at back of heel. Not as sturdy as other shoes I've tried,
120246,3,12/04/2017,"I need more cushioning in the ball of my foot. I use it to run in, and am heavier with a high arch.  My foot is difficult to fit, and I was hoping that this would be the shoe.....its not.  But it's better than some shoes I've had, so thumb's up on that one.",
120246,1,12/03/2017,I'm not sure This is my 5th pair of Brooks Ghost. The last 4 I loved. This pair is causing so much pain in the bottom part underneath the front of my feet and toes that i literally limp around after I take them off. I'm not sure if they have been redesigned or what. I don't think I can exchange them as the pain was not immediate and now I have worn them outside. I am so bummed and would be afraid to buy again.,
120246,5,12/03/2017,"So PRETTY!!! I've worn the Ghost for years and always loved them, but I was gleeful when I opened this box because they are gorgeous!! I feel like the ride on the 10 is smoother with a more natural feeling transition than the 9 (burned out 2 pair of 9s last year). I had tried to move to the Glycerin but after 100 miles I knew I need my Ghost back.",
120246,5,12/02/2017,"The Best!!!!!!! I am in love with this shoes, my 4-5 mile run daily feels like very comfortable. I don't have pain or soreness. Love, love. love these.",
120246,5,12/02/2017,This particular shoe color was big I have two pairs of the ghost 10 and they are amazing. I bought the all mesh color and they were huge. Easy to return and am now trying glycerin 14. Still a huge fan of the ghost,
120246,5,12/01/2017,"I buy this product over and over! I love love love these shoes! I had back surgery a year ago, so I walk every day.  These shoes give me the comfort and support that I look for in a shoe.  I also am a teacher and have another pair to teach in.  Great shoes!",
120246,5,12/01/2017,"Great shoe for walking I bought this to supplement my current walking shoe inventory :). I walk 4 miles every morning, so comfort and support is key. This show has both. Plus very cute.",
120246,5,11/30/2017,"Super cushion-y! These are the most comfortable running shoes I have ever owned! Very cushioned if you need the extra support! (Just a side note, the color is not rose gold. It looks exactly as the picture but the description should be more of a metallic pastel pink than rose gold.)",
120246,2,11/30/2017,Soles are falling apart They are great shoes but the rubber is coming off the bottom in less then a month.My wife only wears them to the gym an hour a day 4 times a week. They just don't seem to hold up like the older models. Me and my wife have been wearing ghost since the 3rd gen and i am in 9s now and the quality is just not there any more. I like the shoes but I don't think they are worth the 120 since I'm having to buy a new pair every 2 to 3 months.,
120246,5,11/30/2017,No better shoe than this! This is my third pair of brooks! I've loved them all but they keep getting better! Wore these for my first half marathon and they were phenomenal! My feet never hurt! I order a half size to whole size bigger for long distance running and they still were perfect! Well worth your money!,
120246,5,11/30/2017,"Goldilox says JUST RIGHT!!!! I read the reviews before I ordered these shoes and these are perfect.  Perfect fit, perfection in comfort; in fact the extra padding under the ball of the foot is the selling point of these shoes.  The toe box has plenty of room to wiggle toes and the fit, I can't say it enough is perfect.  This is my go to shoe from now on...",
120246,5,11/29/2017,"Favorite Shoes! These shoes fit great from the moment I put them on. I have a wide foot and finding the right pair of shoes is extremely challenging, but the Brooks Ghost are incredible!",
120246,4,11/25/2017,Comfortable Forefoot I love the wide toe box in this shoe but I think it needs a sturdier heel.  More support is needed in the heel with a possible curved insole to relieve pressure on the heel.,
120246,5,11/25/2017,Great shoe I've been wearing the same model/generation Nike for the last 3 pairs of running shoes because every shoe I've tried feels too narrow near the toe box. Finally I decided to try the Ghost 10 and have had great results. Plenty of room and no more pain running from my feet being squeezed. I feel they're true to size as well. So far I've only used them on my regular 6 mile runs but they seem like they'll be perfect for my long distance runs as well.,
120246,5,11/25/2017,"Very comfortable running shoe! I previously purchased the Launch running shoe and it was horrible on my foot. I had to go into a shoe store to be tested and I tried the Glycerin, Saucony, and these. I instantly went with these! I could tell the comfort level for my foot was right there! I didn't have to guess between any of these other versions. I am very happy with my shoe purchase!",
120246,5,11/23/2017,Feel like clouds...amazing for 5km runs I run 5km to 10km ...2 or 3x per week.  I have the launch and thought i would try these too.  They have a bit more cushion but they performed well during run.  I never contemplated brooks before and wow ... I am sold on them.  I was surprised at how wide the toe box was...as i typically like my toes feeling snug but this did not hinder my run.  Very comfy shoes just to wear for casual.,
120246,5,11/22/2017,"LOVE THE GHOST! I absolutely love this shoe! I've been buying the Ghost over and over again since I first started running in them about 5 years ago. The 10 doesn't disappoint of course, and I love the Limited Edition purple color!",
120246,5,11/21/2017,"Seriously GREAT shoe! I never run without these shoes.  The high arch support is just what i need.  I ran a half and they did me good.  :) I'll be shopping for a second pair very soon.  Sometimes my ankle will give me trouble. When it does, I wear my Brooks and it relieves a lot of stress on my ankle. Double win!",
120246,5,11/20/2017,"my Brroks shoes, Ghost 19 these are very nice shoes. I have a lot of foot issues so nothing is really comfortable for me, but these are the best i have found as far a cushion",
120246,5,11/20/2017,"Best shoes ever! I have severe arthritis in my feet/ankles and wear orthotics.  Dr recommended Brooks shoes. Started out with Ravennas but when new ones came out they didnt fit the same. With the Ghost, each updated version still fits great and is very comfortable...Wish they came in white tho!",
120246,5,11/20/2017,Wide size is perfect I where is steel toed shoes at work. It is wonderful to wear these after work.,
120246,5,11/19/2017,"LOVE!!! You can definitely feel the plushness of this shoes when you put them on. They are more comfortable when I focus on a rearfoot strike. I think they could use just a tad more cushioning for the forefoot strike. Overall, they still feel really good.",
120246,2,11/19/2017,I wouldn't buy the Ghost 10s again I got these after I had the Ghost 9s because of having foot problems and I feel the 9s are more supportive and more comfortable. I never had any pain with the 9s and now I have to buy the 9s again because the 10s just aren't as supportive. I am on my feet all day at work and need good shoes.,
120246,2,11/19/2017,"Disappointed This feels nothing like Ghost 9.  It's too large and squishy and my ankles feel unstable.  The Ghost 9 had more reflective material, which is important for those of us who run in the pre-dawn hours.   Also, the style I bought (purple & white) has gold tips on the shoelaces which are heavier than normal laces and slap against your feet while running- annoying.  And, no, I don't want to spend an additional $30 to try Levitate.",
120246,5,11/19/2017,"THE only shoe I buy When I was able to run, Brooks Ghost go the distance. I've never had any foot issues with this shoe. The laces always stay tied with is a huge issue with other brands with me. The shoe stands up and goes the distance. Now I'm a walker, and I still use the ghost shoe. You get what you pay for the Brooks shoes will be the shoe you will always buy.",
120246,5,11/18/2017,Great shoe.  Ghost runner for life! ,
120246,5,11/16/2017,"Still the best shoe ever! i always buy the Ghost series and they never disappoint. My old ones had put on the miles and it was time to replace them. First day out in my new ones, they were as great as ever.",
120246,5,11/15/2017,"She loves them! I got my mother theses An she basically lives in them. She has a high arches it, An her feet hurt her a lot. She said she hasn't ever had a shoe that feels this nice an well made.",

120246,5,11/14/2017,"Love my ghost 10's I finally found brooks after quite the search to stop my foot pain from old other brand worn out shoes.  (P facitis, h spurs, ankle pain, supinate)  I was a new customer at 10's and I just adore them.  I do alternate w/ gts 17's depending on what my feet need for the day.  The ghosts have strong arch and are so soft and flexible they are fabulous for end of day around house and eve walk.  If I was on my feet all day I may try them too.   the outside heel embellishment is peeling and started a month in but oh well, theyre so comfortable Im ignoring it LOL, not my usual way, but I love these shoes.  If they change them much next year I may have a good cry LOL.  Will prob buy a second pair as I did w/ my gts 17 brooks.  Just in case they change them too much.",
120246,5,11/12/2017,Feels like walking on a cloud I have major walking issues due to various injuries but these shoes make me want to walk. Love them,
120246,5,11/12/2017,"Go to Running Shoe The only shoe I use for running. I run distances anywhere between 5k's to Marathons, mainly on road surfaces, treadmill, and packed gravel trails. My prescription orthotics fit perfectly in the shoes. During th winter I do need to add extra socks or switch over to the GTX version. The only complaint is that the fabric at the top near the ankle is not very durable. I must have kicked myself running and cut a whole in the fabric. However, this does not deter me from continuing to buy ghosts.",
120246,4,11/12/2017,Very comfortable! Had a pair of 9's. Initially they were stiff and uncomfortable. Felt floppy and I had to buy insoles. The 10's have incredibly soft foam gel around the toungue area and overall felt immediately ready for long mileage. The sole felt more flexible and cushioned in comparison as well.,
120246,5,11/11/2017,Finally! ,
120246,5,11/09/2017,The best shoes ever!!!! I am on my feet for 10hours for 8 days in a row.  People that stand on your feet for long periods of time. These are the shoes for you. They are the Bomb!!!!!,
120246,5,11/09/2017,"Love these Brooks! I'm a daily walker with sore feet.  I tried these Brooks Ghost 10 shoes and my feet are SO much better.  I have heel spurs and arthritis in my toes and I was thinking I was going to have to give up my walks for some other kind of exercise, but after wearing these shoes, my heels aren't hurting and even arthritis isn't as painful.  There's a lot of cushion in this shoe.  Also, the top lace area doesn't cut into the top of my foot.  Great design.  I did size up 1/2 size from my usual (usually wear a 9.5, but the size 10 was perfect).  I loved these so much, I now have 2 pair!",
120246,5,11/08/2017,Great shoes! No negatives with this shoe. Walk two to three miles everyday and love these shoes.,
120246,5,11/07/2017,"I would absolutely buy this product again! This shoe in particular feels very comfortable. I run cross country so it's important that my shoe fits perfectly! I'm experiencing No rubbing, no irritations whatsoever going up and down hills.",
120246,5,11/07/2017,"YES!! Welcome Back Ghost 10!! Thank you, thank you, thank you for making these the #1 running shoe in my closet. Went through a couple versions that were not this comfortable. Now I feel like I'm running on a cloud and it makes me want to run again, knowing I will be in these shoes. I can't tell you how much I love them.  Paired with a great Aaptiv running workout, these shoes are a must get. For me.",

120246,5,11/07/2017,Perfect! These shoes offer more cushion than I was expecting but I like it.  They are stable and provide great support.,
120246,5,11/07/2017,"The perfect shoe for long shifts I'm a nurse and stand for twelve hours straight when I work. These shoes are amazing. I've tried so many shoes, including expensive clogs, and none of them come close to my ghosts. The heel is really cushy, which I've never felt before in a sneaker; they're almost bouncy. They give me the arch support I need without being harsh. The colors are cute and my coworkers compliment me often! When I get paid next, I'm going to buy another pair!",
120246,5,11/06/2017,Comfy and cushy ,
120246,5,11/06/2017,"My go to shoe Fits great, feels light but supportive, has good stability without being bulky.",
120246,5,11/06/2017,YES! Buying again. First time runner here. These shoes have helped me go from a 0 miles/week to a half marathon. So comfy. No issues whatsoever. I am buying my second pair now!,
120246,5,11/06/2017,Great running shoe I️ need a narrow running shoe!  This one is the best! Need to go up a half size from normal running shoes. Switched my best friend to them as well!,
120246,5,11/06/2017,Very comfortable shoes I switched from another brand of running shoes and so happy I did. Love these shoes.,
120246,5,11/05/2017,"Ghost 10 I got these shoes on the recommendation of a coworker (RN here).  I have never found sneakers that are comfortable enough to wear for 12+ hours.  The amazing money back guarantee was a huge help.  Well, 3 weeks in --- 6 days a week ---12+ hours a day and I love them!!! No back aches, no foot aches, no discomfort.  Will def have to get another pair, and recommend them to anyone looking for a comfy shoe to stand in all day long!!!",
120246,5,11/05/2017,"Am going to buy a second pair! #ReviewSweepsBest thing about these running shoes is the ample toe box and sufficient arch support.  When I find a running shoe that feels good on, feels good running and provides excellent support I have found a winner!And I like that it is available in several colors from which to choose as everyone's taste is different.",
120246,4,11/05/2017,"Not as cushioned as I hoped, but OK I walk a lot every day, and usually purchase the Adrenaline style. However, I wanted a wide width this time, so ""Ghost"" is what was available. The shoe is comfortable overall, but not nearly as cushioned in the footbed as the Adrenaline. I put in an insert and that really helps.",
120246,5,11/05/2017,Love the shoe! So comfy. Perfect blend of cushion & support ,
120246,5,11/04/2017,I really like these shoes ,
120246,5,11/04/2017,I think these shoes are great ,
120246,5,11/04/2017,Love it! I love the fact that it's so lightweight. However I still have to put my own inserts in as my arches are very very high.,
120246,5,11/03/2017,The best shoe! I bought Brooks shoes for the first time. I put them on the next day and my feet didn't hurt for once. They're the best shoe I have ever had!,
120246,2,11/03/2017,"Great colors, soft but not happy run, too high heel pushes Not happy running, really bummed!  Pretty and cool colors.  But heel too high pushes my foot forward and there's not enough cushion on the forefoot.  The stretch overlay not supportive enough.  My Brooks Glycerin 12's still my all time fav.  But all 3 pairs are worn out and I'm trying to find the right running shoe.",
120246,5,11/03/2017,No shin pain! I bought these sneakers because I read they were good for shin pain. I will never go back to Mizuno's after running in my brooks- my shin pain is completely gone! I definitely feel as though more shock is absorbed in these sneakers.,
120246,5,11/03/2017,"Love, Love, Love! These are probably my favorite brooks so far!  The colors are great and I feel like I'm on a cloud.  I ordered them a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and they are perfect!",
120246,5,11/03/2017,I am planning to buy another pair this week. These are the most comfortable Brooks I've worn to date!  Well worth the price. Amazing fit!,
120246,5,11/02/2017,"I love my Brooks! I use these shoes to work out in. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes seems to help quite a bit. they are cushioned enough and have nice support. The only downfall, and it was my choice, was the color I choose.",
120246,5,11/02/2017,Couldn't get by without my Brooks! Am a physician and on my feet in the clinic/hospital/OR 12-18 hrs/day...Brooks are my go to shoe. I'm impressed by how Ghost has helped keep my plantar fasciitis controlled.,
120246,5,11/01/2017,Most comfortable shoe ever! I am a nursing student and needed a good comfortable pair of shoes. I wish I hadn't waited so long to order these because they are awesome! I can now complete my 12 hour clinical days without aching feet. I just ordered a pair of ghosts for my husband as well. Great purchase and totally worth the price! Thanks Brooks 😊,
120246,5,11/01/2017,Very pleased with my new Brooks shoes. Would buy again. So happy to find a great shoe that fits.  It is so hard to find half sizes once you reach 10s.  My new Brooks are the best.  I work out with a trainer 3 times a week and these Brooks are just what I needed.  They are comfortable and give plenty of support.  Just the right size.  #ReviewSweeps.,
120246,5,10/31/2017,"I think it's love.... I average 11-20 miles/week depending on my work schedule and was looking for a really comfortable, cushioned shoe to get me through my runs. The Ghost 10 is perfect! The toe box is wide enough to provide comfort but not so wide that you're swimming in the shoe. I love to color scheme too :)",
120246,5,10/31/2017,Awesome running ahoes I bought these shoes for my Orangetheory workouts. They are the best things I've ever put on my feet. So comfortable and make my workouts not so hard!!,

120246,3,10/30/2017,"Hurting and going back to Transcend I bought the Ghost 10 after using your shoe selector guide in search of a shoe to replace my Transcend 4's which you are out in my size - everyone is! I tend to under pronate and have had achilles tendinitis in the past. The Transcend's alleviated any pain I had and I never had an injury in them although I did tend to wear the outside edges of the sole down extremely fast. I purchased the Ghost 10's a month ago. Run about 9 miles a day.  While they are very comfortable, my ankles and arch are killing me. Sad to say that this month old pair of shoes is being relegated to the walking pile and I am searching for my old friend the Transcend anywhere I can possible find it. These seem to be a great shoe - well constructed and extremely comfortable for walking but they don't work for me as a serious running shoe.",
120246,5,10/30/2017,The most comfortable running shoes I have ever owned!! ,
120246,5,10/30/2017,"THE BEST running shoes ever created I have been running for years.  I've done several races, from 5K all the way to marathons.  In all the years that I have been running, I was always recommended to use a different brand of shoe (ASICS) and had always stuck with that brand.  The last 3 pairs of ASICS always hurt my feet-like to the point I had to stop running wherever I was, take my shoes off, and rub my feet out.  Sometimes I would literally just take them off the last half mile and walk barefoot back to my house.  I tried EVERYTHING-orthotics, chiropractor, foam rolling my feet, I even put straight lidocaine on my feet to try and numb them!  Nothing worked.  It was awful and I had gotten to the point where I thought I would have to give up running because my feet hurt so much all the time during a run.  Disheartening is not a strong enough word to describe how I felt.  I decided to sign up for one ""last race"" and just told myself I could push through it no matter how much it hurt.  Well, any new training needs a new pair of shoes, so off to the running store I went.  The employee there listened to every word I said and suggested the Ghost 10 and said it had a lot of positive feedback.  I tried them on, and it wasn't like my feet were engulfed in a cloud.  The next day I ran in them, and it was the first time IN YEARS that my feet didn't hurt.  I literally started crying in the middle of my run, but not because of pain.  It was because I was amazed and beyond happy that my feet finally did not hurt!  My Ghost 10's are the most incredibly comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  They fit like a dream, are very light weight and great for any kind of run, long or short.  Very durable and good for any type of foot strike.  I am a Brooks customer FOR LIFE!",
120246,4,10/29/2017,"Fits and feels great I love the way the Ghost 10 feels and fits.  Sort of feels like my old favorite (Ghost 7).  I'm a little worried about how the shoe will hold up.  I typically wear a hole in the top from my big toe, the fabric seems a bit weak - although very comfortable.  Cautiously optimistic that the hole will not come sooner than in the past.  Other than that concern, which may not be a concern, I love it!",
120246,4,10/29/2017,First time buyer I'm very brand loyal but after too many changes to my favorite style I ended up with a foot injury.  Tried Brooks for the first time and love the Ghost 10.  It's comfortable and absorbs a lot of the shock.  #reviewsweeps,
120246,5,10/28/2017,#ReviewSweeps if they wear well I will definitely buy again #ReviewSweeps...I use my ghost 10 to run in and on occasion wear them to go grocery shopping. They are extremely comfortable and I am pleased with them much more than the 3 pairs of Brooks gts 14 I am changing from which all got holes near toe in them.,
120246,5,10/28/2017,"Favorite running shoe Running, walking the dog and working out at the gym. Lightweight and versatile with a lot of stability. I always keep an extra pair on hand so I'm never without.",
120246,5,10/28/2017,"Thumbs up These shoes are awesome as always. I've been wearing brooks ghosts for almost 7 years now. They have great support without being too clunky. The color on this shoe is eye grabbing. I used to be an avid runner logging in 30+ miles a week before knee surgery in December. I run less now, but the brooks were great then and are still great now. #ReviewSweels",
120246,5,10/27/2017,I love my Brooks Running shoes! I'm A waitress and I have had my feet hurting me for quite a while now and got recommended brooks running shoes. I tried them out and I absolutely love them! No complaints from me!,
120246,5,10/27/2017,"Amazing!! Oh my gosh!!  These shoes are like walking on clouds compared to the shoes I was wearing...my old pair (actually only 6 months old) were Salomon which were big, clunky, heavy, and squeaked which is weird but they did.  The company did not stand by their product and would not let me return them after first month when they started squeaking so I tried to get my use out of them but my feet started hurting so I finally broke down and bought these shoes.  My only regret is that I waited so long...I put these on and the first day my feet stopped hurting...they were so supportive yet cushy and really light!  I wear them every day to either work out in (HIIT/gym) or run.  They are wonderful.  I wear a 10.5 narrow which is very hard to find and not look like the black Reebok shoes we wore in the 80's :) and the fit is perfect...exactly what I would expect.  I've never owned a pair of Brooks but I have to say I will be a repeat customer!!!",
120246,5,10/27/2017,My 6th pair of ghost.  Love them The brooks team are great.  I had purchased a pair of ghost shoes several months before I needed them because they were on sale.  When I went to wear them the fit was not right.  I contacted customer service and they gladly exchanged them for me even though it was 3 months after I bought them.,

120246,5,10/25/2017,"Finally! I am an intermediate runner, running about 20-25 miles a week, most of them runs of 5 plus miles. I always have had heel/Achilles tendon issues and recently thanks to my procrastinating and running in old shoes had developed plantar fascitiis problems.  My only pair of Brooks that I had ever tried was the Adrenaline and sadly those didn't work for me, but Brooks has an amazing returns process and I received a full refund.  I decided to try the Ghost and I could not be happier.  I prefer a more substantial shoe with cushion and support and these deliver without being at all heavy or clunky.  The design is fantastic, and although the look of the shoe doesn't help me run better it sure does help me want to lace them up!  Even the shoe laces are well thought out, long enough to do a heel lock and with some stretch so that they aren't hanging all over the place.  I just love these and am already considering another pair just so I can rest a pair in between runs.",
120246,5,10/25/2017,"Best Run of my Life Extremely light and comfortable, recently running I would get shin splints and sore legs. After wearing the brooks only one day I noticed none of the splints or pain. This will be my go to shoe from here on out.",

120246,5,10/24/2017,"Love at first run I have tried many different Brooks running shoes. They all have been great, but the are by far my favorite. I have been missing out by not trying the Ghosts sooner. The cushion is perfect, very comfortable but not so much that I can't feel my run. These have helped to keep me more stable because I am an overpronator.",
120246,5,10/23/2017,"Love Ghosts! I've bought Ghost's for about 3-4 years now, and sometimes I try to switch and go off to another Brooks shoe but I always find myself returning to my Ghost's!  This year was no different.  I was preparing for a 10-miler race and realized I needed to get a new shoe so of course I ordered these and they are just as wonderful as all of the other Ghost's I've gotten in the past. For some reason they feel a little tighter on my feet than the other ones did, but I feel like that's the new shoe feel and they will stretch!  Otherwise, the toe box is perfectly spacious and that's always hard to find in running shoes so I am super pleased.  I would definitely buy these again!!",
120246,5,10/23/2017,Love! Ghost 10 is my favorite ghost yet. Love this ghost 10 I didn't have to break the shoe in at all. Perfect from first run!,
120246,5,10/23/2017,"Best running shoe out there, point. Everything about this shoe is perfection. From the easy glide shoe laces and the tracking of the shoe, the most comfortable shoe for running. I had knee pain before with other very expensive running shoes, but Brooks Ghost 10 took care of that. No more pain. I use them even for crossfire training and the stability of these surpasses all I have tried before. I will buy them in other colors.",
120246,5,10/23/2017,I would buy this product again. This is my 4th pair of Ghosts. They never disappoint and I never have to break them in. True comfort from the very first step!,
120246,5,10/22/2017,"For the Win The Brooks Ghost 10s were a delightful change of pace for me. After running in the same shoe for years, I finally decided to switch it up. I love the Ghost 10s and I wouldn't change a thing. The plush collar and roomy toe box are my favorite features! #ReviewSweeps",
120246,5,10/22/2017,Love Brooks ,
120246,5,10/21/2017,Love these shoes. Supportive and very comfortable! ,
120246,5,10/21/2017,Love them!!! I wear these shoes to walk in but I wear them to work every single day! I love them and they are so comfortable. I would buy these again.,
120246,5,10/21/2017,"LOVE this shoe! Well worth it! I've tried a couple other brands of running shoe but these are the best! Instantly comfortable! I've never gotten blisters, or sore spots on my feet from them. The cushion around the opening of the shoe helps a lot. I've never gotten blisters on my heel or ankle area from it rubbing against me. They are well worth the money!",
120246,5,10/21/2017,"Great shoe Wore them for the first time and was two miles into my run before I remembered I had new shoes on! My feet just felt perfect. Love the cushioning, laces up snug, and tread is great on both gravel roads and pavement.",
120246,5,10/20/2017,I would buy this product again...for sure! I love to run in these shoes. I'm training for a half marathon and love these.,
120246,5,10/20/2017,I love this product I  purchased these because I'm on my feet all the time and I never found a good shoe until now!  Love them! #ReviewSweeps,
120246,5,10/20/2017,Beat shoes ever ,
120246,5,10/19/2017,I would buy this product again!!!! I wear these shoes for everyday walking and easy runs!! Love the feel of these shoes!!,
120246,5,10/19/2017,"I would definitely buy this product again I love the bright colors of this shoe and the neat design around the ankle. I know the appearance shouldn't matter that much, but I still like it. Very comfortable shoe and plenty of room in the toe box. I will continue to wear the Ghost Brooks and will have a hard time switching to any other shoe. My Brooks shoes always seem to last the longest and stay in pretty good shape, even after I put 300+ miles on them.",
120246,5,10/19/2017,Love love love! I have been struggling with plantar facetious for a very long time and these shoes have been a saving grace!! Love them!!,
120246,5,10/18/2017,Very comfortable I stand all day and these felt wonderful. I did not even notice my shoes once today which is awesome. Just firm support but still feels like a cloud. I like them very much.,
120246,5,10/18/2017,Love the Ghost 10 ,
120246,5,10/17/2017,"Great for Long Runs! I have been running exclusively for the past few years in all the different models of the Launch. I loved those shoes, however, this year I started training for my first marathon. After long runs of over 14 miles, I found that sadly the Launch were not making my joints feel great. I decided to the Ghost 10 and have had wonderful results! The Ghost has enough cushion to make sure my joints do not hurt anywhere as bad as they would with similar run lengths in my old shoes. It took me a few runs to get used to the added weight and cushion, but now I wouldn't run in anything else for long training runs. I will say I learned from experience with the Launch to order a half size larger and I am glad I did to get extra room in the toe. #ReviewSweeps",
120246,5,10/17/2017,"Great for Long Runs I have been running exclusively for the past few years in all the different versions of the Launch shoes, which I completely love. But, I have started training for my first marathon and found that runs over 14 miles were just not cutting it for my knees in the Launch. I bought the Ghost 10 and I am very happy I have! I don't feel the same aches and pains that I would feel in similar run lengths in these shoes. I will say, learning from my experience in the Launch, I ordered a half size larger and that really does help toe comfort. It took a few runs to get used to the weight and cushion of the shoe, but now I absolutely wouldn't run long distances without these.",
120246,5,10/17/2017,"LOVE THESE SHOES! I abandoned Brooks Ghost runners with the ""7"" version, which wasn't great for me.  I am so happy I ordered these ""10"" Ghost runners.  Beautiful shoe, but really great support and comfort.  I walk everyday, take these to the gym.  Wish that Brooks made shoes for tennis!",
120246,5,10/17/2017,"The Ghost 10 is the best one ever! I have been buying the Ghost for about 5 years and truly love it.  I now have my husband, daughter, and my best friend wearing it and loving it as well!",
120246,5,10/17/2017,Perfect fit!! ,
120246,2,10/17/2017,"Unhappy with the new model I'm not sure what has changed with this model but I have run in the Ghost since it first came out and I can't run in the 10. This shoe makes every joint in my legs hurt. I went back to the 8 and no problem. Hopefully these changes aren't here to stay because it took a long time to find the Ghost, which has been the only shoe that works for me until now :(",
120246,5,10/17/2017,Absolutely Was fitted with Brooks Ghost about 5-6 yrs ago after spinal surgery and needed some very supportive athletic shoes for walking and the gym/PT.  The fit is great and always comfortable. Feet no longer bother me when I walk for a long time.,
120246,5,10/16/2017,Favorite shoe EVER! I LOVE this shoe.  I tried the Glycerine but was having trouble with blisters.  Not the case with the Ghost!  Best shoe - no complaints at all!!!!!,
120246,5,10/16/2017,Thumbs up ,
120246,5,10/15/2017,In love with them and a great running shoe I had the ghost 9 shoes but it was time for a new pair.  The Ghost 10s are awesome and everything I was hoping for.  My knees are not the best and with the Brooks running shoes I never have a problem and have great support and cushion.,
120246,5,10/15/2017,They are AWESOME!!! ,
120246,5,10/15/2017,"I would buy this shoe again and again! I walk daily, recuperating from hip impingement surgery.  Great comfort and supportive shoe.  Slowly working towards jogging/running.",
120246,5,10/14/2017,would buy again I got the Ghost 10 shoe as my first Brooks purchase. I think these are the most comfortable sneakers I've had. The color is lighter than I would've liked (I really liked the men's in color 034!) because I got them for running in agility with my dog so they're not going to stay clean for long. I would buy again.,
120246,3,10/14/2017,Disappointed Absolutely loved my Ghost 8! Disappointed in Ghost 10. Cushioning and arch support have diminshed much to quickly. Quality is not what I have come to expect from Brooks.,
120246,5,10/14/2017,Would definitely buy this shoe again! I use these shoes for my weekly runs (6-10miles) and haven't yet had a chance to race in them. They are amazingly comfortable yet lightweight. Not too much padding and a good road feel.,
120246,5,10/14/2017,I will definitely replace my shoes with more Brooks! I bought this pair as an extra! I loved the neural color and was excited to see they weren't bright wild colors! I tried another brand and my feet hurt so back to Brooks in a heart beat!#Brookssweeps,
120246,4,10/13/2017,always a good shoe ,
120246,4,10/13/2017,"Most comfortable running shoe I have ever owned! The traction and cushion are fantastic.  The shoe could have a little more stability for me, but for road running they are perfect.",
120246,5,10/13/2017,"Great shoes Returning to neutral running shoes after trying stability. This is my favorite pair of Ghosts so far, I have had several. Very comfortable and no complaints!",
120246,5,10/12/2017,"Recovering from Injury! I injured myself on June 26th. I did something to my right foot. Had heel pain, pain in my out foot, arch pain. The only part of my foot that didn't hurt seemed to be the ball of my feet. Who knows what happened. I didn't go to the doctor. I rested and waited. And decided that i wanted to try a different running shoe. Started talking to other people and doing online research. I found out many of my friends liked their Brooks shoes. I had never tried Brooks and was skeptical. I was coming off an injury and didn't know if it would be the right time to buy a new shoe model. I purchased a brand new pair of my regular model running shoe (I won't name them) and decided to purchase a pair of Brooks too. I took the online shoe recommender survey. Ghost 10 was the recommendation. It was easy to purchase the Brooks because of the 90 day money back guarantee too. My Brooks and old favorites showed up on the same day. OMG. I really thought my favorites brand was the best until I tried out my Brooks. Needless to say, I love them. They are WAY better than my previous running shoes. Now, I've only put 40 miles on these shoes but so far, so good. And, because of my foot injury, I've made a commitment to myself to get a new pair every 450 miles. I still have occasional discomfort in the heel, arch of my foot and this does scare me. I'm just so thankful to be able to get out and run again. I didn't realize just how much I missed it. Hopefully, my foot will continue to get better. Thanks Brooks. I'm glad I tried you and have recommended you to my friends.",
120246,5,10/12/2017,Love the stability ,
120246,5,10/12/2017,Best shoes ever!!!! I had perpetual foot pain until these shoes. I have took to wearing these for everything. I need several more pairs so I don't wear these out. Best shoes buy ever!,
120246,5,10/12/2017,"Wonderfully surprised I normally wear the Defyance but wanted some other color options. I had a bad experience with blistering in Ghost 10 so was nervous about trying these. They fit great, have a great ride, and I have no pain in my legs or feet. The toe box feels a little wide but that is not problem. Would high recommend these to any neutral runner.",
120246,5,10/12/2017,"Will buy them again I have purchased these shoes to run the Chicago marathon. I needed something comfortable and fast. These shoes did their job and I am so happy I used them. I used the version 9 during my training and liked them very much. However, I felt that the version 10 was more comfortable. My feet thanked me at the end of the race.",
120246,5,10/12/2017,Beautiful new shoes The fit is very comfortable. I use these shoes mainly indoors at this time but will soon transition to outside use in Florida this winter. I hope they feel this good when I use them outside.,
120246,4,10/12/2017,"Ugh. They're so great but so ugly. But seriously. They're perfect for my foot and I swear by them. I've been running in the ghost for 8 years now and counting. But I just wish every time I buy a new pair that they'd have somebody design these shoes to look good!! They're always so dang ugly!!! ITS SO BAD but I don't have a choice, they fit me perfectly. They're ugly enough that if I found a equally as good fitting shoe, I'd switch. Brooks, if you're reading this, get up to date with your design team. Come on!!",
120246,5,10/12/2017,"Love,love,love these shoes! I walk 4 miles in one hour every day. These shoes have good support, and yet are so buoyantly comfortable, I feel I am being propelled along by them. I think the Ghost 10 is about the best edition yet!",
120246,5,10/11/2017,"Most comfortable shoe I've worn in years! On my first run in these shoes, there was a noticeable difference. I love that the impact of the heel area is supported and minimized by the structure of the shoe. I'm old, and need this type of impact-bearing sole.",
120246,5,10/11/2017,Great shoes! I love these shoes. They have made a big difference for my foot comfort. I recommend them to anyone who runs 6/7 days a week.,
120246,2,10/11/2017,"Not as good as former version of Ghost I have had several pairs of Brooks Ghost so I stick with what works and got the 10.  I got the same size I've always worn and they are a tad too small and I don't seem to be ""settling"" into them as well as my other pairs.  And the style is a little less appealing than I thought. Old version has better structure, these seem a little too soft.  I've only run 5x in them so I'll give it another few runs, but will likely have to find a new pair.",
120246,5,10/09/2017,Lightweight.  Orhtotics fit well in them. Been wearing Ghost for years.  Love their lightweight feel and flat sole that accommodates to custom orthotics.,
120246,5,10/08/2017,"Exactly what I was hoping for I run about 3.5 miles, twice a week. Previously I wore Nike Frees, but they were digging into the inside of the ball of my right foot and leaving blisters. I knew it was time to invest in a pair of real running shoes (sorry Nike - I'll still wear your athleisure shoes!) The Ghost 10s were pretty much everything I hoped for. They have a grippy sole which provides a tactile feel, but also a lot of cushioning - a surprisingly effective combination. I ordered a half size up (8) just in case, but I think my standard size (7.5) would have probably been just fine. The biggest selling point was their 90-day guarantee. It made me feel confident that I could give the shoes a proper trial before totally committing to them. As it turns out I probably won't need to return it this time around. Looking forward to my next pair of Brooks running shoes!",
120246,5,10/08/2017,"I would buy this product again Was hesitant about the width as I have bunions, but the medium was plenty wide and doesn't rub the bunions.",
120246,5,10/08/2017,"Love the Ghosts! I am on my feet all day. I wear my Ghost 10s everyday and my feet, knees and back feel great. It's like walking in a cloud. My last 3 pairs of sneakers have been Ghosts. I plan to try a different model my next purchase but am fearful they will not stand up to the Ghosts.",
120246,5,10/08/2017,I would highly recommend this shoe! ,
120246,5,10/07/2017,"Love my Brooks Ghost 10's! I am a middle-aged, middle-sized runner.  Toe joint pain means I need a wider toe box that doesn't squeeze the great toe joint,  and I need food cushion and stability for the hips.  ghost 10 does it all, and the cool silver is a nice change from my typical ""brighter the better"" philosophy.",
120246,5,10/07/2017,"I'm 100% impressed with the support for my arches I have plantar faciitis, very narrow feet, and am a vet tech where I am on my feet 12 hours a day. These have amazing support and keep me pain free better than any other shoe I've tried.",
120246,5,10/07/2017,"I absolutely love the ghost 10 I started trainijng for a full marathon... my first one.  I run in my ghost 10's for all my short and middle distance runs.  I use my glycerin 15's for my long run.  My ghost 10's are cushioned, but not mushy.  I love these shoes.",
120246,4,10/06/2017,"Feel great They feel great, unfortunately I am getting blisters, which is not uncommon but I just wish Brooks would try a foot shaped toe box to help people like me that do better with that shape",
120246,5,10/06/2017,Love the shoe ,
120246,5,10/06/2017,Great Running shoe I love the shoes! They are very comfortable and I often buy 2-3 pairs a year depending on the miles I run.  They are always comfortable and really help with push off and shock absorption during running.,
120246,5,10/06/2017,"Best running shoes Have been training for a 10k and my knees have been hurting for a while and from the moment I tried my ghost10 and went for a run I could immediately feel the difference and my knees have stopped bothering me I'm just super glad I ordered them , and the colors are AMAZING the photo does not do them justice",
120246,5,10/06/2017,This is my new standby shoe. A staple in my closet! I work in a warehouse on concrete. I also run. Even though I know these will break down due to he hours spent in them- I don't want to take them off. I'll buy more in 3 months! They saved me from pain at work AND during exercise!,

120246,5,10/05/2017,Perfect shoe This is my work shoe I am on my feet 8 hr. Shift.With my orthotics in the shoe fits perfect. My foot is narrow but no problem in this shoe. My fert don't hurt after 8 hours. I have talked a few coworkers into trying Ghost. I like look of LE. Thanks #ReviewSweeps,

120246,5,10/05/2017,"I would buy this product again No pinching, comfortable cushions to my instep.Feet do not burn on long walks. Great feel!",
120246,2,10/05/2017,"Fit great, looked great, but caused a foot injury first time I run about 4x a week approximately 2-3 miles. I've been running about 15 years and have ran in brooks for the last 3-4 years. Never had any foot pain, ankle issues etc. On my very first run in these new shoes on a treadmill at the normal speed I run at, I began experiencing ankle pain a couple minutes in but pushed through. Pain got much worse in coming days. Went to orthopedic doctor finally and he said it was a sprained ankle. Haven't been able to do any exercise for 2 weeks and have trouble even walking. Could be coincidence but unlikely. I'm guessing this shoe does not have adequate ankle support. It seemed to fit great, was comfortable and probably the nicest looking running shoe I've owned. Disappointing",
120246,5,10/04/2017,Love. ,
120246,5,10/04/2017,"Sold on Brooks!!! I like the width of the toe box, it keeps your toes from rubbing.  The shoe is lightweight and comfortable.  I have always run in Asics and my boyfriend suggested I try Brooks since that is what he has always run in.   Brooks....where have you been all my life :)",
120246,5,10/03/2017,"My Goasts are my answer. These new Goasts got a quick intoduction to what lies ahead. I took them out onto ten hills trail..a popular local trail which is just that -10 100 mtr.hills ,untouched by pavement or other useless inventions of man.There they supported me,chewed up the ground beneath my feet as I went nose before toes on the uphills and earned the downhills all the way to the gate where the workout ends.",
120246,5,10/03/2017,I'm hooked on the Ghost style! I use my Ghost 10's for running.  They are so light but provide a solid base for foot strike.   This is my first pair of Ghost's but i love them!,
120246,5,10/03/2017,Does not disappoint The ghost line has always been my go to shoe.  I have tried other brands and other Brooks models but the ghost is my true love.,
120246,4,10/03/2017,"Most cushion I've ever felt in a shoe I bought this shoe in the grey and silver. This shoe is unbelievabley soft. It is perfect for work shoe for a job where you are on your feet all day. However, I returned my shoe because it was too wide in the toes. Brooks has the best customer service I've ever felt with.",

120246,5,09/30/2017,Running on cloud 10! I have been running in these for about 3 weeks no they are the most cushioned running shoe I have ever owned! I got fitted at my local running shop and could not be happier. Just wish there were more color options in the wide width. Would love the all white and silver ones. But otherwise they are perfect!,
120246,5,09/30/2017,I would definitely buy again ,
120246,5,09/30/2017,I will buy this again! I read the reviews and ordered a half size bigger than usual. These shoes fit great and are very comfortable!,

120246,5,09/30/2017,"Great Shoes I have been wearing Ghosts for almost 10 years. They're truly a life changer for me as I have extremely broken down arches from years of Figure Skating. This particular pair does feel slightly wider in the toes compared to my previous pairs, but they are still TTS. I go from running just a few days a week to running 4-5 and go between outdoor and treadmill. I have worn them when I've lived in flat terrain areas and when I've lived in extremely mountainous areas and they have been great.",
120246,4,09/30/2017,"Always love my Ghost shoes I don't distance run, but I teach a variety of group fitness classes...roughly 10 a week. My Brooks Ghost shoes always keep my feet feeling great. However, I do think this limited edition ones seem a notch below the quality of my last few pairs. I love the look, but the structure seems a little flimsy.",
120246,5,09/29/2017,"I love these shoes! I run/ work out about 5 days a week and I am on my feet all day at work. I wear my Brooks 'Revel' for working (they have more cushion- extremely comfortable!!!), and I wear these for working out and running. They have the perfect balance of cushion and support.

120246,5,09/26/2017,"It's all good! Love the color, fit, lace length and how substantial it is. The sole is protective yet I can feel the road/trail. It breathes! Run all over but mostly Austin, Texas, and it works for hot trails and jumping into Lake Travis!I confess to buying 3 pair Ghost 10! Best ever. Been a fan since early 2000.",

They are so comfortable and durable.  I have introduced your shoes to many fellow nurses and won them over.  I wont buy anything else.,

120246,3,09/24/2017,"On the fence... Bought these in the black/pink in a 7 and they were too small. I returned them for a 7.5, but in the limited edition color (which came out just after I bought the original pair). These seem a half size too big. They feel good on the run, but I obsess about the extra room while running. Not sure what to do.",

After spending several seasons running mostly in the Brooks Pure line, I found that my supinating feet needed a little more cushion, but wanted to keep my running kicks lightweight still.  The Ghost is the PERFECT shoe for exactly that purpose, from training for a 5K to a marathon!",
120246,5,09/22/2017,"Hands down the best! I know everyone says it ""feels like you're running on air"" or clouds or any other combination of soft things... but it's true!

120246,5,09/20/2017,"I love these shoes! I absolutely love these shoes. They are much more cushioned and comfortable than the last running shoes I had, and have enough room in the toe box that I don't feel squished when my feet swell. They also have amazing arch support.",
120246,5,09/19/2017,"Love these! Most comfortable Ghost I've worn yet! I couldn't wear the 9's, they hit my arch wrong but these fit great, seem more cushioned then the 8s. If anything they seem slightly too wide in the toe box but that gives my foot room to expand on longer runs and hasn't seemed to bother me at all. Great for people with wider feet. I love the new, more minimalistic color line. Great job Brooks!",
120246,5,09/19/2017,This is the best shoe! Thanks for adding the shoelace holder I have knee and hip issues but walk 3-5 days a week.  The physical therapist looked at my shoes and even stated this is a good shoe!  Thank you for adding the additional shoelace holder.  This prevents the tongue from being pulled to one side.  That was my only issue before the improvement.,

120246,3,09/18/2017,"Not the worst running shoe I've owned Its a nice style.  Light Weight.  I'm 5'3"" 125 lbs.  Its comfortable to run in.  However the sneaker just seems chincy for the price.  I usually change the insoles out to  a soft sole which is better for me.  Its a good sneaker.  I bought two pair because it seems every time I buy one pair 3 to 6 months later they either don't sell it or make it the same way.  We'll see how long this one lasts.",
120246,5,09/18/2017,LOVE the new Ghost 10! I wear my Ghost 10 for runs that are 5+ miles. Toe offs feel effortless and efficient. Can't think of anything I would change!,
120246,5,09/17/2017,"Wore straight out of the box for a half marathon -- perfect! I have been a long time wearer of the Asics Gel Noosa line for the past few years.  However, I haven't been happy with the fit or quality of them since the Gel Noosa Tri 9 (tighter toe box, not very much cushion despite the claims for the model).  A few friends had recommended Brooks to me, but I was hesitant to pay the high price for them.  However, I had a half marathon coming up (which I ran today) and knew I needed a new pair of shoes ASAP in order to get through the race. So I took the plunge and purchased these, and I could not be happier. I wore these straight out of the box without breaking them in prior to my race this morning and had no issues whatsoever. In fact, it didn't even feel like I was running in new shoes -- they felt like they'd been worn many, many times. While I would not recommend others wearing shoes right out of the box for a race since it can cause injury, I had no choice do to the immense pain my other shoes started to cause me.  But, I think my situation speaks highly regarding the quality and comfort of the Ghost 10. I will be purchasing another pair in the future for sure!",
120246,3,09/17/2017,"Not Sure...Yet I skipped the Ghost 9 and was excited to try the Ghost 10 series. Not sure if I am just needing to break these in but they do not feel as responsive as my previous Ghost (5,6,7,8). I'm also noticing some shin pain after runs. I'll have plenty of opportunities to test these out with a 10 mile race and 1/2 marathon coming up.  I'll update once I get a few more months under my belt with these.",
120246,5,09/16/2017,"Incredibly comfortable It was time to invest money in good running shoes--finally up and running after hip surgery for a labral tear 18 months ago. These shoes are well-cushioned, fit wonderfully, and allow me to run much more pain-free.",
120246,5,09/16/2017,Very comfortable! I overpronate slightly but this shoe provides enough stability for an extremely comfortable run. I normally run in the Ravenna style but haven't been truly satisfied since the 5's so I decided to try a different shoe. I'm so glad I did!,
120246,5,09/15/2017,"Yes, I would buy this product again. ",
120246,5,09/15/2017,Spring in my step! I love these running shoes. They give me just enough support without feeling pillowy. They have a gentle spring to them which makes me feel like I'm running with greater ease. I love them.,
120246,1,09/14/2017,First Brooks shoes causes injury I've been training for my first marathon and trying these shoes resulted in me unable to train for over a week now. I haven't had any injuries for over a year. I'll never buy Brooks again.,
120246,5,09/14/2017,My favorite running shoe! The Ghost 10 is your best yet!  Feels a little wider in the toe box which is perfect for me!!,
120246,5,09/14/2017,"Very comfortable, have 2 pair I wear them all day, every day for work and casual (2 pair). They are really comfortable all over, roomy in the toes. Highly recommend. Look nice too. Like neutral color since I wear light color pants.",
120246,5,09/13/2017,Brooks Ghost is the Best ,
120246,5,09/13/2017,"I would recommend this shoe to everyone! When I received my new Ghost 10's I thought I would put them on and walk around to get used to them and stretch them out a bit. As soon as I put them on I fell in love. They fit like a glove, they absorbed the impact of my feet hitting the road, I love love love my shoes. I have been recommending them to everyone I know!!",
120246,5,09/12/2017,"Love this shoe!!!!!!! I have had many surgeries on my feet and was always in pain.Decided to try these shoes after being a lifetime customer of asics.Must say I fell in love with the first step!First time in years I can work out,walk,run....all pain free all day long!Best investment I ever made.Have only had them for a month so-hopefully they hold up longer than most shoes but,so far so good.Would recommend them to everyone!",
120246,5,09/12/2017,"Happy I have two pair of these shoes, one for in the house and one for outside.  I have joint replacements, back pain, and fibromyalgia.  These shoes give me the foot support I need to get through my days.  I'd like to see more color combinations with primarily black.",
120246,5,09/10/2017,"Brooks hits it out of the park with these shoes! I have been running in Brooks for nearly 20 years. I have always been a fan of the Ghost series and the Ghost 10 does not disappoint. Ran 5 mi in them the first day out of the box and it was pure perfection! They fit great, so comfortable and breathable. If you love the Ghost series, buy them. You won't regret it.",
120246,5,09/10/2017,"Love the Ghost 10! This upgrade to the Ghost is so awesome! Very comfy, cushioned & perfect for long runs. I was battling plantar f. could barely walk & these helped me get in the 20 mile training runs for a marathon without pain! I run over 40 miles/week, 6 days. A little bigger than Launch sizing. I wear a 9.5 in Launch, 9 in Ghosts. Thank you Brooks!!!",
120246,5,09/09/2017,"Worth every dime I am an RN and have had chronic problems with hip pain from being on my feet. With the Brooks shoes I am never aware of any foot, calf, or hip discomfort. They are lightweight, and you are barely aware you even have shoes on. I bought a different (expensive) popular brand of RN shoes after I wore out my first pair of Brooks, and after 3 weeks my hip pain was back with a vengeance. So, now I am happily ensconced in another Pair of Brooks Ghost shoes and will NEVER buy another brand.",
120246,5,09/09/2017,"I would buy this product again and again. Very comfortable shoe. The toe box is nice and large, my heel doesn't slip and it is very comfortable.",
120246,3,09/09/2017,"Different Structure I have been wearing Ghosts for years. They are wonderful running shoes! However, the new Ghost 10's are unlike the previous pairs with their cushioning in the front. The new shoes are now designed with three sections under the front of the foot as opposed to two. I used to feel as if I was running on clouds. Hoping the 11's go back to thicker cushioning!",
120246,5,09/08/2017,"Ghost 10 is truly the best yet! Think I'll get another pair! My first pair of Brooks were the Ghost about 6 years ago. I then tried the Glycerin, the Launch, the Ravenna and most recently the new Revel. Yes I am a Brooks finatic! When I saw the new Ghost 10 I loved the look so I ordered them and I'm so glad I did! I love all my Brooks shoes! They've never let me down but these Ghost 10 are amazing! I think they made them especially for me! Lol!",
120246,5,09/08/2017,Finally Back! I've been waiting for Brooks to bring back to comfort and durability the Ghost 6 had. Its finally back. These are by far the most comfortable Brook's Ghost running shoes in a few years.,
120246,3,09/07/2017,"Fantastic except for the collar Switched to this shoe from Asics Nimbus, and I love it except for the fact that the collar has already frayed open up towards the front. And this is only after about two weeks of wear.  I expect more from Brooks in terms of quality and am extremely disappointed because its otherwise a great shoe, super comfortable and great as an everyday trainer.",
120246,5,09/06/2017,"Holy Cushion! By far my favorite version of the Ghost! After running in various versions of this shoe over the years, I made a switch to the Adidas Ultra Boost 3 years ago because I fell in love with the extra cushion but these shoes fit great and feel amazing on the road! The new DNA cushioning is awesome. Super easy to break in and after a mile or two of weird mid foot ""cramping"" as my foot adjusted, I am totally impressed. So happy with the changes made and happy to be back in my Ghost's!",
120246,5,09/05/2017,"Love these, feel like I'm floating ",
120246,5,09/05/2017,Love them!! I'm a nurse & when I started having issues with plantar fascitis I knew I had to get better shoes. My 1st pair of Brooks shoes lasted about 2.5 years.  After a couple of weeks wearing them & doing some foot exercises I stopped having pain in my feet.  Just got my 2nd pair (ghost 10) & they felt like they were made for my feet the moment I put them on😍😍Love love love them  I will always wear Brooks shoes,
120246,3,09/04/2017,Comfy shoe that tears up after 6 weeks This was my first brook purchase and I love the shoe so comfortable but after wearing for just 6 weeks the shoe is already tearing up. I can't justify spending this much on a shoe that tears up so quickly.,
120246,5,09/04/2017,Comfortable for being on your feet all day! Very cushioned in the heel and feels like I'm walking on air. I'm on my feet 40 hrs a week on concrete and so far these keep my feet happy all day. This is my first pair of Brooks and I think I'm hooked!,
120246,5,09/04/2017,"I love these shoes, I would buy them again ",
120246,5,09/04/2017,LOVE LOVE LOVE BROOKS GHOST I found Ghost after I had a back injury 13 years ago. Amazing comfort and I will not wear anything else.,
120246,5,09/02/2017,"Perfect right out of the box! I bought these to alternate with my current shoes while training for a marathon, but now I just want to wear these every day! Very comfortable and cushioned but also feel more responsive than other similar shoes I've worn in the past. Foot feels secure but with plenty of room in the toe box. I have the pink color and was worried they were too intense, but have received lots of compliments!",
120246,5,09/01/2017,"Love my Brooks Ghost I walk 7 - 10 miles daily and have worn Brooks Ghost or Brooks Glycerin for several years. Love the wide toe box and cushioning. Ordered the neutral grey thinking it would go with more colors of clothing.  I was correct, but they are a little bland....I miss having a brighter shoe and am planning on getting the new turquoise Glycerin next.",
120246,5,08/31/2017,"Brooks convert These are my first Brooks, so I can't compare them to other styles. However, compared to other running shoes I've worn (new balance and mizuno) these take the cake. So comfortable, no break in time. I'm a Brooks convert!",
120246,5,08/30/2017,Love my Ghosts I love the new ghost I've owned every ghost since the three and every year they keep getting better and better,
120246,5,08/30/2017,"Great Shoe! My original intent was to buy some trail running shoes that I would be able to use while playing softball.  I also had concerns with comfort and width in the shoes I would be purchasing.  ln speaking with the person on the floor, she recommended running shoes with a good grip and brought me a pair of the Brooks Ghost 10.  These are my first pair of Brooks and I LOVE them!  I use them as my everyday go to sneaker and hate to get these dirty playing softball.  Now I need to purchase another pair!",
120246,1,08/30/2017,not sure the rubber on the bottom is ripping! wore the sneakers 3 times and noticed the rubber under the big toe on the bottom of sneaker is ripping!!!!!,
120246,4,08/29/2017,Love the overall comfort but hurts top of big toe But it is killing the top of my big toe due to the extended design on the top of the toe box. If it weren't for that I would love this shoe. Too bad I have to return it after wearing it one day. I did get the wide width so it isn't that. I'm stuck at work and can't wait to get these shoes off due to my toes hurting so bad.,
120246,4,08/29/2017,Love the Ghost I walk at least five miles every day.  I love the Ghost because it has plenty of cushion for my heel spur problem.  The only change I would make is to produce them in neutral colors.,
120246,2,08/28/2017,"Disappointed I have ran in Ghosts 7, 8, 9 and the 10 is very disappinting. The seat feels very low and the overall support seems less than previous models. I'm experiencing Achilles problems for the first time ever. Not sure what has changed. I've always loved my ghosts.",
120246,4,08/28/2017,"The good and the bad First the good news - the painful toe guard which showed up on the Ghost 9 is gone!  Instantly more comfortable run with the Ghost 10.  However, Brooks removed some of the cushioning which Ghost's are famous for (I've been running in them for years - the Ghost 4 remains my personal favorite!), particularly in the forefoot, making for noticeably harder run.  Very sorry about that  - at my age, need all the cushioning I can get!",
120246,5,08/28/2017,Great Sneaker Great sneakers .I work out 5 days a week and would never buy any other brand. Brooks are a life changer for me.,
120246,5,08/27/2017,Awesome I was apprehensive in ordering an 8.5 but the fit finder was right on. I'm a solid size 7 but trusted the fit guide and BINGO!,
120246,5,08/26/2017,I would buy them again They weren't very comfortable when I first started wearing them. But I put an extra cushioned insole inside on top of the others and now I can wear them all day long. The shoe fits my foot good,
120246,5,08/26/2017,Love Ghost 10 ,
120246,5,08/26/2017,I always buy Brooks for walking. ,
120246,5,08/25/2017,"Happy Feet at 6 Months Pregnant!! I probably spent too much time researching and reviewing products. after doing some extensive research and testing if you other ""best"" new pairs of shoes these are the ones I wear almost daily. They are extremely comfortable, supportive, and have held up nicely through some rigorous hiking!",
120246,5,08/24/2017,"SO COMFY I loved the Ghost 8, skipped the Ghost 9 because I didn't like them when I tried them on, and really, really, really love my new Ghost 10. I have several foot problems so I wear my Brooks running shoes 90% of the time. These 10's are definitely a 10. So comfy and my husband says he could tell immediately that I walk better in them.",
120246,4,08/24/2017,I would buy this product again This is the first shoe from Brooks that I finally feel is the right shoe for me.  I have tried 4  other types and finally this one is the one.,
120246,4,08/24/2017,"Great shoe, but might be too big I feel like the mesh material causes my foot to move around to much, so now instead of my knees hurting, it's feet. I get an awful cramping in my the bottom of my feet after wearing these to run. Mostly if I'm running on the treadmill.",
120246,5,08/23/2017,"The best Ghost model yet I give credit to Brooks running shoes, specifically the Ghost model for healing my chronic plantar fasciitis years ago.  After years of pain, months of physical therapy and cortisone shots couldn't heal my foot.  I switched to Brooks on the recommendation of a sales person at Finish Line.  Switching to Brooks gave me my mobility back!  I've used Ghost since the Ghost 5 and was excited to try Ghost 10.  I've run about 5 times with them.  They are definitely lighter and feel like they provide even more stability.  Unless it's my imagination, the cushioning around my ankle is also softer.  I didn't think Ghost could get better, but it did!",
120246,5,08/23/2017,So glad I tried the Ghost I've been a committed fan to the Adrenaline for years. I've tried Pureflow and Launch as well.  But the Ghost offers cushion without the bulk.  Hands down my favorite running shoes.,
120246,5,08/20/2017,"Definitely I love love love these shoes. I previously wore ghost 8s, now have the ghost 10. The only thing I wish for is more color choices in wide width. Currently they are only offered in Black.",
120246,5,08/20/2017,"Fantastic! These are amazing! I run 6-7 miles a week, and they are so comfortable. Very well cushioned and fit true to size. Would definitely recommend!",
120246,5,08/17/2017,"LOVE THEM! I've have Ghost 8,9 and now 10...wow! Very happy i got 10- much better. Every Sunday, i run about 10-13 miles depending how early i get up. The Texas heat will beat you up if you are not up early--->Got to beat the sun.... My feet feel great after 10 mile run... worth every penny. I plan to get other colors soon. Thanks Brooks",
120246,5,08/17/2017,Great Comfortable Shoe ,
120246,5,08/16/2017,Love the Ghost 10's I do about 90% of my running on the treadmill. I go through a lot of shoes- but these 10's are holding up well and feel great on my lower back,
120246,5,08/12/2017,"Couldn't wear the 9s but I love Ghost 10! I have had Ghosts 4-9 and I loved all of them except the 9s.  Blisters every time I wore them on the inside of my foot by the toe box.  There was a hard piece of material on the shoe that rubbed my foot well after they should have been ""broken in.""  I tried taping the inside of the shoe with layers of KT tape to pad that area but it didn't help.  Just got a pair of the 10s and they are perfect.  No hard material there and no blisters!  So happy with these!  They are back to my favorite running shoe!",
120246,5,08/10/2017,Love these shoes! I wear these for walking and standing for long periods of time.  They are extremely comfortable.  Great cushioning and support.,
120246,4,08/10/2017,"Great shoes! The shoe is comfortable and lightweight. About 10 years ago I bought my 1st pair of Brooks shoes. Nothing since has been quite as awesome as that pair for comfort and fit,  but these run a close second.",
120246,5,08/10/2017,"Brooks never stops improving their product The 10s toebox is such an improvement over the 9s, no more lost or bruised toenails!After a few runs it felt as if the shoe conformed to my feet, so comfortable!",
120246,5,08/10/2017,Great running shoe for me! ,
120246,5,08/09/2017,"Best shoe yet! For the past 10 years, I have run in asics nimbus, brooks glycerin and ghost. Depending upon the updates I decide which I will purchase.  I run 6 days a week for 4 miles a day. Sometimes I throw in a 5 or 10 k race.  These are by far my favorite ever. I loved a previous ghost version as well, but the last ones were not my favorite. The ghost 10 are perfect right out of the box. I always buy a 1/2 to 1 size larger than my foot and these are no different. I will be sure to buy an extra pair because they are that comfortable!",
120246,5,08/03/2017,"Love at first run! I, too, have tried numerous brands and styles of running shoes.  I have hard to please feet with a super high arch and wide forefoot.  I could tell the second I put these on that they were a perfect fit. Perfectly roomy toe box without being too wide is so hard to come by these days.  The ride is amazing, it's the perfect amount of softness and responsiveness -- I have been looking for this for a long time.  I run quite a bit in the Launch but they can be a little too firm for longer runs, the Ghost seem like a perfect match for short and long runs. I cannot wait to see how they respond to higher mileage. A++",
120246,4,08/03/2017,"I really enjoyed these shoes.....I would buy them again I went over to a local store and tried several pair of Brooks on....but these were the most comfortable and fit great.When I walk or run, I get the support and cushion my feet need.  I am diabetic, so the more support and cushion my shoe has the better my feet feel. My feet didn't burn or hurt after a workout. Thanks",
120246,5,08/02/2017,The best running shoe ever!!!! I absolutely love this shoe! I will prolly buy every color. Just wish it came in solid black.,
120246,5,08/02/2017,Yet another amazing Brooks shoe! For the last 4 years I've purchased nothing but Brooks tennis shoes and couldn't be happier. This particular shoe is soft yet provides the perfect amount of support and has kept my plantar fasciitis issues at a minimum. I highly recommend Brooks!,
120246,5,08/01/2017,"Instant Love I had owned and loved an earlier model of this shoe and was honestly disappointed that the older model was not available.  However, when I first put on the Ghost 10 it was amazing!!!  There is literally no break-in period.  I think their box says ""lace up and go"" as a motto and it's 100% true.",
120246,5,08/01/2017,Love em!! ,
120246,5,08/01/2017,"I absolutely love the comfort and style. I love the comfort and style of the shoe. I love its versatility. I can run, walk and do my cardio utilizing the same shoe.",
120246,5,08/01/2017,Ghost 10 ,
120246,5,07/30/2017,"New favorires I ordered these and glycerine 15 at the same time to see which I liked best. I have been a glycerine fan in the past, but I loved these from the minute I put them on. They are so soft and comfortable, and the glycerine felt clunky in comparison.",
120246,5,07/29/2017,"FINALLY! A shoe that FITS and functions! LOVE them. I've tried 7 pairs of running shoes, and was despairing of finding a shoe that wouldn't hurt.  Either the sizing is off, or toe box is too narrow (causing neuroma-like pain), or the heels slipped even with lacing techniques.  This shoe is perfect. There is support cradling the heel and I did use the narrow-heel lacing technique for a secure fit. The fabulous thing is the mesh over the toes and top which give so there's room for my toes to spread out with no pinching, but I still felt very secure. There is great cushion too. I ran 3 miles out of the box with no issues. Hallelujah! These truly felt like an extension of my foot. I will be buying these again.",
120246,5,07/29/2017,Best Ghost Ever! I have been running in Ghost shoes since they first came out. This is the best product ever. They are extremely comfortable with enough cushion to satisfy my feet on a long run. A great trainer shoe. Switch to the launch for speed workout and you have the perfect combination!,
120246,5,07/28/2017,"Had to buy them As soon as I tried them on I knew I had to buy them.  The arch support  is just right, too high and not too low.",
120246,5,07/28/2017,Only Brooks will do!! Help support my bad back and knees. Wore them almost everyday while I was working and now that I'm retired I wear them everyday!,
120246,4,07/28/2017,"Love Color 144 (Microchip/White) - Please make in Wide! These are very comfortable, very soft sole and materials are top notch.  Really wanted the lightest color silver/white in a wide but unfortunately it didn't come in it.  I don't know why makers have such a fascination with multi colored combos that can't really be worn with anything other than road gear (and still look horrid against most outfits).  I feel these run wide, I usually wear a 7.5 wide in running shoes and ending up getting these in an 8 as I did not like any of the colors they carry in wide.  For reference, I wear a 7.5 wide in New Balance Gobi Trail and 7.5 extra wide in the New Balance 880s.  The 8 regular in these feel fine and the cushioning is superior, I have bunions and Mortons Neuroma and am still comfortable.",
120246,3,07/27/2017,Recommend only because its Brooks. ,
120246,3,07/27/2017,"eh, mediocre Seems as though us regular Ghost consumers have mixed feelings on the Ghost with each new edition.  The 10 has definitely got a much roomier toe box, but I don't have a Frodo foot so my feet are swimming. Not happy!  The 9s were less roomy and a better fit for my non-Frodo feet.",
120246,4,07/27/2017,I have bought this shoe for years! I think this is the most comfortable Ghost yet. My only complaint is that the design on the sides is starting to come off and I've only had the shoes for about a month and wear them only when I'm at work.,
120246,5,07/27/2017,Love them...... so much cushion ,
120246,2,07/25/2017,"They are ok I use these shoes primarily for running.  I hated the 8s, loved the 9s and I'm not impressed with the 10s.  There seems to be more cushioning in the heel, which is nice.  The toebox seems bigger, almost too big.   The tongue of the shoe changed.  There is extra material around the tongue which irritates the top of my foot.  I can wear them for shorter distances, but cannot imagine wearing them for runs longer than 5 or 6 miles.",
120246,5,07/25/2017,"Love These Shoes!! Love, love, love these shoes!!  I have been wearing Asics Nimbus for the past couple of years due to planter fasciitis and so glad I made the switch.  These shoes are amazing!",
120246,5,07/25/2017,I will buy another pair My second pair of Brooks Ghost but definitely not my last. Four miles straight out of the box and they were perfect! Love!!!,
120246,3,07/24/2017,"Felt good at first but didn't last Out of the box, these felt amazing! However, within the second week both of my ankles were getting cut into.  I put moleskin inside both of the sneakers in the ankles and wear bandaids but it is still bothering me.  Also, outer finishes of the sneakers are fading off and there is already wear and tear rips after only 3 weeks.  I have been a loyal Brooks fan since my youth and I have noticed the quality is going down as similar happened with another one of their sneakers recently for me.",
120246,5,07/22/2017,"Will be buying more pairs! I work in a factory and am on my feet sometimes 12 hr days and need my feet to be comfortable, I have purchased so many different brands of shoes to try and these ghost 10's are by far the best shoes I have owned! I am so impressed and go home with zero foot pain, will definitely be buying more pairs!",
120246,5,07/22/2017,"Love these shoes!! Made the switch fro Asics Gel Nimbus and so glad I did!  Love, love, love them!!",
120246,5,07/22/2017,"Best Ghost yet Love these shoes!  Started wearing Ghosts with the 7, skipped the 8 because it didn't feel right on my foot, 9 was okay, but seemed really stiff and my feet didn't like them for over 20 miles. The 10s are even better than my beloved 7s. Thanks, Brooks!",
120246,5,07/21/2017,Love!! Half marathon training These shoes age great!  I was wearing brooks adrenaline gts. But I wanted something with a wider toe box! These are perfect! I also always have to size up half a size with brooks. These have plenty of cushion and are very comfortable! Love them!,
120246,2,07/21/2017,"Giving them some time to wear in to decide if I want to keep Typically wear a size 8 and bought an 8.5, seems to fit well both length and width wise. I've been running outside on pavement and inside on the treadmill, as well as doing some plyo workouts with them. Although they are comfortable to walk around in, they are a bit too cushioned for me. I feel as though I'm pushing off and not getting anywhere when I'm running and jumping.",
120246,5,07/21/2017,"A bonus for your feet! You know it's a good thing when you can instantly wear and run in your new shoes with absolutely no issues.  I really like these even more than the previous version.  Normally the colors don't cause me to love or hate my shoes, but the black with pink is especially snazzy.",
120246,4,07/20/2017,"Not bad.... I am a nurse and I am on my feet a lot throughout the day.  I am also recovering from a plantar fascitis treatment and broken toe surgery back in March of this year.  I have never owned a pair of Brooks before, but after seeing all of my nurse co-workers with at least one pair of them, I thought I would give them a try.  They are pretty comfortable.  I would have liked for them to be more 'cushiony', especially for the price.  But with that said, they are more comfortable than what I have been wearing.",
120246,5,07/20/2017,Awesome! Feel even lighter and more comfortable than the 9's Love these! Probably the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have ever owned.,
120246,5,07/19/2017,"My favorite pair of Ghost so far I wear ghosts and Glycerin. These are my new favorite. and OMGosh....the color!!!!! A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!  Finally a color that is completely neutral and modern with a little bit of an ""hombre"" look. So happy with this model ! Training for Chicago marathon ! YAY!",
120246,5,07/19/2017,"LOVE LOVE LOVE The ghost have always been my favorite shoe and the 10 lives up to that and more! Roomy toe box, super cushy insole, and laces that don't cut into your foot! Thank you Brooks!",
120246,5,07/19/2017,Ghost Is Great Again! Ghost 7 and 8 cured my feet. I couldn't wear Ghost 9 and my old 8's were getting pretty worn. I am glad I gave the Ghost 10's a chance - they feel great.,
120246,4,07/18/2017,"Love Ghost 10 Love the Ghost 10. I didn't need much break in time as I got them on a Wednesday and wore them for a few short runs before wearing them for a half marathon on Sunday. I will say they did feel a little large in the toe box area, but while running not it was not an issue. By the end of the half they were feeling pretty loose all over and my foot was sliding some. Overall, very comfortable shoe with good support. 👍",
120246,5,07/13/2017,SO NICE! I just got these and did my first run in them today. I bought them at the same time I bought the Glycerin 15 and I LOVE them both. Brooks Ghost 9 was my first Brooks shoe after moving from Asics and I have to say I really liked the 9 and I Love the 10 and the glycerin 15. So far 5 stars for all my brooks purchases!,
120246,5,07/11/2017,"So happy Ghosts are back! After wearing Brook ghosts for a couple years  and being particularly picky about the kind of shoe I can wear (plantar fasciitis issues and Mortons neuroma) ,  I was crushed when the shoe design  of the ghost nine made my feet feel very uncomfortable. With great regret, I returned my ghost nine's. Now that the ghost tens are out, I was a bit skeptical that the comfort would be back,  but it certainly has! Comfortable cushion and great fit is back!!! So happy!!! Gearing up to buy my second ghost tens soon! Keep the bright colors and patterns coming!!",
120246,5,07/11/2017,"The Shoes to run I'm a serious regular runner (I train mainly for trails but I train in a city, so I run mainly on non technical ground: forest mainly) with at least three training a week and more than 50K/week. So I need comfort more than anything else, especially since my ankle and legs were broken. These shoes provide stability and sensitivity on top of comfort. I wish I could find them more easily... They're the best compromise between all the contradictory things you want stiff suppplness, :-) it's like running with small clouds on the soles.",
120246,5,07/09/2017,"Big Wow!! I am very impressed with the Ghost 10! It feels so light and comfortable! Such a great run in these shoes! Huge improvement over the Ghost 9. I have a large bunion, and the mesh fits around the upper foot so well, without rubbing on the bunion. Great job, Brooks!!!",
120246,5,07/08/2017,"Fits Narrow Feet Well! Love the ghost 10. I have a narrow foot and the ghost 10 provides a nice stable snug fit. They fit more like ghost 8 in length. I didn't like ghost 9s at all ,but ghost 10s are a great improvement!😀",
120246,5,07/04/2017,"Running on clouds Love them! They feel very cushioned and bouncy, are very light, and need ZERO break-in time, quite different from the Ghost 9, which felt quite a bit stiffer compared to the 10. I wear them with PowerStep insoles for an added touch of arch support, and the combination feels fantastic!",
120246,5,06/27/2017,"LOVE! I've been an avid Ghost wearer for a few years now. However, I was so disappointed with Ghost 9, I ended up purchasing another Ghost 8 instead of the 9s bc I didn't like the feel. So I was hesitant to wear the Ghost 10. I'm glad I gave it a shot! Instantly felt comfortable with just the right amount of support, but not too bulky or heavy. It feels pretty light and flexible compared to past models. Love the colors and designs for 10s as well.",
120246,1,06/25/2017,"PLEASE make the Ghost model in a non-hideous color scheme!?! Oh great. Another round of ugly Brooks Ghost shoes. I wear these for walking, running, on the weekends. Basically, a lot, and I have been waiting since the Ghost 5 for a color scheme that is not hideous--e.g. not neon or mostly white or old-lady looking. The Ghost 5 had a very cute black and yellow design (citron) color scheme and that has yet to be even close to repeated. The new Brooks Calderas (black/pink) are pretty cute but I'd rather get a new pair of Brooks Ghosts...looks like I'll have to wait another year.",
120247,5,12/26/2017,"Obsessed with these shoes! Bought these shoes on a whim and I'm never looking back. I used to exclusively buy products from another running shoe company (starts with an A..) but these are by far superior. So comfortable, my feet feel like they could keep going and going! Already looking to buy my next pair, as well as try out other brooks shoes!",
120247,5,12/19/2017,"I love these shoes My second pair of these since the summer.  Not sure I got as many miles out of my first pair as I did with the 14, but way more comfy.  I wear a custom orthotics and it's a great fit.  My only issue is that I wear a 7 Wide and only one color was available.  Would be nice if those of us with wide feet had multiple color options.",
120247,5,12/16/2017,The best of the best Best sneaker I've ever owned-hands down- I overpronate and this shoe does the trick,
120247,5,12/15/2017,My favorite running shoes Favorite running shoes. Great cushion. I buy them a half size larger than my other running shoes.,
120247,5,12/14/2017,Great running shoes! ,
120247,5,12/12/2017,LOVE! I love the Glycerin line!  It's perfect for my feet and so comfy!  I walk 2 miles 3 times a week and also wear these for my job.  Perfect!,
120247,3,12/10/2017,"Very comfy but.... I bought these shoes for work as I'm on my feet 10-12 hours a day. The shoes are incredibly comfy, the most comfortable pair I own. My only complaint, which to me is a big deal, is that the shoes make my feet stink! I've worn the shoes for three days and yuck! I've never had an issue before, but I think the nylon insert and lining just force your feet to sweat. I usually wear compression socks, but I even tried my thick cotton socks and it didn't make a difference. Bummer because I spent so much money on these shoes and it's incredibly embarrassing to take them off in the locker room now. Back to wearing my new balances :-/",
120247,5,12/09/2017,I would but this product again and again ,
120247,5,12/06/2017,Only shoe I wear! I found out about Brooks Glycerin from a coworker at the gym I work at. My first shoe was the Glycerin 11and have since then purchased 3 pairs a year. My only fault with the shoe has nothing to do with fit and comfort. The problem I have is keeping the white around the bottom of the shoe white. It always looks dirty. The ones with color around bottom are not as nice looking as the white.,
120247,4,12/05/2017,"Great shoe but runs a little smaller than its predecessors I love Brooks Glycerin's, they are light and fit my foot perfectly so no breaking in period.  This is my fifth pair but these definitely run smaller in length than the other ones, width is the same.  I should have gotten a half size larger.  I am not a runner but between walking, stair master and the eliptical I average 10 miles a day.",
120247,5,12/04/2017,"Looking to get another pair! I LOVE these shoes! I work 12hr shifts in the ER. I am on my feet all day and my heels hurt! Very hard to find a shoe that can keep the comfort level ALL day, or a couple days in a row. I usually have to switch shoes from day to day, until I bought my first pair of Brooks. I have had mine for about two months now, and I am already shopping for another pair because I love wearing them so much!! Brooks you now have my loyalty!",
120247,5,12/03/2017,Will more than likely get the same shoe again! ,
120247,4,11/30/2017,"Goldilox says almost perfect I read the reviews prior to ordering this shoe and the Ghost and ordered a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear (8).  For me the shoe was a 1/2 size too big and had to slide my foot forward to get an idea of how the ball of the foot would feel and my toes.  The positives is that this is a very comfortable shoe, good looking, and the toe box is wide (B).  I wouldn't have to worry about a toe(s) going numb during a run.  However, I didn't like the feel of the interior: the padding just wasn't there for me.  Unfortunately this shoe didn't do it for me.",
120247,5,11/23/2017,Love Glycerin 15 as much as I loved Glycerin 11 I am very pleased with my Glycerin 15s.  I had several pairs of Glycerin 11 and didn't like any of the subsequent Glycerin models until the 15 came out.  They are now my favorite shoes!  I am on my second pair after having trained for and run a full marathon and a couple half marathons.  My only complaint is that I wish there were more colors to choose from.  I normally wear an 8 in running shoes (7.5 in other shoes). I got my first pair in size 8 but they felt a little short. I  sized up to 8.5 for my 2nd pair and they are now perfect.,
120247,5,11/22/2017,great shoe! ,
120247,3,11/20/2017,Did not seem robustly constructed Returned them. Other models had better reinforcement where yours wear out. Big toe area.,
120247,5,11/19/2017,"LOVE THESE SHOES! I arrived at the Las Vegas Marathon series and realized I forgot my shoes at home.  YIKES!  I reluctantly bought these at the health expo.  I didn't have the patience to get the custom fitting done as the line was long so I wasn't even sure if I needed neutral or support shoes.  Fortunately I picked the right ones!!  I was so worried about doing the 5K and 10K in new shoes.  I walk with occasional spurts of running.  I purchased a half size up. The toe box is very spacious.  My second toes did rub against the top and cause blisters but that occasionally happens in my other shoes as well.  It's always a struggle to find ones that don't.  My feet felt great after all the walking.  Well, as great as they could after 2 days of events.  I love these shoes!! so comfortable.  Brooks has a new customer for life",
120247,4,11/15/2017,"I would buy again but size up 1/2size I love these shoes. They're great on my feet for long work shifts. My only complaint is that I wish I would've went up 1/2 size, they're a little small. My previous brooks glycerin were true to size so it was a little disappointing that they were small. I wore them a couple of shifts thinking I just needed to break them in so now it's too late for an exchange :(",
120247,5,11/14/2017,LOVE these shoes I absolutely love these shoes. My feet are in constant pain so it typically prohibits me from running over 3 miles without stopping and these shoes are enabling me to exercise without pain!,
120247,4,11/13/2017,"Good long run shoe; clunky for speed work Just purchased these and the new levitate.  This shoe will be a good long run shoe, but the levitate feels far more agile.",
120247,5,11/11/2017,Love my Glycerins I use the Glycerin 15 for both running and the gym. I love the cushion and the upper is comfortable. It looks like the tie box changed just enough that I found I needed to go a half size up from normal.,
120247,5,11/10/2017,best shoe ever-glycerin I lift and weights and do some cardio but not running.....i walk outside at least twice a week as well.  This shoe really is amazing.....I can be on my feet all day and at the end of the day my feet are never hurting...has awesome support for the not so graceful ones as well,
120247,1,11/08/2017,Totally disappointed First bought the size I have worn for years in this same shoe- too small. Returned and bought 1/2 size bigger. Thought they might work so I took them for a run. About mile 5 I noticed my small toe burning  - by the end of my run I had a giant blister on that toe. Never blistered in a pair of Brooks before. Returned the shoes. Very disappointed that my go-to shoe no longer works for me. The awesome thing is Brooks return policy- though I am sad I had to take advantage.,
120247,5,11/08/2017,"Perfect running shoes I've been running for 30 years, and these are the best shoes I've ever had. For me there needs to be a balance between cushioning and weight, and these are that perfect balance - excellent cushioning for long runs, but also dont feel heavy or bulky when doing faster workouts. I run about 25 miles a week. Not a ton of miles, but enough to decide over 6 months that I love these shoes. Buying my 2nd pair today. Good to have a spare.",
120247,4,11/05/2017,"I would buy this product again I am using them strictly for running.  I am preparing for a 10K in December.  I would like a little more cushioning all over the sole of the foot, but they are so much better than the glycerins I bought 2-3 years ago.  I was completely anti Brooks but all of my friends run in them & swear by them.  A friend told me about the 90 day return policy if you buy directly from Brooks so I figured I should try them again.",
120247,5,11/03/2017,"Love them! These are my third pair of Glycerins (11, 13, 15) so I knew to go a half size up. Ran a 5k a week after I bought them without a needed ""breaking in"" period. Worth every penny!",
120247,5,10/30/2017,I am in love with these sneakers. They are amazing. ,
120247,5,10/29/2017,Very similar to previous 14s I'm a nurse and bought these for work. I previously had the glycerin 14s and they are very similar. Lots of comfort. You don't even have to break these shoes in. Will continue to buy.,
120247,5,10/29/2017,I love this shoe. I walk all day at my job and this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned.,
120247,5,10/28/2017,Love these shoes Turned to Brooks this time. I was always a ASICS  Gel Nimbus girl but the new shoe ran VERY narrow. Loved the Brooks Glycerin!!!,
120247,4,10/27/2017,nice replacement shoe I bought these to try as a switch from the ghost line and I am quite satisfied.  I have done a half marathon in these shoes and my feet were very happy!,
120247,4,10/25/2017,Great Running Shoe I have worn the Glycerin for a few years and love this shoe.  This model is running a bit small and I probably should have gone up a half size.  But other than that I still love this shoe.  It is very comfortable and I run a lot and quite a bit of distance.,
120247,5,10/24/2017,"Best shoes ever! These are the best running shoes I've ever had! If you're on the fence, just get them! You will not regret it!!#reviewsweeps",
120247,5,10/24/2017,"Best shoe ever! I absolutely love these shows, they have great support and my knees no longer hurt on long runs!",
120247,5,10/23/2017,"Love these! I made the switch from the Adrenaline's to Glycerin and I've been very pleased. I needed a little more cushion and these shoes met they need. I usually take an 8.5 in running shoes but based on other reviews I ordered a size 9. They're a prefect fit, so I'd definitely recommend going at least a half size up. #ReviewSweeps",
120247,5,10/21/2017,Been wearing and loving this running shoe for years! Have tried many running shoes and this one is by far the most comfortable and colorful!!  Love it!,
120247,4,10/21/2017,Amazing Comfort! These shoes are amazingly comfortable!  I am a nurse and I am on my feet for long periods of time and these shoes are perfect!  I just wish there were a few more color options.  These do run a bit small so I would definitely go up a half size.,
120247,5,10/20/2017,Love!! Incredibly comfortable. Great cushioning. Love the black with accent colors.,
120247,5,10/19/2017,I only wear Brooks for work. Brooks always has a high arch and fits my feet like a glove. I can always tell when it's time to buy a new pair bc when I try on Brooks adrenaline it feels so comfy. I stand on my feet a lot and these shoes really help me not be in pain after a long day.,
120247,5,10/16/2017,"The only shoes I ever want to wear. The best shoes I have ever worn. I have severe foot issues due to meds taken for a transplant, and these shoes have literally kept me active. Thank you Brooks for making such a comfortable shoe! Please DO NOT discontinue the Glycerin 15!",
120247,2,10/16/2017,"Disappointing changes As a Brooks Glycerin sneaker devotee of many years, I must say #15 is a disappointment. The toe box is no longer roomy and the length feels shorter and tighter. I will never understand why ""improvements"" are made when the #14 did not appear broken but absolutely just right!",
120247,5,10/16/2017,First marathon shoes The transition from the Brooks Ghost to the Glycerin wasn't difficult. They are both really great shoes.,
120247,4,10/13/2017,Good running shoe #ReviewSweeps     I like my Glycerine 15's. I had to return and reorder a full size larger though. I thought they would be cushier that they are but they're not bad.,
120247,5,10/11/2017,Love ❤️ the shoe and the feel ,
120247,1,10/11/2017,"Not enough support I purchased the Glycerin 15 shoes at a running store that helps you select the best shoes for your foot type (Neutral).  I had the Glycerin 9 and 10 in the past, so I felt pretty confident that I would love the 15 too.  But the 15 seem more lightweight and the sole is softer than the 9 and 10.  I ended up having severe heel pain and had to stop running.  Even just walking in the shoes gives me heel pain.  So I recently purchased the Ghost 9 thinking I would have better luck, but I am still having foot pain.  It's really disappointing that the Glycerin 15 was that much different then the predecessors.  I would love to keep running in Brooks but am at a loss for which pair to buy especially after already investing in two pair in the last 4 months.",
120247,5,10/11/2017,"Third time with these shoes! These shoes run small, I'm usually an 8 and I take a 9. I need narrow and these are perfect. Lots of cushioning and support.",
120247,5,10/10/2017,I would buy this sneaker again I purchased this sneaker on a whim and me and my knees couldn't be happier first time in a very long time my knees did not protest my 10 mile walk.  I would highly reccomend getting this a half size bigger and if you want wide know its not super wide but it still has room with a nice fit.  My only complaint is the squeaky sound the sneaker makes as you walk its like a squeaky toy is stuck inside the shoe. Very odd.,
120247,5,10/10/2017,"Great fitting shoe!!! First time I purchased Adrenaline gym shoes. I have been wearing Brooks for 17 years.   Wow, my feet feel great in them.  I have a narrow long foot.  I was amazed how comfortable these gym shoes are.  My walks and runs are great now because I don't really even feel the shoe on my feet.  Light and airy!!  Always, my only beef, is I wish Brooks would offer more color choices for us narrow feet people!!!!  Its been way too long that I only have one choice in each model.  Lets get this in action Brooks!!",
120247,5,10/09/2017,Love the new style ,
120247,5,10/09/2017,"First ""real"" running shoe First time I put my foot in I fell in love! Fits great! However... after 20 miles I noticed my 2nd toes on both feet had blisters and started to get black/hematoma under those nail beds (and no my 2nd toes are not longer than my big toes). Changed socks talked with every runner I knew to see what to do. So after 156 miles I am going to exchange for a 0.5 size up (usually a 10 going to a 10.5). I LOVE THE SHOE, I just wanted to see if I needed a little extra space (well my toe wants it.)",
120247,5,10/07/2017,"Great Shoe! I really love this shoe and will continue to buy it because it's very comfortable,  lightweight, attractive,  and helps me walk faster.",
120247,3,10/07/2017,My least favorite glycerin in the past 5-6 years Not as comfortable as glycerine 13. Feel smaller and narrower.  Also wish more colors came in wide.  Not a fan of the years wide color.,
120247,5,10/06/2017,Great running shoe I have been running in the glycerines for a few years now. I love them! This version feels lighter and the toe box is smaller then the 13 version. Can't recommend them highly enough!,
120247,1,10/05/2017,"Don't like the sizing for Glycerin 15s Loved my Glycerin 12s (womens) and was prepared to love the 15s. I normally wear a 10.5 but needed 11 in the Glycerin 12; I went up a half size per the reviews but the 11.5 was just tooooo big.  So, I dropped back to the size 11 again but that was indeed toooo small.  Thus I never got a good fit and had to return both pairs.  Wish I could still get another pair of Glycerin 12s as they are the most comfortable shoes I think I have ever worn.  Wish they hadn't changed the way the shoe is made.",
120247,5,10/05/2017,Yes I would ,
120247,4,10/05/2017,Love! I'm a college athlete and I run up to 55 miles a week and I finally found a pair of shoes that are perfect after 8 years of struggling to find the best pair for me!,
120247,5,10/04/2017,Love these running shoes! My other Brooks running shoes were worn out from too much use so I bought these and I'm so glad I did! They feel wonderful whether I'm walking or running. I have plenty of cushion and these made a big difference in how my feet feel. I would buy these again in a heartbeat!,
120247,4,10/03/2017,Comfy but a little short... Super comfy. I wear a wide width and the width is great but it rubs about a half size small in the length.,
120247,5,10/02/2017,Most comfortable shoes ever ,
120247,5,10/01/2017,Can't afford not to have my brooks shoes! I'm on my feet 9 plus hours a day on concrete I need my brooks shoes to make it through my day.,
120247,5,09/30/2017,"New runner Began running in another brand of shoe and my feet were achy and my lower back would be quite tight. With this shoe, the laces give enough for your feet to swell slightly during a run without feeling tight. My back has been in much better shape and I have been able to go on longer runs with less soreness in my joints.",
120247,5,09/30/2017,I love these sneakers! ,
120247,5,09/29/2017,"Would definately buy again Most comfortable running shoe ever with best forefoot cushion in industry! Only downside is lame colors! Dont always want pinks, aqua, and purples!",
120247,5,09/24/2017,"Simply the best for wide feet Extra heel cushioning in the 15 pushed my foot forward and caused me to need a half size larger than my usual.  I will buy next year's model earlier, as Brooks was out of the size I needed when I tried to return, and I had to buy elsewhere.  Don't hesitate! Brooks is the very best cushioned shoe I've used.",
120247,5,09/23/2017,Thank heavens for wide! ,
120247,5,09/21/2017,"Love them! I was training for a half marathon and needed a new running shoe. I previously had Brooks Revanna, and felt like they weren't the correct running shoe for me. Did my research and ended up with these. I ran 7 miles in them the first time, and expected to be sore from a new shoe. No pain, nothing! Loved them instantly. Was hesitant about spending the extra money at first, but glad I did for the extra cushion in them. Brooks thank you for giving the 90 day guarantee option, really helps to make it an easy purchase. Without the 90 day, I may not have spent the extra money on these shoes. But I am glad that I did!",
120247,5,09/20/2017,"needed to go up a size I love the glycerin 15 but I needed to go from a size 7.5 (from the glycerin 14) to 8.5. I find that the shoe is great for high arches and those prone to tendon injuries. Initially I bought the shoes in a 7.5 expecting them to be identical to the glycerin 14, my toes started cramping and my big toe went numb. The 15 seems to be more narrow in the toe region of shoe, fortunately I was able to return the 7.5 and try on both the 8 and 8.5. I would recommend trying on a few sizes.",
120247,5,09/20/2017,"I LOVE this shoe! These shoes are the most comfortable pair I have ever owned! Even my 10 yr old daughter (who only wears a 1/2 size smaller) says they feel awesome. I have not ran in them, but I am a PE teacher on my feet all day and they feel wonderful! I plan to order another pair soon.",
120247,5,09/19/2017,"I am buying again. I've been wearing Glycerin since the 12 style. Based on reviews, I purchased Glycerin 15 in half size larger & they fit perfectly. They feel so good, I'm ordering a second pair today.",
120247,1,09/19/2017,Terrible in comparison to prior Glycerin versions Not sure why the quality decreased so much.  I have been getting Glycerins for years.  This model feels flimsy and gives me terrible blisters in the front.,
120247,5,09/18/2017,"Best and Most Comfortable Fitness Shoe Ever! This is the best shoe out there.  The Rolls-Royce of running shoes.  Very comfortable for my jog to the gym as well as spin class.  I love the new color black with the pop of color pink.  I appreciate that they come already laced.  It's really the little things, it being already laced is a great service!  Perfect all around athletic shoe.  I will not buy another brand.  Nike who?",
120247,4,09/15/2017,"fantastic shoe but feels smaller this time I've been wearing the Glycerin since the 11 came out and have ordered the same size every time. After taking them out for a few weeks, I'm realizing I really need to size up. Same comfort - but feels about 1/2 size smaller.",
120247,4,09/14/2017,Yes Great cushion for fast walking and long distance.Great for people who walk more on the outside of their foot.,
120247,4,09/14/2017,"Smaller fit but same great comfort! I'm glad I read the reviews saying to size up a half size. I completely agree! I have been purchasing Glycerins since the Glycerin 11s. With each new style, the toe box seems to get smaller and smaller with the length of the shoes feeling smaller. The Glycerin 11s (purchased in a size 10) had a nice large toe box that I could easily move my toes around and could jog without problems. When I got to the Glycerin 14's in a size 10, the toe box was smaller, and I couldn't wear them to jog or workout because my toes would hit the front of the shoe. For these Glycerin 15s, I'm glad I went up to a size 10.5 as I can use these to exercise with no problem. They are a size 10.5 but feel more like a size 10.Other than that, they fit comfortably like the rest of the Glycerins, which will continue to be my go-to exercise and work shoes! I wish they would STOP making the toe box smaller though. If they don't, I may have to find a new shoe to wear!",
120247,5,09/13/2017,Loved it so much I bought a second pair After reading the reviews I bought these shoes.  They have been great for running.  They are very comfortable and fit well.,
120247,2,09/13/2017,"Missing my Glycerin 13s still... My first pair of Brooks were the Glycerin 13. At the time, I thought they were the most comfortable sneakers I'd ever owned and made me a Brooks Believer. They felt like clouds. When they finally wore out, I ordered the Glycerin 14 and returned them almost immediately after only walking around my house in them. I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong but they didn't feel the same and I knew I wouldn't like them. Fast forward to the Glycerin 15 and I thought I'd give them another try. I've worn them a few times now and am pretty disappointed. On my first wear just out and about around town running errands and driving, my big toes went numb (the shoes aren't too small). I wore them again and casually walked about 4 miles around town and my arches were aching by the time I got home, though the first couple miles were fine. I wore them to the gym later in the day and could not walk or run on the treadmill during my HIIT class because my feet were so achy. I ended up switching to the elliptical and was in major pain in my arches and the balls of my feet to the point where I almost left class early because I didn't think I could hang for the full hour. So sadly, these are going back. Though they feel quite comfortable and cushiony when you first put them on, I wouldn't really recommend them for anything but some casual shorter walks.",
120247,5,09/11/2017,My wife's second pair of Glycerin. She loves it. ,
120247,5,09/10/2017,Absolutely love this shoe! I'm training for a marathon right now and wouldn't have any other shoe for the longer runs. I absolutely love these shoes.,
120247,5,09/09/2017,"Love my new shoes I walk a lot. Running is out of the question, as I have a knee replacement. I count on comfort so that I can be on my feet most of the day. These shoes allow me to accomplish all the tasks of the day.",
120247,5,09/08/2017,"Absolutely, I would buy this shoe again! Treadmill use 6 days a week and for outdoor walking. I am going to order a second pair for casual dress wear, so I can interchange shoes.",
120247,5,09/07/2017,I would buy them again ,
120247,5,09/04/2017,Yes great shoe Use for trail running and boot camp work outs at the gym. Good shoe for both.,
120247,3,08/31/2017,"Somewhat disappointed... I am a long time Glycerin lover. I am very disappointed in the fact that my forefoot slides around in them no matter no tightly I lace them.  When I'm walking, it's a problem sometimes.  When I hike, do Zumba, etc., the front of my foot slides around.  I'm going to save these for work and try to find a different pair to exercise in.  I wear a wide shoe, so it fits the rest of my foot perfectly.  I'm used the entire Glycerin fitting my foot like a glove.",
120247,5,08/29/2017,I love these shoes this is a very stable shoe. It keeps me from rolling my foot when I get tired,
120247,5,08/29/2017,LOVE...LOVE...LOVE These offer the best support and comfort for multiple reasons. I have never found a shoe this supportive and like walking on clouds.,
120247,5,08/28/2017,LOVE THIS SHOE I was wearing Nike for YEARS. And now my Nikes are sitting in the closet. I don't wear anything else to workout in. Great for every day wear and workouts. I highly recommend this pair of shoes!,
120247,5,08/28/2017,"Love this one! I like this Glycerin 15 better than the past ones. I have 2 pair of 13s , Ghost 9, Transend 4s. I don't know why the Transend costs $10 more,  it's not nearly the shoe the Glycerin is. This Glycerin 15 has cushion, stability, and a good arch support for my very high arches.",
120247,5,08/25/2017,"Great shoes, worth the price. I love the Brooks Glycerins. This is my fourth pair and the 15s are the best yet. The shoes are really comfortable. I find that I don't get blisters even after running 10+ miles in them. They are expensive shoes but they are well worth the price for how good you feel running in them.",
120247,5,08/25/2017,"Wonderful shoe. Attractive, well made, comfortable. Loved the glycerin 15 - sooooo comfortable, and very  good looking. Runs very small. I am a 7-7 1/2 W in regular shoes. Ordered 8 1/2 D. Too small. Returned, will order 9 D.",
120247,5,08/25/2017,better than the glycerin 13's!!!! ,
120247,5,08/24/2017,"These shoes are heaven! Brooks Glycerin's have been on my feet for many years. This new Glycerin is absolutely the best. I walk over 5 miles a day, every step is solid and light even though I have a heavy foot. I am also an art teacher always on my feet and my Brooks are on them making my day so comfortable. Unfortunately they only make the Glycerin's wide in only one color. I love my Brooks!",
120247,5,08/22/2017,"Love at first site and walk. I have been wearing this shoe for 4 years. Absolutely the best! Every year I buy a new pair. The 15 series is by far better than previous years in regard to cushioning. They feel like I am walking on air. I am 77 yrs old and strive for 10,000 steps per day. Walking with joy!",
120247,5,08/21/2017,"Third pair of Glycerins, third time satisfied This is my third pair of Glycerins, and again I'm really pleased with the fit and comfort. The blue/purple/teal color scheme I bought is great for transitioning into fall.",
120247,4,08/17/2017,"Maybe Very comfortable and breathable material, super light and good looking shoe, but it runs short and narrow. I wear a size 7.5 in tennis and got both the 7.5 and 8 size Wide. I like how my feet look with the 7.5, but I'm most comfortable with the size 8.",
120247,4,08/16/2017,"Love this shoe, but the 15 feels smaller in the toe bed. This is my 6th pair and happy with the shoe again. I would caution that it feels a bit smaller/narrow in the toe. I had to come up 1/2 size this time.",
120247,2,08/16/2017,"Too short These are too short (size 12N) and half size up is not available. Also, cushioning is important because I have pain but the shape of this ball of foot padding caused my toes to fall asleep.",
120247,5,08/14/2017,I would buy this shoe again  I love  it I have bad feet and work on them all day. I like to take a 2-5 mile walk as often as I can. These are the best shoes ever . And they are so cute .Thank you Brooks,
120247,5,08/12/2017,"go to shoe/size up version 15 my go to running shoe! this us my 8th pair of glycerin for running.  I ordered online my usual size 8.  I need to return for a half size larger because my great toe is touching the end of the shoe.  this is a first I've had to size up in these shoes.  I still recommend, I just suggest trying on before you purchase.",
120247,5,08/11/2017,"Comfortable shoes, many compliments I no longer run, but I'm in the gym for upwards of 5 hours a day (I'm a personal trainer) and I'm very happy with the comfort of these shoes. Additionally, I get a lot of compliments on them.",
120247,5,08/11/2017,"Buy it! I am glad I purchased the Glycerin 15 rather than the on sale 14.  The 15 has better cushioning, better breathability and gives a great run.  Get the 15 - you won't be disappointed.",
120247,5,08/11/2017,Best shoes I have worn Brooks Glycerin for over 3 years and these are very comfortable and supportive shoes!,
120247,3,08/08/2017,"Glycerin is my shoe not #15 I have been ruining in Brooks Glycerin for over 8 years, this is the first pair going back after 1.6 miles sore toe the toe box is  to straight on inner foot no big toe room sore right knee, it felt like with my big toes pushed in my foot wanted to turn inward? Never had this problem with brooks, no energy in this shoe, less support... Now I have to go shopping or hope you give some shape to the next shoe my inner foot is not straight??? I want a little bounce (energy) in my shoe.... Come on #16 give me some shape and support!",
120247,5,08/07/2017,"I love the Glycerin! I used to work in the hospital where I was on my feet all day. This shoe was my life saver & now I reorder the Glycerin every year! Super comfy like your walking on clouds, but light weight. I can tell it adds a pep to my step!",
120247,5,08/07/2017,"Fantastic shoe! Provides nice cushion, support, is comfy! I had to return my original pair and order a half size up.   Great shoe for running on the roads when you need to do you moderate to high mileage.",
120247,5,08/06/2017,These r the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned a ,
120247,5,08/06/2017,"Heaven!! Words cannot describe these shoes properly! I have the 14's as well and, though comfortable, there is a vast difference between the 14's and 15's! I literally cannot feel the ground when wearing these shoes; and paired with the glycerine socks.......it's like walking in pillows! I absolutely love these shoes!",
120247,5,08/05/2017,Glycerin ,
120247,5,08/03/2017,"Love my Brooks! I am 74 yrs. young and walk most days. These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I ever had, I feel like I am floating on air. I would recommend these to active seniors ,",
120247,5,08/03/2017,"Exceptional every time I run exclusively in Glycerins. My feet widen when they swell, and the 8.5 wide accommodates perfectly. I buy a pair every year, sometimes twice a year if I am running a lot.",
120247,2,08/01/2017,"Strange fabric inside shoe I've been a big fan of the glycerin for several years, but this version lost me. The shoe itself is incredibly comfortable and the wider toe box is much more roomy, which is the reason for the 2 stars. But the first time wearing them I wondered why my pinkie toe was irritated and when I looked inside, there is a strange piece of fabric that ends right where the toe lays. And the fabric can tend to bunch a little since it isn't stitched down and it just creates another unnecessary inner layer. I don't see any reason why the fabric is there but I hope it is taken out in the 16's. I'll be returning these and sticking to my stockpiled 13s until this issue is no more.",
120247,5,07/31/2017,Out of ten pairs this is Mu favorite Brooks style so far! ,
120247,5,07/31/2017,My new running shoe! I was a committed Asics lover but went in the shoe store looking for something new. I have wide feet and thought I really needed super padded running shoes. Once I tried them off I never wanted to take them off. Left the store wearing these!! They are nice and wide in the toe box and the top fabric has enough give so my toes don't hurt anymore. I just love these shoes!!,
120247,5,07/29/2017,"Finally Relief Over the last year and a half I have been trying to step up my walking/running game but found myself struggling with shin splints the whole time. I went through 3 other styles of brooks which I really did love in the short term but found that I was still in a lot of pain during my workouts. Finally I decided to try the Glycerins and it was love at first wear. Seriously, after pretty much the first workout in the my shins have calmed down and I have finally been able to put miles in without feeling like I want to cry, curse or cut my legs off.",
120247,5,07/29/2017,"These.are.the.best.shoes.ever!!! Great for running.  This is my fourth pair of brooks glycerine, and might be best ones yet...so cushy and comfortable straight out of the box!  The only negative is that they don't seem to last as long as some other running shoes.  I replace them every 6 months or about 350 miles for me.",
120247,5,07/28/2017,Very supportive and comfortable run! I need supportive running shoes and these fit the bill. I had to return for half size bigger but other than that I love them.,
120247,3,07/27/2017,"They fit but..... These don't work for me. I have a heel spur on my left foot and though it sounds weird, these shoes are *too* cushiony and bouncy. I wore them running errands and can already tell that the heel is feeling irritated. I know my foot and what will irritate it and what won't. They are very comfortable, fit well, and feel great on my right foot. They even fit with my prescription orthotics, which is unusual. I need cushioning and support but not *very* cushiony *and* bouncy, which is how these shoes seem to be. Ordinarily I wear Merrells but wanted to try something different. I looks like I will stick with Merrells.",
120247,5,07/26/2017,100% love them I absolutely love my glycerin 15.   I've been exclusively running trails for 2 years so my shoe of choice was the cascade.  but since I'm training for a road race I am wearing my glycerin 15.  love them.  Brooks never disappoints.,
120247,5,07/26/2017,My new Favorite! I absolutely love my new Glycerin's.  Brooks nailed it with just the right amount of cushion without the weight of the previous Glycerin's.,
120247,5,07/25/2017,I would buy this again! Wonderful shoes! ,
120247,5,07/24/2017,AWESOME ,
120247,5,07/24/2017,I would absolutely buy these again These shoes are so comfortable. I have been running in Brooks Adrenaline for years and the newest version didn't fit my foot quite as well. These shoes were much lighter and more cushiony.  I love them!,
120247,5,07/22/2017,Super duper ,
120247,5,07/22/2017,"Comfortable,Cushioned,Correct to size,Complements your run The only thing I would recommend to change is the weight. I like a lighter weight shoe. Other than that, its perfect and the size is true! Don't be persuaded in going with what the foot doctor may suggest as in going a half size larger. I did and returned ""big foot"" and got my normal size. Awesome shoe! Colors are splendid as well.",
120247,5,07/21/2017,The most comfortable sneaker ever! Just started fitness walking and was looking for a shoe that was comfortable and supportive with room in the toe box. This shoe checked off all of my requirements.  Feels like I am walking on clouds. Super comfortable!!  Fantastic support throughout my foot.  I have raved about these to all my friends and will absolutely buy these again!!!,
120247,5,07/20/2017,"Fit, Function, Comfort...All FIRST RATE!!! Ordered the shoes for an ultralight backpacking trip in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana.  This trip had me carrying a 23 pound pack about 22 miles in the backcountry that took us up and over a mountain pass.  All possible surfaces were traversed, to include snow, rocks, mud and water.  The shoes performed very well all around, though the grip wasn't ideal for cross traversing mountain-packed snow, but what running shoe is?  The amount of all over cushioning throughout the shoe was great!  Although time in the shoes was limited prior to the trip, not ONE hot spot or blister took place over the course of my hike.  As suggested by several, I ordered a half size up from my normal 6.5.  While the shoes visually appeared very long on my feet, the half size up idea worked out fabulously!!!  I highly recommend this shoe!!!!",
120247,5,07/19/2017,Love them I'm a nurse and on my feet for 12+ hrs during a shift. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever purchased. I feel like I'm not wearing shoes. Love them!,
120247,5,07/19/2017,Best sneakers ,
120247,5,07/18/2017,"Love this model, thumbs up Brooks! Love running in these from the get-go.  Lighter than last year's model.  Nice cushion and fits my hobbitt feet great. Great color combo in the wide width, keep em coming like this!",
120247,5,07/18/2017,"Great shoes I love Glycerin shoes, and this new model is wonderful.  My only compliants are that with sizing I already have gone half to full size up.  Meaning I used to wear a 9.5 or maybe 10 in most shoes, and on previous glycerin models had to transition to a 10.5.  This shoe, I ordered a 10.5 which seems appropriate for my big toe length, however, my fourth toe (which runs long) is hitting the shoe.  Therefore, I feel like I either need a wide version or maybe to move up in size again....to an 11, which just blows my mind.  Certainly, my feet haven't changed that much!?!  Otherwise, the shoe is awesome.",
120247,5,07/18/2017,Love my Glycerin 15 ,
120247,5,07/18/2017,Brooks shoes I love my shoes so much that after I did a 5K I had to go back to the store and buy another pair ! My knees weren't killing me and my ankles weren't hurting me . I think I found the TREASURE !!!,
120247,4,07/17/2017,"I'd rebuy these I run an average of 50 miles a week in these shoes. I love them, they're very comfortable. Although they feel nothing like the old glycerins.",
120247,5,07/17/2017,Nice pair of shoes ,
120247,5,07/16/2017,My favorite pair so far. ,
120247,5,07/15/2017,I love these shoes!!! I'm just getting back to running after a few years. My Glycerin's are definitely making it more enjoyable!!,
120247,5,07/14/2017,New Shoes...yippee! ,
120247,4,07/12/2017,"I would probably buy this again. After several months of running, I always break through the shoe where my big toes are.  The size is right, I just wish the ""leather"" part came back a bit farther on the shoe.",
120247,5,07/11/2017,"Soft as clouds From the moment I took these out of the box and onto my feet  there waS instant comfort, and perfection. They hugged my feet, and yet the softness made me feel I was walking on a spring loaded platform.",
120247,5,07/11/2017,LOVE THESE!! I just got these and ran in them for the first time today. My workout was a mixed of easy pace and speed. These are sooo comfortable. They felt soft and comfortable and did not feel like new shoes at all. My run was 6.5 miles today. This is my first time trying the Glycerin. I was religious to Asics Nimbus until the update gave me so much trouble and I started to look at other options and I do have the Ghost 9 and I did like those as well but these Glycerin are amazing! Definitely a win here.,
120247,5,07/11/2017,"Most comfortable running shoes I've ever had These shoes have been perfect for my daily walks and runs as well as for completing errands. They are supportive for my flat feet, lightweight, and just so comfortable I can wear them all day with no problem!",
120247,5,07/10/2017,"Best Glycerins yet! I started with Glycerin 10s and the 15 is best yet.  Did a 4 mile race after a very mild break in period and they felt as if I'd been running in them for months.  Lots of cushioning in the heel, wider toe box and overall a very comfortable shoe.",
120247,2,07/10/2017,Don't like ,
120247,5,07/09/2017,Absolutely Love these shoes! Training for a half marathon. Love the cushion the shoe gives when running on road.,
120247,2,07/09/2017,"The interior fit is different from past versions After  wearing two times, my foot is slipping inside these. This my fifth pair of Glycerines, I have never had this happen before.",
120247,5,07/08/2017,"Love the 15s!!! I only wear Brooks and I only wear the Glycerin.    Absolutely love my new 15s.  Perfect fit from Day 1.  I do wish, tho, that there were many more color choices.",
120247,5,07/07/2017,I would and have already purchased two pairs ,
120247,5,07/06/2017,Love this shoe! I have been running in Glycerin's since I started running 5 years ago.  Took up running later in life so cushion and performance were important in my choice of shoe.  I was wearing Ghosts and after a stress fracture my ortho suggested the Glycerin's.  I run 35-40 miles a week and these new 15's make it smooth and easy!  There are my go to shoe!,
120247,5,07/06/2017,This shoes are the ONE This are my new favorite. I absolutely LOVE the new colors too!I recommend to go a size or size and a half bigger. I use size 8 on reg shoes and I buy 9.5 on Brooks.Great cushioning and the top material is so very comfortable.,
120247,5,07/05/2017,"Love these shoes, so comfortable! ",
120247,3,07/04/2017,"Glycerin 15 fit completely different than older models I have been a HUGE glycerin fan for a few years now. 14s fit great, loved them & ordered 2 pairs. I'm a fitness instructor & also love to run so I wear shoes out very quickly. I was thrilled about the 15 launch & order 2 pairs of my normal size (8.5m) back in April. I finally received them a few weeks ago & I was totally disappointed when they were too short in length. I returned them & exchanged them for a 9.... Still way too short! What's the deal?!? The 14 fit great & the 15 is so small! I'm just so irritated, now I don't have shoes to run in!!",
120247,5,07/04/2017,My favorite of all brands ,
120247,5,07/03/2017,"Yes Love the feel of the shoes when I run, have plenty of cushioning, feel very light but still get the support I need!",
120247,5,07/02/2017,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn!!! I have high arches & other health issues that make finding comfortable shoes difficult to find. Last year I bought the Glycerin 14 on vacation. I have absolutely worn them out, and I almost ordered them again because I knew how much I loved them. But I read a lot of reviews about how the Glycerin 15 were even more comfortable, so I decided to try them first. I'm glad I did. I didn't think they could possibly be more comfortable, but they are! Try them. You will love them!",
120247,1,07/02/2017,"Want to love them but can't I order these every year in the same size, narrow and 9 1/2. This year they fit too snug and gave me blisters on the bottom of my feet. I returned them and go regular width. My foot swam in them. I will be returning them also. I am so disappointed.",
120247,5,06/30/2017,"Super comfortable! I run about 5 miles per day, neutral feet, nothing special needed, so these are perfect for me - they provide lots of cushion and they feel very plush. I previously ran only in Brooks Ghost and several years ago switched to the Glycerin. The Glycerin 15 is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!",
120247,5,06/30/2017,The best These are the most comfortable shoes I have. My foot is wide in front and narrow at the heel. I bought a wide width. Super cushion for running.,
120247,5,06/30/2017,Great running/working out shoe This will be my fourth pair of Glycerin.  Before I would have constant foot pain which turned into planters.  Since working out in these shoe I haven't had a problem yet.. Love them.. Glad they gave us more colors to choose from.,
120247,5,06/30/2017,"Love these shoes for running on pavement Most comfortable!! My third pair of Brooks and I still love them! I have been wearing a 7.5 for years - running shoes and all other. This is the first time I had to go up a half size. Which was no big deal with the free shipping and returns. I wore the 7.5 once and knew I needed a larger size, I ordered them, they came in 2 days and I was back at it.",
120247,5,06/30/2017,"Always a good shoe. This shoe appears to have more room in the toe box area, for my narrow feet I don't like it, but it's an excellent shoe with a nice ride. Looks good too.",
120247,5,06/30/2017,"I LOVE these shoes!  Most comfortable running shoes ever! I don't run but I walk a lot and also walk on a treadmill.  These shoes are so comfortable and lightweight, they are amazing.",
120247,5,06/29/2017,"Absolutely THE Best Shoes! I started with Ghost 6, which I loved. Then our local running store had a big sale on Glycerin 14's. Tried them on and they immediately trumped the Ghosts. THEN I asked what the difference was between the 14's and 15's...as soon as I tried on the Glycerin 15's, I fell in love! I still wear the Ghosts every once in a while, as well as the Glycerin 14's, but my Glycerin 15's are my definite favorite go-to shoes, about 95% of the time! A GREAT shoe -- and, I bought a size 7 (my regular size) and they are perfect...didn't need to go up half-a size as suggested by Brooks.",
120247,5,06/28/2017,The Brooks' Glycerin 15  is a great running shoe!! You made some great improvements to the 15. I have very happy feet!!  I would definitely recommend this shoe.,
120247,5,06/28/2017,"My new favorite running shoe! By far, my favorite shoe by Brooks.  It is ultimate cushion without the weight that the older Glycerin's had in the bottom.  Great Job Brooks!",
120247,5,06/27/2017,"Sticking with these! I have a narrow foot and like Brooks because there's usually at least one shoe in the style that comes in 2A.  The only negative is that the narrow shoes are limited to one color, and that's usually the ugliest color. So be it!  I ran in glycerines before and never realized what I was missing until I switched to another brand.   Guess what....I switched back to the glycerine. I'm 57 and have been running for 7 years and this is the best shoe ever.  The older I get the more I appreciate the cushion/plushness and smoothness of this shoe.  I always wear one size larger than my street shoes, so I suggest ordering one size up.  I ran cross country and track in high school in the 70's and we were issued brooks running shoes back then.  I always had to tie mine so tight because of the width.  Thanks for the narrow width. Please poll the running community for future colors!",
120247,5,06/25/2017,"The most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned I wear a 10 in dress shoes, which means I take a 10.5 in gym shoes.  Unfortunately, virtually no one makes a 10.5 and my choices were shoes that were too tight and those that my foot slid around in.  Thank goodness for Brooks.  Not only do these shoes fit, its like walking on a cloud.  Definitely the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned",
120247,5,06/25/2017,"Finally love Glycerins again! I loved the Glycerin 11s (had multiple pairs) for running but was not a fan of the 12, 13 or 14.  I am very pleased to like the with Glycerin 15s I got last month.  I find them very comfortable.  I do find them to run a bit short though.  I usually wear size 8 in running shoes and I got these in an 8 too.  I am sure at some point I will be buying another pair of these shoes and will be getting them in an 8.5. I will be avoiding running downhill until then.",
120247,3,06/24/2017,"yes I use these shoes to run,walk,work and workout.  They have gotten progressively less comfortable since the 11's.  The look of the shoe has gotten cheaper with the screened on Brooks logo and you need to go back to the great colors you used to have. I have 14 pairs of Brooks and have been disappointed with the releases the last couple of years. Please go back to the old Brooks styles and makes",
120247,5,06/24/2017,"Order half size up These were my fifth pair of Glycerin, won't wear anything else. However, I had to return and reorder a half size up from the previous four pair I own. They felt very short and my toes were touching/rubbing against the end of the shoes. Other than that, they are fabulous.",
120247,5,06/23/2017,Love Them! I run on a flat trail about 20 to 25 miles a week. My favorite were the Glycerin 11 and I tried a bunch of the ones in between including the Ghost and have never been happy and went back to my 11s. They finally were just too worn to continue so I caved and bought these new  glycerine. I absolutely love them! They are the perfect amount of cushioning and breathable. And the fit is back to what I like and need. I am super pleased!,
120247,1,06/23/2017,"Too small Please create larger sizes for women. I wear size 12 and now the sizing seems a half size smaller? Brooks does not make a size 12.5 or 13 in women's and the men's size is too wide. It's saddening that women with large feet have such a difficult time finding shoes. In addition, the colors of your shoes are not wonderful. I like when the sole and outsole are colorful --shows less dirt and is more aesthetically powerful.",
120247,1,06/23/2017,"Sizing has changed! Extremely disappointed that I can no longer wear Brooks running shoes because your ""size 12"" is actually a size 11.5. The men size is too wide. I just bought a pair of Adidas energy boost in men's size 10 because they are narrow and I will continue to buy them. Brooks you have lost a very loyal customer --I buy like 5 running shoes a year!",
120247,5,06/22/2017,This is my go to shoe! Absolutely love this shoe! The color options are the only downfall. This is my 5th pair.,
120247,4,06/22/2017,"I definitely will by these shoes again! 😊 I bought both glycerin 15 in men's and women's  and both fit comfortly. There is more cushion and I feel like I'm walking on air. The glycerin shoe whether its men's/women's seem to last me the longest of any other Brooks running shoe and I definitely get a full 400 miles per par of shoes. I have rheumatoid arthritis and the cushion in these shoes allow me to exercise and gain my life back, keeping my pain levels down. I uses to be a Nike fan, but my back and and joints were always hurting, now its Brooks Glycerin's from now on!",
120247,4,06/22/2017,Great shoe for wide feet. Light. Went half size up. ,
120247,5,06/21/2017,So comfy! Took the new kicks for a spin today and wow! who knew a cushion shoe could perform so well. I got the cactus flower color and they are a bit brighter than I thought they would be.,
120247,3,06/21/2017,"Totally different shoe! I love the Glycerin! I have been running in this shoe faithfully since the 12. Every year I order, not one, but 2 pairs. I wear at 10.5 2A (narrow), since narrows are so hard to come by after February I order two of the same shoe every June. This year, I was so excited to get the 15- wow was it different. Did you change it? I just went to my faithful running store today and I have to order an 11 2A. I just hope hope the 11 works for me I don't want to have to find another shoe I love. Go up an 1/2 a size if you are ordering!",
120247,1,06/20/2017,"THe Glycerin 15 is too short I depend on this shoe, and this new style (#15) is way too short.  Go back to the correct length that we depend on!",
120247,5,06/18/2017,"I would definitely buy this product again, but size up. I have run in Brook glycerin for years. Took the 15's out for my first run after purchasing them and felt my big toe hitting the toe box. I have always run in a size 7, but am returning the size 7 for a 7.5. Just placed that order. Other than that great great cushioning and feel light compared to the previous gyercins. Other than running small I would rate these a 5",
120247,5,06/15/2017,Great shoe! Great shoe! Very comfortable and makes for a smooth run. I think this is the best Glycerin since the 12. Upper is very flexible and fits right to my foot. Tongue is nicely padded and very comfortable.,
120247,5,06/14/2017,So comfortable! Love my new Glycerin 15 shoes but wish I had waited a week and gotten a free bag. I always order my family's shoes on the Brooks website! Great service!,
120247,4,06/11/2017,"Sizing different than previous Brooks My usual shoe size (pumps, sandals) is 8.5. So I size up to 9 in Brooks and many other running shoes. The size 9 in the new glycerin has my toe pushing against the front of the shoe standing still. But they are light, cushioned and super comfortable otherwise. Am awaiting a 9.5 to arrive to replace.",
120247,5,06/10/2017,"Improved version--great return and comfort I pre-ordered these after being in love with the v.14. The day this version came, I was just on the way out the door for my 5 mile easy run, and I sat right down to try these on.  I have had Glycerine for a only a short while, starting with the v.12 shoe and skipped right up to the 14, loving those. Even with my positive history with this shoe, I was still so surprised when I stood up in these new v.15 shoes. WOW!.  First thing I noticed was that these are not (slightly) narrow like the v.14s are, they are nice and roomy especially in the toe box. The cushion was even more substantial than the 14 which surprised me. My v.14 shoes have almost 200 miles on them and still feel fabulous and don't feel worn down at all.I decided to walk around in the new ones a bit to see how they felt. Because v.15 is slightly roomier,  I tightened the shoelaces a bit - something I NEVER do. That made this version 15 feel great. Then I went for my run!  Yeah, I know, you're not supposed to run in brand new shoes but hey! these are Brooks and these are Glycerine. So I did, with no regrets whatsoever! Great run, no issues, great return. Gave my feet and legs energy, every step felt fabulous. I wore them a while afterwards for recovery, noticing how my feet felt.I started wearing the v.14 shoes after I incurred a slight stress fracture. I had heard that the Glycerine was more cushy than other brands. I had the Transcend which I loved, but for that particular discomfort, the Transcend wasn't soft enough to help my foot, so I tried Glycerine just to see. I healed in them. Now I go back and forth between the two, but my main shoe is now the Glycerine. I have 4 pair, and this new v.15 is amazing. Just to qualify my statement, I am a casual runner, about 60-75 miles a month. I am over 50, and run mainly on the road, though in bad weather I do use a treadmill. The mileage I get on my other Glycerines so far have been about 350 miles before they need to be retired to car-washing shoes.",
120247,5,06/06/2017,"love. I went to a shoe store and had them fit me for shoes (which I haven't done in ages), so size felt fine. I have never had a pair of shoes that immediately felt this good.",
120248,5,12/25/2017,"Best shoes ever!!! Incredible grip/traction on a wide variety of surfaces, super comfortable, holds your foot securely, feels like they were made for my feet. No break in period needed. I'm super picky and have heels that ALWAYS get blisters. Not so with these shoes. Great quality. Couldn't recommend them more. Wish they came in extra wide for family members who want them.",
120248,5,12/20/2017,great shoes I'm a hiker and am NOT a fan of the stiffness or thickness traditional hiking shoes have. I bought the grit style in early summer 2016 and hiked well over 200 miles in these shoes. They're positively incredible. I only retired them because I wore them so much I wore them out!I LOVE BROOKS.,
120248,4,11/03/2017,"Light trail shoe Loved the last season and found these two small, had to return.   This only comes in one color and no narrow option.",
120248,3,10/08/2017,"Too Small I've been wearing Brooks for many many years and have always gotten the same size. A couple years ago I started running in the PureGrit and my normal size was still perfect, but the 6 is much too small and too narrow (despite having a narrow foot). I'm going to try ordering a half size up and hope I love them!",
120248,5,09/08/2017,"Best Grits Yet! These Grits are comfortable and super light while still providing everything needed for rocky, technical trails.  I love them!!",
120248,5,07/20/2017,"Love!  Thanks for widening the toe box a bit :) Loved the 3's didn't like the 4's or 5's, love the 6's!! Don't run as narrow.  Do order a 1/2 size up.",
120249,5,12/23/2017,Comfy and great colors So far this shoe has been really comfortable to run in a few times a week. The blue color was exactly as expected.,
120249,5,12/18/2017,loved it! ,
120249,4,12/15/2017,"So far, so good! ",
120249,5,12/07/2017,"Very comfortable! Very cushiony shoe. It's comfortable to me, but if you're looking for support I'd keep this in mind.",
120249,2,12/06/2017,"Would not recommend I love Brooks shoes for running and have remained loyal to the brand since my very first pair. I usually run in Ghost but decided to change things up this time. I purchased these on Friday through a Finishline in my hometown so I could try them on and see how they fit. By Wednesday of the following week they have already begun to tear. Although I do run everyday, the quality of Brooks are made to withstand the activity. I do a mixture of road running and treadmill. I will not be purchasing again.",
120249,5,12/05/2017,Recommend! ,
120249,5,12/03/2017,"Nice for soft ground I haven't worn these much but took them out a couple times over a grassy trail and they were comfortable and responsive. It's a stiffer feel than the Ghost or Launch, but the cushion levels that out. Great price on this shoe and I love the street look. My favorite thing about Brooks is reliability in sizing, and this shoe is no exception.",
120249,5,12/02/2017,Good Shoe! The top is flexible allowing for foot deformation!  Great shoe for older gals!,
120249,5,12/01/2017,This is my third pair. Love them ,
120249,5,12/01/2017,Comfortable shoes ,
120249,5,12/01/2017,I would buy again. Feet hurt after walking due to already existing feet problems. I ordered new inserts. Hopefully this will take care of the feet pain.,
120249,4,11/30/2017,"Half size too big, would love to try again I ordered these in hopes of finding a longer distance shoe but they were too big when I received them and felt too heavy. I would love to order these again in the correct size.  I am normally a 7 in Brooks so I'd try the 6.5.  I am probably going to hold off though since I just ordered the levitate's and they seem to fit more of what I was looking for.  Love the style though!",
120249,5,11/28/2017,"First time Brooks customer I went to buy new sneakers and have ALWAYS purchased a different brand that has a swoosh logo on it.  As I was trying on various models, the salesman brought me the Brooks Revel to try.  I looked at him puzzled and he said to trust him.  My feet felt better supported and the comfort was noticeably different from the other brand...and I was quickly sold. ((I did buy a half size bigger than what I normally get with the other brand.)) I worked out in them that night and noticed a positive difference in how my feet and legs felt.  Glad to be a new member of the Brooks family!",
120249,5,11/27/2017,"This has become my new favorite cardio workout shoe! I'm no spring chicken and lately my knees and hips became bothersome after my normal cardio workouts.  My feet and legs feels much better and I have more ""bounce"" in class.  I swear it's these new sneakers!",
120249,3,11/20/2017,"Not a Ghost for sure. I bought these shoes thinking the comfort level would be equivalent to the Ghost. Not so. I can't quite figure out why. But, my feet cramp and my Achilles heel hurts after wearing these shoes.",
120249,1,11/20/2017,"I'm done with Brooks! My wife and I were long time Brooks buyers... Brooks are comfortable but after 2 1/2 weeks of walking and light running (less than 15 miles spread across 3 other pairs of shoes) her brand new pair of $100+ Revels have a sizable hole in the collar.  This isn't the first time its happened.  Last pair of Ravenna's she had a ""wear"" hole on the side after 3 weeks.  Chalked those up to a fluke but twice in a row... really?  Contacted Brooks and their response was so sad too bad.   They said made the collar softer for those who run without socks.  That's fine but shoe should last longer than a month, don't you think.  Sorry Brooks but horrible customer service and poor quality craftsmanship.",
120249,4,11/17/2017,love these shoes but material was ripping I really really love these shoes for running and I'm a CNA so I wear them to work as well. But.... The first day I wore them running they started ripping by the shoe lace hole and now they are fully ripped around the rim of the shoe.,
120249,5,11/15/2017,LOVE this shoe ,
120249,5,11/12/2017,"I love these shoes.  I have  planter fasciitis,  comfortable Started excercising  and these  shoes  are  wonderful. I have alot of foot problems.  These  are great.",
120249,5,11/11/2017,Very comfortable out of the box. Didn't even need to use my orthotics in these shoes. They did great with my plantar fascitis.,
120249,5,11/11/2017,👌 perfect ,
120249,4,11/11/2017,"Love the shoe! Wish I️ bought half size smaller. Road runs. 3-6 miles, 4/5 times a week. First time buying Brooks in a while and I️ love the shoe but unfortunately it's a bit too big.",
120249,4,11/09/2017,Small ,
120249,5,11/07/2017,"BEST RUNNING SHOE EVER The shoe does feel a half size too big, but I did want that.  I like having room in the toe box for my foot to move around.  These sneakers are super light and breathable.  They have a nice achilles guard, great arch support and are comfortable on impact, nice cushioning.  I will  buy this shoe again and again.",
120249,5,11/04/2017,"Great for 12 hour days! I bought these after limping home from work every day in the hospital (12 hour days). Since buying these, I've had little to no feet pain. I am so happy with these!!",
120249,5,11/03/2017,"It's like running in socks! My new Revels are so cozy that I feel like I'm running in socks!  I have foot issues (bunion), but have no discomfort while running in these shoes,  I can now focus on my run instead of my feet.  I buy a half size up for a little extra room.  Thank you Brooks for this new model!",
120249,5,11/02/2017,"Perfect for what I bought it for, and more I bought these shoes for my daily 3 1/2 mile walks. They're comfortable, supportive, and fit perfectly, which is really important when you're buying something online. They feel like they'd be great to run in too, but I unfortunately can't run right now due to a minor hip injury. I would recommend these shoes to anybody who needs a good, reliable pair of shoes.#ReviewSweeps",
120249,5,11/01/2017,Would buy again and again! ,

120249,5,10/31/2017,I would buy this again! Love! I went from the Launch to these and although I was worried about the differences I am LOVING them!!,
120249,5,10/25/2017,Great if looking for cushion. I buy running shoes because of neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. This is my first pair of Brooks.,
120249,5,10/24/2017,Love this shoe very comfortable. I wear a Size six but I took a half size bigger. Very comfortable love them!,
120249,4,10/24/2017,"Great value running shoes These shoes are a step up from my Nike Zoom Pegasus pair. They have more cushioning, more arch support, but without the weight or ""clown shoe"" qualities that can come from other pairs providing those things. They could probably be more cushioned and more supportive, but for the price these are a total bargain.",
120249,2,10/23/2017,"Poor quality Love the comfort and design of this shoe but it is horrible quality. The material right before the holes for the laces has completely ripped on both shoes after uses for less than a month of running. Now that they are ripped there is no cushion and the plastic of the shoe rubs, and I can no longer wear them.",
120249,5,10/23/2017,"Love at first run These were so comfortable the first time I took them out. The back is a bit rigid, so walking seems to be taking some time to wear them in, but for runs, you don't even notice it. The width is fantastic. Nothing rubs on the inside against my arch like some others I've tried that seem to only have a wide toe box. Usually I size up 1/2 size in Brooks, but these I probably could have gone with my normal sizing. Still fit great. I just wear my thicker running socks with them. I would definitely recommend. I'm so glad I tried these.",
120249,5,10/22/2017,Amazing shoe! Amazing comfort along with fantastic style. Gotten so many compliments on the look of them. I switched from Nike to Brooks about 4 years ago and I'm never turning back. I get chronic shin splints and this shoe has helped that immensely when I run. I would recommend this shoe to anyone and everyone! #ReviewSweeps,
120249,5,10/22/2017,"Amazing shoe! The comfort of this shoe is amazing. I switched from Nike to Brooks 4 years ago and not one shoe has made me regret my decision.

120249,5,10/20/2017,Favorite shoes ,
120249,5,10/19/2017,"Super Cute and Comfy I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and very stylish. I wear them almost every day, mostly for my morning walks and throughout the afternoon as I do my errands. My one hang-up is that they feel just a bit bigger than my other Brooks PureFlows, same size (I've worn those out completely).  Not sure if I should exchange them, but then I don't want to get stuck with shoes that are too small. Either way, they are the most comfortable shoes I tried on at the sporting goods store recently and I will definitely be buying Brooks again!",
120249,5,10/19/2017,Love these shoes!! #ReviewSweeps I use these shoes everytime I run on the treadmill (5 times a week) and they are the best!!! Awesome support and suuuuper comfortable. I also get lots of compliments on the style!,
120249,5,10/18/2017,"I like these! These are very comfortable, and I feel like I land soft when I run. This is the first running shoe I've purchased that isn't a stability shoe, and I like the lighter feel. I'm still getting used to them and might look for another stability shoe for longer distances, but I've been running a 5k distance without my nagging knee pain. These are cute too, and look great with jeans. The fabric seems sturdy and I believe will hold up and wash well. I purchased the gray / dusty pink color. Love my Brooks, thank you for another great shoe!",
120249,5,10/15/2017,Very comfortable! I wear these shoes as my everyday shoe. Recently I was diagnosed with planter fasciitis and I wanted something with good support. These shoes definitely deliver on comfort and support!,
120249,5,10/14/2017,Loving my shoes I bought this pair for daily wear! I love Brooks shoes. My feet don't hurt and I don't immediately kick my shoes off when I walk in my house.#reviewsweeps,
120249,5,10/13/2017,I love the look and feel! ,
120249,2,10/13/2017,Too Narrow - Not as nice as the Launch Style Wore these for 15 minutes and had to take them off....they shut down the circulation in both of my feet.,
120249,3,10/13/2017,"Sadly unsatisfied These shoes are huge! Very, very wide and too big. I don't usually have issues with my Brooks. This is my 7th or 8th pair. Not sure if they were mislabeled?  but I threw away my box ... stuck for now.",

120249,4,10/11/2017,"Great and supportive shoe! At first these shoes gave blisters on my heals. However, these were my first brooks- I used to run in Newtons. After a week or so adjusting to them, they are very supportive and full of cushion. My ankles, hips, and knees don't hurt!",
120249,2,10/10/2017,The shoe is so comfortable. However it does not have enough But she was fine for walking or shopping. It does not have enough support to be an athletic shoe,

120249,5,10/09/2017,"Love these shoes! My knees and feet feel much better, no longer achy or sore. I work in a hospital as a transporter and put on about 10 miles a day.",
120249,5,10/09/2017,Support and Comfort I am a runner and I've ran in many sneakers but Brooks is my number one! It never fails. I have Plantar Fasciitis and this sneakers help with the hard impact. I love them!,
120249,3,10/09/2017,"Brooks - Revel I have several pair of the Brooks Launch3 shoes, which fit great.  The Revel has a narrower heel base than the Launch3.  When I step. I feel pain in my hip. The length is good.  As a result of pain, I need to return them,.",
120249,4,10/09/2017,Great arch support! This shoe gives me the right amount of cushion and support that I need! They feel great while cross training as well,
120249,5,10/08/2017,Great Fit right out of the box I wear only Brooks and have 2 different pair of shoes that I wear to my cross fit workout sessions.  My warm up is a fast mile walk around the buildings before workout sessions.These shoes are ready to go right out of the box.,
120249,5,10/07/2017,I will buy these shoes again ,
120249,5,09/29/2017,Grt sneaker very comfortable bought a 2nd pair right away ,
120249,5,09/25/2017,"LOVE them!! I recently purchased these before an international trip, planning to wear them on runs then use them for sightseeing – a couple of days, I wore my flats (non-cushioned, non-athletic slip-on shoes) instead...boy did I notice a difference!! The Revel is not only super-stylish, they are a cushiony dream for walking around big cities, even traversing cobblestone streets! I absolutely LOVE this shoe (goes with everything, too – never got tired of looking at them!). They are wonderful for running and sooo much more – level of cushioning beckoned me to stay in them all day! Thanks for this creation, Brooks!!",
120249,2,09/25/2017,"I love this shoe, but it is poorly made I love this shoe, but they ripped within the first weeks of wearing them. The material around the ankle is so thin and rips so easily.  I ordered one pair and they ripped and I thought this one pair might have been defective, but once I received a replacement pair the same thing happened 2 weeks later. I am heartbroken because I love everything about this shoe, but I want a shoe that will hold up. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone because it seems to be cheaply made.",
120249,4,09/24/2017,Comfortable Sneaker ,
120249,5,09/22/2017,"I will never buy a different brand again! After many years of working out daily and running, I have not found a pair of shoes more comfortable than the 'Brooks Revel'. I wear them every single day. The size and width are perfect. I have always been one to wear what's 'in style' (Nike, Under Armor, Etc.), but I will never buy another pair of shoes that are not Brooks ever again. I highly recommend these!!! 10/10",
120249,5,09/18/2017,Super comfy! Most comfortable shoe I've owned. Always have worn Asics and these are my first pair of Brooks. I love them. Have done some good hikes with them even and they are very comfortable. True to size. Had some compliments on the look too--went with white and black color and go with everything.,
120249,5,09/17/2017,"Would definitely purchase again I actually do not use these shoes as my running shoe, I run in the Brooks Ghost. I bought these shoes to be my everyday casual wear shoes after realizing that the Nikes that were serving that purpose for me were worn out and had no support. I like these because I can easily wear them with jeans and a cute casual top and they are very stylish and comfortable. I would recommend purchasing them.",
120249,5,09/12/2017,"My new favorite shoe! I have been a Brooks fan since my first pair in 2001. About 2014 I switched to the Ravenna (from the Adrenaline) and was hooked.  I tried the Launch 2 when they came out and they didn't work for me at all. The Ghost worked ok - and I went to buy another pair of those (I like variety) and stumbled across the Revel. I read the reviews and they seemed like a good bet. It was a good bet to have made. They are so pillowy comfortable, but not like walking in moon boots. The toe box IS big, but my toes seem to like it - no rubbing, no blisters. I usually wear a 9 1/2 in a running shoe, but listened to the other reviews and ordered a 9 and they are PERFECT. PLEASE don't take this shoe away and PLEASE don't change it.",
120249,5,09/09/2017,"Great shoe! I have been wearing brooks for 7 years.  I have previously only worn adrenaline and addiction. I ventured out this time and ordered the Revel, to wear to work as nurse.  I love these shoes they are light weight and comfortable. I love that they look a bit less bulky than the other running shoes that I own.  I ordered the same size in this shoe as I wear in the other styles and it fit great. The toe box was very roomy and I can't wait to get them in another color soon!",
120249,5,09/08/2017,"Make feet happy I'm on my feet 8hrs a day! Either walking fast or sprinting. I was in tears wearing my Nike free...It felt like I had bone spurs. The moment I put Brooks Reveal on my feet, they felt so so so much better. It's like my feet smiled! #thankful",
120249,3,09/06/2017,"Not so thrilled I am a nurse and stand on my feet for 13+ hours a day, so I need a shoe with optimal cushioning. Other than the shoe having excellent arch support, I did not like them. They didn't have nearly as much cushioning and support as my Asics, so they are going back.",
120249,5,09/04/2017,Amazing!! ,
120249,5,09/04/2017,I would buy these shoes again This is my second pair of these shoes. Love them. Very comfortable.  Good support.,
120249,5,09/03/2017,Absolutely! These Brooks Revels are great! Perfect shoe for the runner who runs about 10 miles a week! Super comfortable!: ),
120249,5,09/01/2017,Everyday shoes I like to use these shoes for everyday activities. I usually do a lot of walking at work and I needed another pair of shoes other than my running shoes. These shoes are comfortable and I considered buying them due to the cost and the review of other people. I have not ran in them but they are good for everyday use.,
120249,5,08/29/2017,Brooks Revel I have terrible feet issues.  First pair of shoes that have brought me relief.  Love them and ordering another pair.,
120249,5,08/29/2017,"Great new fit! Loving these shoes! I am a repeat Ravenna purchaser but the reviews about the narrow toe box on the 8s scared me off. The 8.5 Ravenna 7 was already a little tight for me, so when I got these in an 8.5 and they fit perfectly I was very pleased. Much more room in the toe box, and very cushioned. Great shoe for workouts or running around town! Please make more colors!",
120249,5,08/28/2017,I would buy the Revels again! Very light weight and comfortable. If I could change anything about the new Revels it would be a little more cushion. I would definitely buy these shoes again to add to my collection. I only wear Brooks!,
120249,5,08/26/2017,Absolutely love I've been an avid ghost and glycerin buyer but the last versions have just been so uncomfortable. Bought Revels and BAM!!! that's the brooks running shoe feeling I remember🙌🏼,
120249,5,08/23/2017,Love this show! This shoe was comfortable from the minute I put it on. They come with gel inserts which is a plus. I received dozens of compliments.  I typically wear glycerins and felt they perform the same and gave me the same support. Love them!,
120249,2,08/22/2017,"Wire support broke in the heel I really loved these shoes for walking and running- they're very supportive and comfortable. The only problem was after I'd had them for about 2 weeks, a wire in the left heel somehow bent out of shape and now it stabs/rubs the back of my heel. It has cut the back of my foot and is too uncomfortable to wear. I don't know how this happened because I'm very careful with my shoes, but I do walk/run a lot every day- I'm a college student and I usually get in over 10 miles a day. I love how brooks fit and I've never had a problem with any other shoe, so I will continue to purchase them- just not this particular shoe!",
120249,3,08/19/2017,"Didn't hate, but didn't love. I typically run in the Launch but decided to try these because I like to have options. A local run store tells me I should wear a 5.5 and to find a shoe in that size is difficult. Revel came in a 5.5 but I found it fit smaller than expected and after the second run they had rubbed blisters on my heels terribly. I had not experienced this with my past Brooks shoes. They do feel as though they have a bit more cushion than the Launch. I really have no other complaints and debated on returning for a 6 but decided to just go back to the Launch. I think it's just a personal preference.",
120249,5,08/17/2017,I love theses shoes. ,
120249,5,08/17/2017,Only wear Brooks. ,
120249,5,08/15/2017,A Winning Shoe! ,
120249,5,08/15/2017,I would buy this product again I have been using the Glycerin for the past three years and decided to try the revel after I read some of the reviews. I have to say they have become my new favorite.,
120249,5,08/14/2017,"I love these shoes! I'm normally a size 6.5 and I had to upsize to a size 7, but that's ok because of the extra cushion in this shoe you need that little extra room!!! These shoes are so comfortable especially on my healing broken ankle!!!! I love them!!! My physical therapist said Brooks are the best shoe you can get for ortho patients and he was right!!!!!",
120249,5,08/12/2017,"I get complimented frequently! I always run in Brooks,  but i purchased these because i liked the looks of them.  They are my 'wear around shoes'.  I get complimented all the time on them.  This is the first  time i have purchased Brroks for the  look of the shoe.  Way to go, Brooks, for being 'trendy'",
120249,5,08/08/2017,I love this product! I want them in every color! ,
120249,4,08/04/2017,"Great shoe! Overall very happy with the shoe, the only draw back is I feel like they are slightly too big. I have never had this issue with a Brooks shoe prior to this purchase. It is definitely not going to hinder my decision for buying another pair of Brooks shoes.",
120249,5,08/03/2017,I would buy these again! I went through 3 pairs of shoes before getting these. I loved the proconnect but since they discontinued them I needed to find something as comfortable. These are it. I will definitely be purchasing another pair.,
120249,5,08/02/2017,"Love love love! I need comfortable shoes. I have problems with both feet and ankles, Achilles tendonapathy, bone spurs, and nerve damage. This is my fourth pair of Brooks including Adrenaline, Ghost and Transend. The Revel is the most cushioned of all of them. My feet are comfortable and free from most of my pain wearing these shoes. I bought the white and black and I think they're very stylish.  I'm glad I gave them a try.",
120249,3,08/01/2017,"Very cushioning but not for me I was hoping this shoe would be the next step from the Launch. Loved the look of it. When I slipped it on, I noticed it had a lot more cushion so was excited to try it. Ultimately, the toe box was too wide and the shoe fit a lot bigger than the launch. Arch seemed to be at the wrong spot for my foot. Returned it but could see how this would be a great shoe if it fit appropriately.",
120249,4,07/24/2017,"All around great sneaker! I was given these shoes by Brooks and while I was hesitant on trying a Brooks style that I typically do not by, I was pleasantly surprised! They are hands-down the most light weight shoe I have ever tried! The style was comfortable and easily wearable! While I probably would not run miles in them, I think they are a perfect everyday walking/hiking shoe! Great job Brooks on creating a sneaker perfect for all types of athletics!",
120249,5,07/12/2017,"LOVE THESE SHOES!! I absolutely am in love with these shoes. I usually opt for the Launch running shoes because I typically do HIIT or 2-4 mile runs and I enjoy a lighter shoe. However, these Revel shoes have completely taken the cake. As soon as I put them on I was in love. I didn't have to think about this purchase at all. It was a done deal. Also, love the fact that these come in a neutral color. I got the gray/white/black pair. I like that they will match any outfit I may decide to wear during my workout. Kudos to Brooks for these gems!",
120249,5,07/10/2017,Absolutely the best Brooks running shoe ever!!! I've been wearing Brooks running shoes exclusively since I purchased my first pair several years ago. When Brooks offered me an opportunity to try the new Revel for free I was pumped. As soon as they arrived I put them on and went for a run. After 3 miles I couldn't believe how light and comfortable they were. I've worn them everyday for work and exercise since I first put them on my feet. I was so impressed I have purchased at least 10 additional pairs for my employees and family members.,
120249,5,07/09/2017,"Great shoe I was very fortunate to have been given the Revel to road test from Brooks.  The shoes are lightweight with plenty of cushioning.  I particularly like the soft mesh in the toe area with plenty of room in the toe box.  Colors are great also!  They felt comfortable from Day 1 and did not require a ""break-in"" period.  I am very satisfied with this new model.  Thank you Brooks!",
120249,5,07/08/2017,"Impressive, durable shoe I am a long-time Glycerin and Ghost fan, Brooks provided me with a complimentary pair of the new Revels to try out and review. I was a bit skeptical that they would work for me. I have a ""high volume"" foot, and wear the Glycerins/Ghosts in a wide width. Plus, I am EXTREMELY hard on the soles of my running shoes--they wear very quickly after just a few runs.So I was pleasantly surprised when, after logging about 50 miles in the Revels, I saw virtually no wear on the sole. The shoe is supportive but light, and worked very well for my tempo and 5 mile runs (though I'll probably stick with my beloved Glycerins for longer runs).While the knit upper accommodated my wide foot very comfortably, the shoe does run short. I usually wear a 9 wide in the Ghosts/Glycerins, and had to go up to a 9.5 in the Revels.Overall, I find the Brooks Revel to be durable and supportive without being too stable for my neutral stride. As an added bonus, they look really cool. I look forward to many more miles in the Revel. I definitely recommend this shoe!",
120249,4,07/07/2017,"great, lightweight shoe I received this shoe from Brooks to test wear and then write a review. I had never worn this model before. I am usually an 8.5 Women's and that fit perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised by this shoe and would buy it. It's lightweight, pushes you forward in your stride, good cushioning. The only negative is I notice the shoes slaps a little. I usually strike the ground neutrally and without much sound and this shoe slaps. However, it does allow for a natural gate and seems to give more momentum as you foot pushes off. I could see wearing this as a marathon shoe and lighter weight trainer. I have only had it for about 1 week, so I'm curious how it will wear over time. It's a great addition to my collection and I can see myself buying another pair!",
120249,5,07/07/2017,"Cushiony shoe I received the pink/orange Revel from Brooks to test out before their official release.  My normal Brooks shoe is the Glycerins in which I always wear an 8.5.  I found the Revels to be super comfortable, cushiony, and an all day shoe.  The toe box is a nice size and does not squeeze the toes at all.  I wore them to play tennis, on a few shorter runs, and for every day walking around.  I was sent a size 8.5 since that is what I wear in the Glycerins and I found them to be about a 1/2 size too larger.  Still totally wearable, but a little too loose for a longer run.  I would definitely recommend these.",
120249,5,07/07/2017,Good product! I bought a pair of these shoes. While I don't run I buy the running shoes for the support that I need due to foot surgery. I love the way they feel and the support they give me. I will probably always buy this brand now. The only thing I would like would be shoes that aren't so colorful. I bought some glow in the dark orange shoes and had to buy clothes to match them. The color actually worked out quite well because I taught an exercise class to the elderly and they were always complaining because they could not see my feet. After I bought those shoes they had no problems seeing my feet!,
120249,4,07/06/2017,"Comfortable, Lightweight and Loads of Cushion Brooks provided me with this shoe to test and provide feedback. They sent me the pink and magenta purpley color. I've been wearing Brooks for over 7 years. I am a fitness professional and participate and train in lifting, CrossFit, running (5ks to ultras) and high intensity intervals which includes moving laterally and changing directions quickly. But I love a shoe that I can easily toss on with jeans and hit the street in style and comfort. This shoe provides both. It's very comfortable, offers a nice roomy toe box, lots of cushion and would be a great shoe to travel in a tight suitcase without being afraid of crushing the heel or ruining the structural integrity of the shoe. Upon opening the box, I immediately fell in love with the bright color and airy design. The toe box is made of a knit fabric which resembles a mesh-like breathable material. Fabulous neutral shoe for neutral arch and/or light supination. It's not a shoe I would recommend for high miles (< 4) but is perfect for short runs, interval training, lifting and cross training. May not be appropriate for super narrow feet and not ideal for over pronation.",
120249,4,07/06/2017,I will buy these again. Love the new white and black combo I'm still getting used to the Revel. They are a little big in front from bottom up to the toes. I'm used to having toes more snug. This might be a good thing.Arch might be a little off.Love the way they look.,
120249,5,07/05/2017,"Great new shoe I received the Revel from Brooks last week. Very comfortable, more than any other shoe I've had. Cushioning felt great on runs. Roomy toe box. Very similar to the Launch which I've used for years. I'd rate the Revel above the Launch. The fit is the similar to the Launch.",
120249,5,07/04/2017,"Great light shoe with cushion I only run in Brooks sneakers, from trails to road to the track, and loved the revel because it is light but has cushioning. I was asked to try the shoe and I ran in it on several surfaces. It fits true to size but has a slighter larger toe box than their launch shoe and is lighter than the glycerin. The cushioning was great and had neutral arch support. The laces tie and hold well and the mesh is light and breathable. I would wear thicker socks with it in colder weather. Love the bright color choice and very comfortable.",
120249,5,07/03/2017,FEELS LIKE YOU ARE WALKING ON CLOUDS!! I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and these shoes helped me remember what comfort should be like.  I have a 1 mile track around my house that is paved with small rock.   The Revel shoes handled the rock with comfort and support.  The lining around the heel and ankle is very supportive and cushy at the same time.  Very hard to find a comfortable shoe for  anyone with Rheumatoid Arthritis but Brooks nailed it this time!!!  Thank you Brooks for the continued desire to make the perfect shoe!!!  Never stop running happy!,
120249,5,07/02/2017,"Reveling In My Revels I love this shoe. I am admittedly a Brooks addict. I've run in quite a few Brooks models of shoes (Ghosts are my go-to's for distance, launch/pureflows for shorter distances/training runs) - and was super excited to get my hands on this shoe. It was love at first sight (and first run) - right out of the box. I love the knit upper (stylish and super comfortable), the light weight, the cushioning - you name it. They look great on the run and for all those post run activities (whether taking a strength training class, or running to brunch - these shoes do not make you look like you're sporting clunky running shoes. The latest launch, the flow completely changing - had me at a bit of a loss for my lightweight trainer (that would cover both a run and some gym time). The Revel saved the day for me (and it feels great).I have been part of the Brooks extended family for years and one of the things I love about Brooks is their commitment to the running community -- and that they truly listen to our feedback, good or bad. I did receive the Revels from Brooks to review (the good, the bad, the ugly...) - and love that they want to know what regular runners like us think (remember our campaign to bring the launch back when it was discontinued? It worked!). I was prepared to be critical (we are critical as runners, it's in our blood :)) - and I couldn't find a thing I *didn't* like about the shoe. If you're looking for a lightweight trainer that is both looks great and functions great -- this is your shoe.",
120249,4,07/02/2017,"I highly recommend these shoes Full disclosure, the Revel running shoes were free to me from Brooks to try out & submit an authentic review. Immediately I loved the feel of these shoes! They provide cushion, neutral support, and plenty of room around the toes. I usually wear the Brooks Glycerin but like that I have an alternative shoe for running. I no longer run long distances so this a nice shoe for a 2-3 mile run. The Revel shoe doesn't have enough medial support if If I were to increase my distance.",
120253,1,12/21/2017,"I won't buy again! Brooks had one of the best shoes for my feet problems. I wear orthodics and brooks has always been the most comfortable shoe, especially the Addiction 10. The 11 and 12 worked fine also  but this model is terrible. The toe box is too short, laces too short and just not comfortable. I will never understand why they have to keep changing the design. If it isn't broke don't fix it! I have struggled to find shoes for years that would accommodate my lift and orthodics  and of all the other brands I tried, Brooks worked the best. NOT ANY MORE! Back to the drawing board as they say, to find something else that will work. It will be a difficult search and I am extremely disappointed with this company!",
120253,5,12/21/2017,"Great shoe for 12 hour shifts. I'm a RN and these are my work shoes. I have all kinds of foot issues, including plantar fasciitis. These offer stability and comfort. I put my custom orthotics inside them as well. I did size up one.",
120253,5,12/11/2017,love the Addictions! Just wish they came in more colors. ,
120253,3,12/06/2017,"not until you change it back to what worked Brooks addiction has been my go to shoe for many years.  However, the quality has really gone down hill in the past two years.  The addiction 13 is a very nice looking shoe but because of the changes you made in the heel it seems to not have the support and the lift is all wrong. It pushes my foot down into the toe of the shoe and puts strain on my back.",
120253,2,12/04/2017,"Try before you buy. I was a dedicated wearer of the Addiction 12s, but the 13s have shrunken a half-size, and the height of the shoe in back is smaller. Additionally, these came with laces that are too short for an extra loop at the top to keep the ankle stabalized within the shoe. I may buy Brooks again, but definitely not the Addiction model.",
120253,4,11/28/2017,Great shoes These shoes are very comfortable with new padding. I have only worn them once due to shoelaces were too short and I had to order new laces from another company.,
120253,5,11/24/2017,I would buy again and again ,
120253,3,11/21/2017,"Comfy but less support I buy the Addiction running style due to a need for very supportive shoes for daily wear, exercise and playing pickleball. I wear them with a medically prescribed orthotic. The 13 is a bit shorter than the 12, but has better cushioning. (I suspect there's a cause-effect there.) Unfortunately it doesn't come up as high on the ankle which really diminishes the support. In both cases I suspect cost-cutting by using less material for what they think is the same shoe. It's not the same. I'll have to wear these only for daily wear, not exercise walking or pickleball, so I'll be searching for a better support shoe. It's a shame because I think Brooks has been the best show manufacturer. The best design for me was the Addiction 10 and it had been downhill from there. Also, the laces are shorter and made with lesser quality material so they don't stay tied as well.",
120253,5,11/21/2017,"color You finally got another color besides that dark grey and I went to buy another pair and now you don't sell them anymore. It took you 2 years, I give up on Brooks, it's a shame.",
120253,2,11/14/2017,"They run too small I think Brooks has changed their sizes. I have worn Brooks 8 wife for years and years, and now they seem to small and narrow in the toe box. Very disappointed.",
120253,5,11/04/2017,I am so happy with these shoes! I will buy them again! ,
120253,5,11/03/2017,"Love These Shoes, Would Buy Again and Again I wear these as my everyday shoes with prescription orthotics. I love them and have been wearing this brand for several years. If I wear any other type of shoe, my feet hurt, but as long as I wear these every day, my feet feel great. They do wear out after about 6 months of use, not by looks (they still look great on the outside) but by supportive components inside the shoe, and I can tell when they wear out because my feet start to hurt even when I am wearing them every day. So, after about 6 months, I buy a new pair and my feet feel great again. This particular pair that I recently bought is a bit loose, and I always buy the same size, so I'm not sure why they seem bigger than usual. They're still very comfortable, but the shoes slip on my heels a bit when I walk, but not enough to want to return them for a smaller size. The shoelaces are a little bit too short. I like to keep my laces loosely tied because too-tight laces bother my feet. A minor annoyance is that the shoes squeak with every step. I'm pretty sure this is due to my prescription orthotics, though, and not due to a flaw in the shoe itself. Usually, baby powder underneath the orthotic takes care of the squeaking, but for some reason, with this particular pair of shoes, the squeaking persists. Overall, this is an excellent shoe and I'll continue to purchase them.",
120253,1,11/01/2017,"Slightly Different Shape than Addiction 12 I have been running in the Addictions for years, and am bummed about this update. Two things that are nice about the version 13: it is more cushioned than past versions, and is more fashion-foward/looks less orthopedic. Unfortunately, the shape of the bottom of the shoe has changed very slightly from past versions. As someone with chronic stress fractures, the super-straight last of the previous models was the only thing that prevented my shin pain. The slightly more curved shape of this update is really aggravating my injuries, as my arch now pronates over the side of the shoe (and I have a narrow foot). Hoping Brooks goes back to the straighter last in the version 14, as I can't wear this version.",
120253,3,11/01/2017,"Not a fan Too high at the heel, feels like the foot is being pushed into the toe area.",
120253,5,10/26/2017,I would buy this product over and over again. This product was recommended to me by my foot doctor.  I had some troubles and he thought this product would help me out.  This is my 3rd pair and I won't buy another brand or type of sneaker again.  My husband and I walk many miles/week and these sneakers are very durable and comfortable.,
120253,3,10/18/2017,Another kind ,
120253,2,10/13/2017,I would not buy this product again. The extra cushioning in the heel and arch is uncomfortable. I work in food services and am walking quickly through the kitchen. These shoes do not provide the 'spring in my step' like the Addiction 12 does. I am very disappointed that you have changed the formula of your shoe! Now I don't know what to wear to work.,
120253,5,10/09/2017,"Most stable runner yet! This is the most stable version of the Addiction thst I've worn.  Solid support, great fit.  Stable enough to wear for light mountain backpacking.",
120253,4,10/09/2017,"Good stability shoe On a ""stability shoe"" scale of 1-10, the Addiction is an 11.  They're like bricks on your feet, but you will not pronate at all.  Also, I tend to get blisters but that hasn't happened in the Addiction.  I've been training for a marathon in the 12 and bought a pair of 13s because the 12s are almost worn out.  The 13s feel about a half size smaller in the ankle and mid foot due to extra padding, but they're about the same in the toe box.  I have narrow feet so this is perfect for me, but people with wider feet might want to be aware.  #ReviewSweeps",
120253,4,10/08/2017,Mixed- love the shoe- don't care for the new fabric I love brooks shoes. However it seems they have changed some of the fabric that is in the inside and pulled it to the outside. Mine broke within 6 days of purchase and had to return for a new pair. Not sure if the second set will do that or not. If they were going to do that- they need to put a stinger fabric there. That's my only complaint. If I was going to refer a friend this specific shoe I would include that detail until brooks gets the problem fixed,
120253,1,09/30/2017,"Cheaply made short toe This shoe seems cheaply made and is not comfortable at all. I have bought probably 10 pairs of the addiction 12's. I was excited about the colors in this shoe. I thought it looked more like a ""normal"" running shoe. I could hardly walk after a day of wearing these. So disappointing when there are not many options for us overpronators. Now I can't even find my size in the 12 model :(",
120253,3,09/29/2017,"I have wuestions,about this product. I have worn the addiction for years. I have plantar faciatus and flat feet that are pronated. My feet are narrow. I have worn my orthotics with your insoles in the past. This pair I have to wear one or the other. Also the heel is wide and my heel pops up. I am now wearing heavier socks and laced in extra hole on top and that helps some but they don't seem to fit as well other years. Wete there changes made . I noticed more foam at top of heel and heel seems higher.",
120253,1,09/28/2017,Ugly I have been wearing this brand and this model of show for 10 years. These shoes are a god send. I absolutely love these shoes. However this years color scheme is so ugly that I will be looking for a new brand of shoes. They are ugly.,

I'm female, weigh around 155 lbs and run up to 5x a week about 2-4 miles each day.  I thought I would try these seeing that it ""returns energy to you"", however, it didn't do much for me. My thought was it could help lift my feet and push me forward so my legs would get less tired and I could run farther.  Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations.  I've decided to go back to my Glycerins and just ordered the 15s.",
120258,5,12/05/2017,yes I would buy again. I am using this shoe to train for my 4 day event=48.6 miles. And it is surprisingly comfortable. I was hesitant. It has been great from 5k to so far 15 miles. I will know when I add more miles. I will buy again. I have a wide toe box(only) and this fits great. I stayed true size. So far so good!,
120258,4,12/03/2017,Nice shoe. Im wearing it for work at Hospital This is a great shoe for walking and standing on hard Hospital floors. I had to buy a half size bigger than normal. My normal size fit too tight.,
120258,5,12/03/2017,I bought 2 pairs The levitate is comfortable on my feet and feel very light to run on!!I just love them!!,
120258,5,12/02/2017,Love the bounce ,
120258,5,11/30/2017,"Never been more excited to get running I've never put on a pair of shoes, right out of the box that just seemed to fit me so well.  I've been looking for a longer distance shoe to mayyyybe work myself up to a full marathon.  These don't feel heavy.  They feel like a more cushioned version of a ""connect"" shoe with the typical springy-ness that you find in the energize family, which these are.  Basically they feel like the best of both worlds.  I was surprised at looking at the weight compared to my pureflow 6's but they do not feel heavily weighted.  Might update after I get some runs in but very excited out of the box! I love the style too!  I couldn't wear my other brooks to work b/c they look too specific to the purpose of running but these I can get away with looking more casual, outside of running (I got the white ones). Size is on point.  I'm typically a 7 in Brooks and the 7's work great.",
120258,5,11/28/2017,"I have PR'ed every race since I bought these... coincidence? I feel like these shoes have taken my running to the next level. I have shaved off at least 30 secs per race. I didn't want to say its the shoes but I'm pretty consistent and the race I ran right after I bought these was a PR for me... and then the next race after that! So, I will give the shoes the credit this time. I can't wait for these to come out in more colors. I absolutely love them.",
120258,3,11/26/2017,"Caution on frosted streets! I bought these early fall, and they are great on the dry street and the indoor track.  I took them out for the first time on frost, and they didn't have any grip.  I'll be trying something else for my late fall and winter runs :(",
120258,5,11/25/2017,"Great replacement for the Ravenna After Brooks changed the Ravenna TOO MANY TIMES, I was forced to find a new shoe 3 weeks prior to the Marine Corp Marathon. Needless to day, I was a wreck with the idea of changing shoes so close to a marathon after training in my Ravennas (I had 3 pair of the Ravenna 6 on my shelf and my last pair was worn out). I ordered the Levitate as soon as they were released on the recommendation of the Brooks rep and I was NOT disappointed. I finished the marathon with my feet feeling great ... no blisters, no soreness and good cushion for all 26 miles. Now, PLEASE do not change these shoes!",
120258,5,11/25/2017,Very nice ride! I run/walk/elliptical in these shoes and I love them. Great quality! I can tell there was much thought put into the design.,
120258,5,11/20/2017,"Love these shoes These are my new favorite shoes!  I love these shoes. Wish they had more colors though.  My only complaint is when the Roads are wet they seem to have less traction, and feel a little heavy!  Will definitely purchase again but would love more color options!",
120258,2,11/19/2017,"Like walking on stilts I really wanted to love this shoe. I usually run in a nuetral, light weight minimalist type shoe. I wanted a good marathon shoe, and after trying tons on, I settled on these. After running in them once, I will be returning them. They sit so high, I feel like I am wearing platforms to work out in. They are definitely padded and bouncy, which is great. However, they feel heavy to me, and my feet were rediculously sweaty after less than a mile into my run. I felt as though they were pushing me forward onto my shins. I would not recommend for someone who is used to a light weight, minimalist type shoe. I like to feel the ground a bit when I run. It is a wonderful quality shoe, though! It really comes down to runner preference. I really disliked the very vintage looking upper, and silver sole, too. The color choices and style were not at all to my taste.",
120258,5,11/18/2017,"Love It!! I love the cushioning on the shoe. It feels wonderful when running and I love the feeling of bouncing along when I walk.  In addition to being a wonderful shoe for runners, it is attractive.  I hate to admit it, but sometime I have bought a shoe because it is pretty only to find that it hurts me when I run.  I have found that Brooks shoes are best for my foot and no longer buy other brands.  I have bought Ghost, Pure Flow, and Adrenaline but find Levitate to be the best for me.  Love the shoe!!",
120258,5,11/16/2017,"Best running shoe I used to wear adrenaline, but found them to be too wide in the toes, I need a shoe with good comfort and stability,  I have morton's neuroma in one of my ""hammer toes"" (lol its funny just writing that) and I have a high arch.  Not to mention hip pain and experience shin splints alot.  Not with these babies!  I love running in them.  Wish they had them in more colors.  I've been wearing brooks for 20 years and love this switch!!",
120258,5,11/16/2017,"My new go-to shoe! These shoes are very responsive, comfortable, light, easy to wear. Not soooo much cushion that I can't keep my form strong, but comfortable enough to sustain long runs. My favorite Brooks shoe yet!",
120258,5,11/15/2017,"Yes a thousand times! I love everything about this shoe when it comes to comfort, purpose and style. Thank you for making awesome shoes. I am a nurse and am on my feet hours a day. My only shucks about this shoe is when it is wet outside they feel very slick when I walk on a hard surface. I wish they were not so slick. I will still buy again. I love this shoe.",
120258,5,11/15/2017,Very nice shoe This shoe is comparable to the Transcend.  Very comfortable and resilient.  Wish there were more choices of colors.I would/will buy another pair.,
120258,5,11/12/2017,"Great shoe, but too much cushion for my taste The shoe fits very well (width, sizing, etc). However, I prefer less of a cushion when I run so that I can feel more feedback from the ground. Too much cushion for my liking, but still a great shoe nonetheless.",
120258,5,11/10/2017,Great product! Have only used these shoes a few times since purchased.  The second time I used them was for a half marathon.  They were comfortable and did seem to help with the run.  No blisters on my feet when I finished.,
120258,5,11/06/2017,"Absolutely love these! Been running for 20 years, tried all different shoes.  These are my favorite by far!",
120258,5,11/05/2017,Would buy product again I have problems with sciatica and these shoes help a lot. Very minimal pain if any. Very best pair of brooks I have ever had.,
120258,5,11/05/2017,LEVITATE!! Love these shoes!! Need more color choices! These shoes live up to the hype! My speed has absolutely increased and my joint soreness has decreased! Awesome!,
120258,5,11/04/2017,"New fav shoe for long distance running I was planning to wear my ghost 10's for the nyc marathon, but decided to give these a try at the last minute (don't worry, I had a few long runs left in my training plan)...and they're AMAZING. I used to have the Glycerins but found them a little too heavy so I switched to Ghosts...the Levetate seems to be the best of both worlds; the springiness of this shoe makes up for its weight and yet I feel like I'm running on pillows. Plus they look really good! One small pet peeve is that women's and men's shoes come in different colors...what's with that Brooks? Would have loved this shoe in grey, since white (although it looks amazing) would be SO hard to keep clean. Even the blues are different between M/W.",

120258,4,11/03/2017,"Super shoe but small(er) toe box I really really wanted to love these shoes as I am in desperate need of a new road shoe but the toe box on these is just a tad too small. I am keeping them and running my December marathon in them with the hopes that maybe they will loosen up a bit. They are incredibly comfortable though and I love the 8mm drop which is hard to find in a road shoe (either they are 12 or they are 4 or less). Only complaint is the toe box needs to be a smidge wider but overall, super cushiony shoe! #ReviewSweeps",
120258,5,11/03/2017,Brook's never disappoints Brook's running shoes will always be my running shoe choice. Loved the Pureflow 4 - wish they would come back - Pureflow 5 changed the tongue and it cut into the top of my foot. Just wore out my two alternate pairs of Pureflows and decided to try the new Levitates. LOVE them!! Running the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon this weekend and can't wait to wear them for the long haul : ),
120258,4,11/03/2017,"comfortable shoe Wear them daily, alternating with other Brooks shoes. Good shoe once you used to the ""bouncy"" feel/ +/- 2 days. Good toe room. Mesh could be a little stronger.",
120258,5,11/03/2017,Brooks is now my favorite running shoe! Great cushioning and comfort with this shoe and not heavy. Essentially no need to break them in.,
120258,5,11/02/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I own These shoes run slightly wider than other Brooks shoes I've had, but using a lace-lock technique gives them a perfect fit. The soles are soft and have give, but are not squishy. I was surprised how supportive the knitted upper is.  These shoes are my new favorite Brooks.",
120258,5,11/02/2017,"Amazing! This is my new running shoe! Perhaps Brooks should have called then ""Elevate""!! My knees and hips feel so much better running in my Levitate's!!",
120258,5,11/02/2017,Brooks has created a Runner's dream shoe! Sizing...I size up a full size and it's perfect. 67 years old and ran my best time in my new Birthday gift ...Levitates!  Ran a few miles today in them and again my fastest time with energy to spare. They are saving my knees and legs!!  Thank you Brooks!!,
120258,5,11/01/2017,FABULOUS SHOE ,
120258,5,11/01/2017,"This is a lightweight, flexible, comfortable sneaker. I love this sneaker!  Fits well and was true to size. Enough room in the toe box.  Flexible and comfortable!  Plan on running my first half marathon in these!!",
120258,5,10/31/2017,Great shoes fabulous look Mainly I wear ghost 10 now but added these because they are new and so beautiful. I want to try running in them more once I get over mild case of plantar fasciitis. These don't make it any worse. They feel light and comfortable. I wear narrow in the ghost but these fit in the regular width so maybe they run a little narrow but it works for me. Have gotten dozens of compliments on their appearance (white/silver).,
120258,5,10/31/2017,Levitate I love the springy feel! Makes me excited to put them on and go out for a run!,
120258,5,10/30/2017,Brooks Levitate I love the Brooks Levitate. The shoe is extremely comfortable and felt great on my long run. I plan to wear them on my next marathon!!,
120258,5,10/30/2017,"Comfort that carries Jumped into a 5k as soon as I got these. No foot problems was a welcome surprise closing out 2-years on the proverbial couch. Was worried about the impact of running as a heavier person, these carried me perfectly well. Thanks, Brooks! Laces should be a bit longer.",
120258,5,10/29/2017,Amazing comfort Amazing out of the box comfort. I rotate my shoes so I don't have a ton of miles on them yet but so far I am happy with the comfort and durability. #reviewsweeps,
120258,5,10/28/2017,definitely incredible!!! have ben wearing Brooks for eight years!! This is the best one yet!,
120258,4,10/28/2017,"Love the shoes but gosh we need better colors. If you like running in clouds this is the shoe for you! I went from few years in Kinvara to 3 yrs. in Boost but now I am back to Brooks baby:-) I am in love with shoes and I had hoped the relationship with last few years but I had the opportunity to see images of Levitate 2 and noticed the the knit upper (not a fan) of knit wrapped around my ankle, sorry.But for the love of god, with all the colors in the world available especially for women why not have red, orange, yellow, green, why choose blue for both men and women So, I beg you to give us more bright colors of this version, I need to hoard few pairs desperately.",
120258,5,10/28/2017,Just had to try Right from beginning these felt like running on a cloud. Started out few miles to break in but didn't feel after first couple runs I needed to worry. I ran my marathon in these and my feet didn't bother me at all. No blisters or rubbing. I liked that they where light but still had a cushion ride to them. #ReviewSweeps,
120258,5,10/26/2017,"Freaky Fast Having been an elite runner for years, I know a great shoe when I put it on.  These are incredibly comfortable and very responsive.  I'm crazy bummed that I'm injured right now so I can't take these out for a run because I know these would change the game.",
120258,5,10/26/2017,"Worth Every Penny I was very hesitant to purchase shoes online without trying them on first.  However, I was out of time and my next race was looming and my previous shoes were toast.  I told my friend unless these shoes were PERFECT I'd be sending them back and if I had to send them back I probably would not be ready for the race.  These shoes were perfect.  Really happy with them. Good shoes are mandatory to being able to run mileage, especially as you get older.  These shoes really have good shock-absorption.  My back doesn't hurt, my ankles and knees feel great.  Good shoes can't fix bad running form, but all things being equal, good shoes are definitely worth it and I am very pleased with them.",
120258,5,10/25/2017,"LOVE THIS RUNNING SHOE I needed a new pair of shoes. Hadn't always been a Brooks girl. I'm an older runner and the newer, flatter designed shoes didn't offer the support and cushion my joints needed. I hesitated ordering a shoe online, I was out of time, needed to ramp up my training for my next half and I told my friend, if these shoes don't fit PERFECTLY I'm sending them back and not going to try to do this next half marathon. I was shocked at how well this shoe formed to my foot and how incredibly comfortable it was. It was worth the price. I'm not one who easily parts with my money. I'm happy, very happy, to say my training is on track for my next race and I look forward to putting these shoes on.",
120258,5,10/24/2017,Awesome shoes I have been using brooks for 3 years now. I love them. I have wore mostly all the books running shoe and this one by far is the best all the way around. I run marathons and can't wait to do one in these shoes.. it's a must buy,
120258,5,10/24/2017,Tons of bounce Very comfy and tons of bounce. Super comfortable and sleek look! Great new shoe!,
120258,5,10/24/2017,"Love!!! Let me begin by saying that I am NOT a runner because I want to be, although I do enjoy it when I have time. I'm old and out of shape, and I'm only doing the whole walk/run thing because it's a requirement for a college class. I'm definitely no expert! I mostly walk with a little running sprinkled in here and there during each outing. I usually go out for a walk/run on the bumpy county roads around my home at least 3 times a week. I can tell a difference in the cushioning with Levitate, especially when I run. My feet and knees don't feel as tired when I finish my walk/run. I went a little over 9 miles yesterday, and I still felt fine afterwards. Levitate is the 4th or 5th pair of Brooks running shoes I've bought for myself, and I have loved each pair! The only thing I wish Brooks would do is use more reflective materials on their running shoes for us people who only have time to go out for a walk or run when it's dark.",
120258,2,10/24/2017,Not for distance ,
120258,5,10/24/2017,Amazing shoes! Absolutely love these shoes! They are extremely comfortable and I feel good running in them!,
120258,5,10/23/2017,"Love these shoes!!! So comfortable..like running on a pillow I wish there was a bigger color selection, but hey, I run in the dark, so no one sees them. They are very comfortable. I have owned over 25 pairs of Brooks, and I definitely feel these are the most comfortable.",
120258,5,10/22/2017,"Dream shoe! If you like feeling like you could run all day, getting the best value for your money and sporting a quality shoe, I highly recommend this new creation! It has quickly become my new favorite (was a Launch devotee for years). It performs really well on technical trails, too!",
120258,5,10/22/2017,Waiting for new colors! ,
120258,5,10/22/2017,Super comfortable ,
120258,5,10/22/2017,"Favorite Running Shoe A few Brooks shoes need a half size bigger, and this is one of them. The strike is perfect, rolling the foot from ball and heal quicker than any other Brooks.",
120258,5,10/22/2017,I LOVE them!! After my half I used these on my track runs and absolutely love them! They are so comfortable and I feel like I can run forever in them!,
120258,5,10/22/2017,"The best yet from Brooks! Had to go half size up but no biggie. If you have a narrow foot these should be perfect. I've never had a shoe that didn't cause foot pain, this is a game changer!",
120258,5,10/22/2017,"Speedy & cushy I bought this shoe to try something new, I typically run in adrenalines. I run a lot of miles each week and I typically need lots of cushion and stability. This shoe is a neutral but is still very soft to run in, and much lighter than my other training shoes. I have worn it for both speedwork and long runs. I love this shoe a lot! Very glad I bought it and I hope they come out with even more colors in the future, but I love the blue color! This shoe looks and feels great :)",
120258,5,10/22/2017,I will definitely be buying these again I use these strictly for walking for exercise. They feel great! No pain sometimes associated with walking lots of comfort and padding for my high arches!,
120258,5,10/22/2017,"Spectacular! My ""go-to"" shoe prior to the Brooks Levitate was the Brooks Glycerine. I decided to give this a try to change it up. I am not a power runner, nor do I run several days a week. But I am on my feet 12-14 hours per day on my job. I wear the Levitate to work in and to run in. I mostly run 5K's. They are super comfortable right out of the box. They give excellent arch support, and I have no heel slippage. I love the cushion they give and the responsiveness they give on heel strike and toe take-off.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Best shoe ever! I have purchased many different styles of brooks shoes, these by far are my favorite! The support and cushion are excellent. I run 40-50miles a week, these are my go to shoe!",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Light and comfortable I have a lot of foot problems and have to have a lot of cushion in my shoes.  These are very good, and being so lightweight is an added bonus.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Excellent, more cushion than launch 3 First, know that in Brooks, you have to order .5 size up compared to other running shoes--so ehen I sat it is TTS, it is within that context. Thesehave a lot more cushion than launch,but feels like the same shoe.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Wow! Amazing! These are perfect! Have always loved Brooks, but now I have my perfect match in shoes! They are comfortable, but have a firm ride on the pavement. Great rebound on hills - which I love since I run lots of them!",
120258,5,10/21/2017,Run better I love these shoes.  Currently training for my first marathon and have switched from Ghost to Levitates.  Could not be happier with performance or recovery.,
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Love these shoes Very responsive shoe. I usually get something that helps with arch support, but these are right up there and I love them so far!",
120258,5,10/21/2017,Love them I usually wear the Ghost which I also love- but I'll use the Ghost as a comparison.   The size and width to me are the same. While the Ghost is cushioned the Levitate feels cushioned ALL around. Like my feet were wrapped in comfort. So soft.  Technically the Ghost are lighter but I felt the Levitate was so much lighter.  Floating on air.  I was looking for a shoe that felt lighter to me and these are them.,
120258,2,10/21/2017,"Traction on damp ground is terrible! I like the fit and feel of the shoe, but the traction on damp ground is terrible! I felt like I was slipping every step on multiple sidewalk and road surfaces. I wanted to like the shoe, but it's just not practical for a rainy city like Seattle.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Happy wife, runs happy, equals hapy husband Gift for wife, uses as training shoe and for matching her blue Brooks running apparel.",

This was true on multiple types of sidewalk and pavement. I want to like these shoes but they aren't practical in a rainy city like Seattle.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,Levitate Shoe I LOVE this shoe.  It usually takes a bit of time to get comfortable in a new shoe.  This was comfortable the first moment I put it on.  It provides great support but has amazing cushioning.  Truly the best shoe I have ever run in!,
120258,5,10/21/2017,Love the levitates #reviewsweeps. These shoes are wonderful. I can't tell that these are a heavy running shoe because I honestly can't feel the outer mesh of the shoe . They are very comfortable. When I run they are light and springy . I was able to do both speed work and long runs in them with no problem. I enjoy the fact that the midsole drop is 8 mm . I've notice that the 12 mm drop of the ghost 10 make my knees hurt . Looking forward to other new colors in the future 😀.,
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Great shoe Love this shoe so far. Great support, great comfort, overall just energizing",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"amazing I recently transitioned to the Levitate from the launch. There's a bigger toe box, plenty of cushion, and my feet do not hurt after long runs. These are incredible shoes, light, and are comfy out of the box.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"So far soooooo GOOD! Took these on the road and gravel trail.  Did great for both.  Handles well with a forefoot strike or a heel strike. Excited to keep working up the distance with these, using my trusty Launch kicks in between.",
120258,5,10/21/2017,"Love them! From the very 1st run. Love the feel and the suppprt. Have only had for a few weeks but, have already put 20 miles on them getting ready for a full marathon this next weekend.",
120258,5,10/18/2017,"Just right! Straight out of the box they felt great.  The upper knit has just enough stretch to give my feet a custom fit. The soles feel both cushioned and springy at the same time.  I took them for a run on the same 4 mile loop I did yesterday wearing different shoes. Same time of day, same temperature outside. My heart rate average was nearly the same, so it would appear I put forth the same effort today, but my pace per mile dropped by almost a minute in my new Levitates!  I can't wait to test these out on longer runs. I have tried so many different shoes from so many different brands, trying to find my Goldilocks pair, and I think the Levitates are just right!",
120258,5,10/18/2017,I am in love with these shoes Running on roads and gravel is much more comfortable with these shoes. My knee pain has lessened tremendously as well. I'm now a Brooks fan for life.,
120258,5,10/17/2017,"LOVE this shoe! In the interest of full disclosure, I was provided a free pair of Levitates by Brooks to review.  I've run in Brooks Ghost for the last 5 years and have also run some in Brooks Launch.  Straight out of the box, I loved the Levitate.  They're very much a neutral shoe and feel much like the Ghost except I think they feel a little lighter and have a little more ""spring"" to the step.  The padding is very similar to the Ghost and slightly more padded than the Brooks Launch (which I view as a good thing.  I like Launches but after about 6 miles the ball of my foot starts to hurt, so I do all my long runs in Ghosts.) The day I received my Levitates, I put them on and wore them around all day with no issues.  Super comfortable, no need to break in.   Bonus: They looked great with jeans!  I love the color (I was given the white/gray).  Running: I've done two runs (3 miles and 5 miles) in my Levitates and I love them as much as I love the Ghost.  Sizing: I typically wear a Women's 8.5 in a Ghost, 9 in a Launch because they seem to run a little smaller.  Brooks sent me an 8.5 in the Levitate and they fit great! I always wear Medium (B) width and the width on these seems very similar to both the Ghost and Launch.  Overall, a great shoe and even as much as I love the Ghost, I would certainly consider purchasing these for my next pair of running shoes!",
120258,5,10/16/2017,Already in love! I've worn Brooks shoes for years and started to feel like the Glycerin shoe wasn't maintaining its cushion. Decided to try Levitate and have yet to be disappointed!!,
120258,2,10/16/2017,"This shoe is heavy This shoe is stable and comfortable. When I read the specs, before I ordered,  I was worried about how heavy it was. I even emailed Brooks customer service to ask about other people's experience with the shoe, but no one got back to me.  However, I love Brooks, so I decided to give it a try anyways.   It seems to me that their advertising is conveying the message that Levitate is a springy, fast shoe that is stable enough for marathon training. This shoe does not deliver. It is clunky and heavy. A great shoe for a beginner, or for people who like a lot of shoe. Very cushioned. No bounce, no energy return. Sorry, this shoe is not it.",
120258,5,10/15/2017,"New go-to I was really looking forward to these shoes coming out and they do not disappoint. I have been running in the glycerin for a year, for reference. I normally have some plantar tenderness the day after running and I did not have that at all with these. I felt less fatigued while running in these. I wore these to a race and ran 50 seconds/mile faster than my normal pace and went for two miles further than I had trained for. I'm floored. They're also gorgeous and come in a neutral color which is a first in my Brooks collection. So excited to keep running in these!",
120258,5,10/15/2017,"I just wish there are more color to choose from for women I wish there are more colors to choose from for women, for some reason colors for men are nicer than for women",
120258,5,10/14/2017,"Free return energy on a run? I'll take it! The Levitate delivers a comfortable ride with a great design. I tried these on a 16-mile run and felt great. I dare say my legs and feet did not feel quite as tired as usual - whether it was psychological or the actual shoes who knows, but whatever works! I love the silver color along the bottom sides, too - a nice touch. I found these to be heavier than my Launch, but about on par with my Ravenna 7's and Asics Nimbus series. I'm used to running in heavier shoes, and was not bothered with the weight of the Levitate. I would recommend these for moderate to longer runs and save the lighter shoes for speed work. Kudos, Brooks! #ReviewSweeps",
120258,5,10/11/2017,Outstanding!! ,
120258,5,10/09/2017,"The Brooks shoe I've been waiting for! Never before in my life have I pre ordered a pair of running shoes, but when Brooks announced this shoe, I had to.  I am so glad I did!  I am a 44-year-old mom of three.  I run at 5AM to get my workouts in before I help my kids get their day going and get my day going.  I run 30-35 miles a week, and my favorite distance is the half marathon.  I'm a decent runner.  I might place in my age group, but not any kind of superstar.  I also lead a running club for moms.  :) I like a neutral shoe that feels super responsive but gives me enough cushion that makes me not feel like I'm banging the ground.  The PureFlow 6 has been a great shoe for me (not the 5, I did not like the 5 at all, but love the 6), but it's got a bit of the banging going on.  I've put in hundreds of miles in the PureFlow, but always wished I felt a bit faster and felt like I had a bit more cushion in them.  For that reason I've looked to other brands to find a lightweight trainer, and tried several that were okay, but haven't found ""the one.""  The Levitate is ""the one"" for me!  I don't wear a wide street shoe but I do find that my forefoot feels cramped after a few miles if there isn't enough space in the toe box. The fact that Brooks run wide has been a good thing for me.  This one felt too tight on my first run, but I loosened the laces a bit for the second run, and it was almost perfect today.  So, it would likely work for those who need a traditional fit as well.The cushion is absolutely perfect.  It feels like a slipper when you put it on, and when you run it's there, but light enough that you can feel the ground.  I like a responsive shoe that feels fast over a thicker sole, and this fits the bill.  These shoes arrived Friday.  Put six miles in on Saturday and thirteen this morning.  On Saturday I wasn't totally sold because of a bit of pinching, but after loosening the laces today, I am all in!  Levitate is my new soul mate running shoe!  Thanks Brooks!",
120258,5,10/08/2017,"Amazing! I bought these because I am on my feet all day at work and often have to sprint at work. Between 8 hours at work and an hour at the gym, I am so thankful I found these shoes! So comfortable!",
120258,3,10/07/2017,"Nothing special about them First, Brooks' pre-ordering system is absolutely awful.  After absolutely no notification about my order and the website showing the order as ""closed"" yet, I did not have the shoes; I ordered from another vendor.  The next day, I get an email from Brooks saying my order has shipped.  Well, that pair is going back.  Now for the fit review.  Sorry to be the naysayer, but I find these shoes just ""ok"" and can find nothing special about them at all.  Normally wear Brooks Glycerin and another name brand that I actually like better than these.   I think Brooks might have hyped them up too much.",
120258,5,10/06/2017,"Don't let the weight fool you I have to say I am impressed by the Levitate.  I normally run in the Brooks Launch and have not been able to find a shoe to alternate with until now.  Most highly cushioned shoes feel squishy and bother my knees, these shoes feel pillow soft and responsive while causing no knee issues at all.  Brooks provided me with the shoes for my review so on my first run I really wanted to pay attention to every detail.  About 2 miles in I said to myself ""oh wait I am supposed to be thinking about my shoes"".  They are so comfortable I forgot about them.  That is what I want in a shoe.  They are heavier than the Launch but feel surprisingly lighter than their weight would suggest.  I feel the weight difference but I found I still had a really nice turnover going.  I am curious to see how many miles I can go before the weight becomes an issue, or if it ever will.  The upper fits my foot great with no pressure points or hot spots.  The Levitate is a really nice shoe that I plan on running many more miles in.  I also feel it would be a great everyday shoe for someone who is on their feet all day.",
120258,5,10/05/2017,"Most Impressive This is has been the most impressive straight-out-the-box Brooks shoe I've ever tried. I've run in the Launch, GTS, Glycerin, and used to have the Ghost as my main shoe. Then I switched to the Adidas Ultra Boost b/c nothing else had the perfect combo of energy return, sock-like feel of the knit upper and heel, flexibility, and being a lightweight but supportive enough shoe for the long mileage (10+ mile runs). But now another shoe does have this perfect combo: the Levitate. I ran 4 miles in the Levitate. I would def take it for a couple of 4-5 mile runs to break it in then think it would be ready for anything. Was excited too for Brooks to offer colors other than pink and purple. I hope the Levitate becomes a permanent style in the Brooks lineup. It has all the features you need for a versatile neutral cushioned shoe - it can be fast and quick or support pounding the pavement for miles. Love it!!!",
120258,5,10/04/2017,"LOVE I have always worn Brooks and decided to switch styles and try the Levitate. Good thing I did. This shoe is absolutely amazing - super comfortable, responsive, and light weight. If I could, I would buy a pair of these shoes for everyone I know. Truly, the best shoe that Brooks has ever made. They are stepping up their game!",
120258,5,10/02/2017,"Love at 1st Lace! It's true, I put on these shoes as soon as they arrived and wore them around the house and they were so comfortable right out of the box.  In fact, I kept them on that evening as I knew I'd be on my feet for a few miles walking around an amusement park.  I normally wear the Brooks Launch with a Super Feet insole in them however I've wore these for a few workouts and haven't felt the need to add my insoles.  They feel sturdier yet softer than the Launch but not squishy like the Glycerin (which is too much cushion for my feet).  I feel like if the Ghost, Ravenna and Launch had a child, these are it!  Just a enough support and cushion to keep my feet from tiring.  The knit upper is very comfortable and feels like it would accommodate any expansion I'll have in a longer run and seem like they will hold up over the miles..  Overall I'm very impressed with this new model and look forward to many more runs in this pair!I was provided this pair of Levitates in exchange for my honest opinion on the shoes.",
120258,5,09/30/2017,OMG!! You have to try these I love these shoes. I am not a runner bit I walk alot and I am on my feet most of the day. These shoes are amazing. I was a loyal gel nimbus fan until they came out with version 19. I started looking for another brand and was shocked how truly comfy they are. This is my first day wearing and I dont want to take em off.,
120258,5,09/30/2017,"Review of new Levitate The Levitate running shoe feels heavier than the Launch or Revel out of the box. However, when running, the shoe feels light and responsive. You feel the energy from the shoe helping you to push off and increase pace during easy runs as well as workouts. The shoes are comfortable, more so than other shoes. I could easily transition from the Revel to the Levitate. The sizing is similar to the Revel and/or Launch. The mesh material on the toe box provides additional comfort since it conforms to your toes, no tight or restricting areas. The material is also breathable, adding to the comfort especially on warmer days.I was sent a pair of Levitate, free of charge, before the release date to wear and honestly evaluate.",
120258,5,09/30/2017,"Running on air I am a 41 year old female. I have been running for 20 years. I run an average of 20-25 miles per week. I am also a spin (group cycle instructor) and SilverSneakers instructor. I am 5'4 and weigh 128lbs.  I run mostly on road and treadmill.  I have a high arch. I am very injury prone. I have suffered 5 stress fractures and numerous tendon issues over the past 3 years. Because of my injuries and high arches, I require a shoe that is neutral and cushioned. I also like to feel the road as a personal preference.  I need a shoe that is light weight and responsive.  The new Brooks Levitate goes beyond my criteria.   On my first run with these shoes, I almost forgot I was wearing a shoe. It is so light weight and comfortable. It fits perfectly.  It has a unique feature that allows for an easier response and push off from the midfoot.  The toes of the shoe are elevated allowing for an increased push off, making strides almost effortless. Not only does this design feature provide an easy stride, it is a fast shoe and most importantly for me, the metatarsal area feels 'protected'.  The padding is placed perfectly to support my high arches. The color (silver) makes the shoe seem even faster.The shoe is designed to be a running shoe. I would use caution wearing it for any other purpose. The design of the toe area, while improves the running experience, it awkward for walking or other activities. I would highly recommend the Levitate shoe for runners.  They are by far the most comfortable and efficient shoes  I did not purchase these shoes. ",
120258,4,09/29/2017,"Great new shoe from Brooks I have been running in the brooks Ravennas for many years.  Probably back to the Ravenna 2 or 3 and love that shoe.  I've always leaned toward a stability shoe and have found the Ravenna's stable, comfortable, and with great support and responsiveness.I was excited but nervous to try something different from my trusted running shoe.  I took the Levitate out for an 8 mile run on a hot day.  My first reaction was how responsive the shoe was but without the loss of stability I would have expected.  The shoe encouraged a more mid-sole landing, but also had a nice quick toe that had my turnover feel very natural and fast.  The toe box is much more narrow then the Ravenna but not in a constrained way.  It felt cozy, not tight. And I experienced no rubbing in any part of the shoe.  Additionally, they were vented nicely so my feet never got hot.  And the way cool looking mirrored outer soul made me smile.  I'm sure they are highly reflective at night but I didn't try that out. I took them on a treadmill run 2 days later and they did not disappoint.  I usually slug through my treadmill runs but not with the Levitates.  I finished my run feeling great and the whole time I keep thinking how easy the run felt, although still running at my normal pace.Overall I would recommend the Levitate for any neutral or stability runners looking for a change. And a special thanks you to Brooks for sending me this pair of levitates at no charge for me to try for testing purposes",
120258,4,09/29/2017,"Comfortable Long Run Shoe I received a complementary pair of the Levitate in exchange for my honest opinion. In 5 days, I logged 40 miles on road, non-technical trail, and treadmill.  As a runner not interested in pink shoes, I was happy to see light grey. The fit is extremely comfortable. For those who loved the original Launch (the most comfortable shoe I have ever slipped on) the Levitate has the same feel. I wear a normal width, but my feet are on the wider-side and these fit well. The upper has a lot of give. I had enough room in the toe box. I recently damaged my toenails running a steep downhill marathon. The toe box did not cause my sensitive toes any discomfort. I did not experience any hot spots or blisters. I had no heel slippage. The ankle collar is secure and comfortable. This shoe did not rub my Achilles tendon in anyway that could cause irritation. There is plenty of cushioning underfoot. I ran steep hill repeats on dirt and they absorbed shock well during the descents. Traction was no issue on the ascents. In addition, the tongue is plush and the laces do not put any pressure on the top of my foot.  The running I did was slow-paced. When pace matters, I use a very light shoe. Most of my training is done in racing weight shoes. The Levitate are significantly heavier than anything I currently own. On my second run, a 10M run, I felt the weight of the shoes. However, they are flexible, responsive and therefore comfortable despite the weight. By the third run, I was used to them. On my 4th run, another 10M run, I forgot that I was even wearing test shoes until I took them off.   I would not race in them or use them for speed work, as they are too heavy for me for those types of workouts. I feel the Levitate are high-quality, comfortable, and stable. They seem best suited for easy-paced road running over short and long distances. I do plan to keep them in my shoe rotation for those reasons.Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review the Levitate.",
120258,5,09/22/2017,Two test runs so far...LOVE them I love the fit and feel of these shoes.  I have worn the Launch for many distance runs and this fits my foot a bit better and feels light and springy.  So far have really enjoyed this shoe!  The color combo of the blue is AWESOME!  Looking forward to breaking it in a little more!,
120265,5,12/27/2017,Omg!!!! I love them!!! ,
120265,5,12/18/2017,"So far amazing I use this shoe for walking, running, gym. I love everything about it. I've been a loyal Cascadia fan but the Cascadia became too narrow.  This shoe 👟 has a nice wide toe box and is much more energizing than the Cascadia.  Wide feet rejoice!",
120266,3,12/24/2017,Unfortunately had to return Loved the Launch 2 and was hoping to love the 5.  Unfortunately the toe box was too low & narrow for me & the arch was too high so I had to return the 5.  Thankfully Brooks has a wonderful return policy.  I hope to find a different Brooks product to work rather than having to go back to a Saucony.,
120266,5,12/23/2017,"Great shoe! Much better than Launch 4 I've ran in Launch for the last several years. My favorite was the 3, but my last pair were retired and I couldn't find them. So I got the 4 and ended up having to return them. Then saw that there was the 5 and I *love* them! They feel extra comfortable but without sacrificing the feel of the run that I love about the Launch. Absolutely recommend this shoe!",
120266,5,12/08/2017,"Love these! Launch has been my go-to since the pure connect was discontinued. The launch hold up way better than my connects. I don't have to replace them as often. I love these! They are a great price and an amazing daily trainer. I use them to run 3-30 miles at a time...my feet love them!! The bright colors are fun, the brighter shoe, the faster the runner!!",
120268,5,12/27/2017,"Excellent in Support & Comfort My Husband said ""Try Brooks,,,they are THE most comfortable I have ever worn.""And they are!  I was trying them on,,walking around the store,,,,forgot I had them on, the ""feel"" is amazing.    I am broke a bone in my foot 10 months ago, and needed an extra good shoe,,,,These Brooks exceeded ALL my expectations,,,and I have No foot pain wearing them,        Thank you BROOKS!",
120268,5,12/26/2017,I have worn Brooks shoes for running since the '80s I have run 11 marathons only using Brooks since the eary '80s. Now I am in my 70s and walk more often than run but all other brand of athletic shoes fall short. All of my running friends and family use Brooks shoes. Everyone is happy with them.,
120268,2,12/23/2017,Not comfortable They're not as comfortable as the 17. The Adrenaline are usually comfortable out of the box but not the18 they hurts my bottom of feet just below my heel.,
120268,5,12/21/2017,"I have been training and racing in ASICS for over 20, BUT no ",
120268,4,12/21/2017,"Going back to the Ghost I bought these shoes after I was advised by my local running store that I needed a more supportive shoe than the neutral Ghost 9s that I'd been wearing.  On my very first run at around 4 miles, I felt shin splints flare up that I had not felt in my Ghosts or any other shoes for many years.  My thought is that perhaps the recommendation from the shoe store was improper.  I purchased the new Ghost 10s and my shins are still a little tender but nothing like the run-ending pain I felt in the Adrenalines.  All that being said, for the right person, these are awesome shoes, very light and comfortable to run in other than my unique injury.",
120268,5,12/21/2017,So comfortable Have had trouble finding a shoe that was comfortable and looked good.  These are so comfortable and supportive at the same time.  Will probably buy several more pairs.,
120268,3,12/20/2017,Not a fan of the new design Still a comfortable shoe but I question if they will hold up to the wear that I put a shoe through. Very narrow. I absolutely love the last two designs in the Adrenaline series. This design not so much.,
120268,3,12/20/2017,"Not a fan of the new design Still a comfortable shoe, just not as comfortable as the the Adrenaline 17. Feels very narrow compared to the last few series in the Adrenaline line.",
120268,3,12/20/2017,"I still trying I love the color, I was waiting for black shoes with the support, I have adrenaline 16, and they are great, but the 18 are not, by my toes I feel like a hole, I really don't know if is the pair they sent me or all are like that, otherwise they are fine.",
120268,5,12/20/2017,Love them! Was looking for a lightweight pair of running/walking shoes that are comfortable and I found them!,
120268,5,12/19/2017,Amazing product! Love the GTS 18 Adrenaline shoe!! I've been wearing Brooks shoes for 8-9 years! Won't wear any other brand!!,
120268,5,12/19/2017,Great Shoe The Adrenaline 18's feel great! I wanted a supportive and comfortable shoe because I am able to get back walking again in half marathons. I am healing from plantar fasciitis and knee issues. I find these shoes so comfortable they are my go to shoe for everyday.,
120268,5,12/18/2017,"My feet are so happy!!!!!!! I've been a fan of the Adrenalines since version 14. Version 17, by far, was the most uncomfortable. Something construction kept bumping into my arches in the most awkward way like never before. I bought so many other brands and even tried the Ravenna. None really fit well and/or aggravated by plantar fasciitis. Then this new version comes along. No hot spots. A little roomier in the heel than I'd like but I can live with that. Best of all, NO HEEL PAIN. None. I've only run a few miles but I can't tell you how much I love this latest version. It's the best version yet. Please don't change it!!!!",
120268,5,12/17/2017,Perfect fit! I never knew what I was missing until I got a Brooks shoe in the wide width. I just realized I've never had shoes that fit. I want to live in these shoes.,
120268,5,12/16/2017,"New favorite shoes I decided to switch to Brooks for running shoes, and I am so glad I did. These shoes are the most comfortable I've owned, and I love running in them.",
120268,5,12/16/2017,"Best version of this shoe ever! I have worn Brooks Adrenaline since the 11s.  I hated the 17s, they never softened up, felt very stiff, and felt like I was running with no padding at all and considered switching brands.  I decided to give the 18s a try and they are perfect!  They are much softer on the ball of the foot, but not so soft that you don't feel you have control.  They are light and not bulky.  They provide correct amount of support for my pronation.  I normally wear a 9, but I always go up half size in Brooks bc I don't like my toes hitting the end when I'm running downhill.  Best version of this shoe yet.  I'll be ordering another pair of these bc I like them so much.  The look great, not as bulky looking as previous versions of this shoe.",
120268,5,12/14/2017,Great shoes. Comfortable and supportive. Tend to wear down the outer heels before the shoes are ready to be retired but wear casually after.,
120268,4,12/13/2017,"Not as wide as I would have expected I have always loved this shoe and still do.  I typically get normal width and they work, despite my wide feet.  I ordered these shoes in a wide and they didn't seem any wider.  Otherwise great shoes. Give a lot of support.",
120268,5,12/13/2017,"This is the only shoe for me! I'm normally a 9.5 flat footed wide foot. It's VERY hard to find any shoe that's comfortable with support. I tried these shoes on in a store and the sales lady said I should purchase a 10.5 W.... so I did.  The shoes are amazing! So much arch support, breathable fabric, wide enough for my feet, etc.  It's made of a breathable fabric and I'm soon going to order the same shoe in black. I wish they made more colors in the wide!  Thanks Brooks for making shoes to fit real feet :)",
120268,5,12/13/2017,I would buy it again I use this product for work. I walk alot and have flat feet so it helps me not hurt in my lower back and peronious longus muscle,
120268,5,12/12/2017,"Usual comfy class! One of the best shoe companies for people, like me, with no arch and past fasciitus.  Rock that arch support!",
120268,5,12/10/2017,I practically been levitating in my new Adrenalines! ,
120268,5,12/10/2017,feels so good ,
120268,5,12/09/2017,Best running shoes ever!!! I will never buy any other running shoes but Brooks.  They are the best.  My new shoes feel already broken in.  I have 5 pair of Brooks and they keep getting better and better!!,
120268,5,12/09/2017,Best running shoes I've ever had! So comfortable. I am able to run for miles without any pain or discomfort. I will be buying these again when I wear through the ones I have currently.,
120268,5,12/07/2017,"Love, Love, Love the Adrenaline 18!! I've been wearing the Adrenaline for years but this model is by far my favorite.  So comfortable, fits great and looks good too.",
120268,3,12/07/2017,Sneakers are a hit but the colors are a miss! The colors are not very attractive on this shoe.  I have every pair of their commemorative sneakers and love them..Had they done these in colors other than Christmas red and green they would have been SO cute but was unable to stop thinking of the holidays.  Sorry Brooks - I love your shoes but these are a miss!,
120268,5,12/06/2017,"Good Shoe, Would Recommend I purchased these shoes because of the comfort and structure provided. This shoe is great for over pronators like me! The arch support is comfortable and fits nicely under the foot without irritating it. The cushion is incredibly soft, which is something I have to get used to. Overall a very good shoe. The new update looks stylish and matched the other Brooks running shoe styles.",
120268,5,12/05/2017,THESE ARE A SURE BUY I am training for a marathon and the comfort is amazing to get me to the next mile,
120268,4,12/05/2017,my go to shoe for narrow Very comfortable.  A slight change from previous models but I would still buy again.,
120268,1,12/05/2017,Had to return this product This shoe does not have the lip outside of the big toe that the 17 had.  This provides much better stability so I returned the 18 and ordered 2 pair of the 17 model.,
120268,5,12/04/2017,"The Adrenaline is back After the last couple of seasons I was consideting trying another shoe. I was very disappointed in the 15, 26 and 17. However I am totallly pleased with the 18th. Much improved.",
120268,5,12/04/2017,"Provides relief for plantar fasciitis Been suffering with plantar fasciitis pain sporadically for two years. So far, this shoe provides great relief even after walking for several hours on concrete and/or  asphalt. Provides support needed to stabilize inward gait, which contributed to fasciitis pain.",
120268,5,12/04/2017,My favorite Adrenaline so far! Really the most comfortable Adrenaline I've owned! Shoe is true to fit and me feet feel great after a run!,
120268,5,12/03/2017,This is godsend! I love the cushion and support! The GTS17 were good that I have 2 pairs. This is even better!,
120268,5,12/02/2017,Best Adrenaline ever I am a nurses assistant and have been wearing Adrenalines since 2010 for pronation support and comfort. This new upper mesh and full interior liner is warmer and less airy. I have arthritic lumps on the top of each big toe and the lacing eyelets don't rub on those spots as most shoes do. These are definitely the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and will be ordering in other colors. The GTS is great if your ankles tend to roll in. Thanks Brooks for continuing to improve on an already great product. I'm sorry about the review from the person who said they were not  up to par from the past. In my opinion these are the best year yet!,
120268,5,12/01/2017,"Great Update! This is a great update! I love the added cushion and they provide the right balance of cushion and stability. I also love the design upgrade. I've always loved the adrenalines, but hated how bulky they were. The new design is much more sleek!",
120268,3,11/30/2017,This shoe was wonderful but has become way too narrow! I've bought this shoe several times 1 size larger for a custom insert.  The past two shoes were much narrower than usual.  The pair I just ordered I had to return because it was just too tight every which way.,
120268,5,11/30/2017,I would buy this shoe again! ,
120268,5,11/30/2017,Brooks Adrenaline GTS doesnt disappoint This model is quite a bit different looking from the the previous Adrenaline GTS  running shoes from the past. It doesnt look as bulky and seems more lightweight but still has the same stability that I need and have come to depend on.  It will be interesting to see if the overall shoe holds up as well due to the new look.,
120268,1,11/29/2017,Sent it back The color was awful and you only offer one color in AA width.  Since there is no choices I had to go buy another brand.  I have worn Brooks for several years but not this year.  Please offer more choices for AA.  Thank you.,
120268,5,11/29/2017,"Very comfortable These are so comfy, right out of the box they felt great.  I like them much better than the Adrenaline 16's that I was wearing.",
120268,5,11/29/2017,Love these shoes! I started walking 3 months ago and at almost 50 was worried about the stress on my legs and feet. My Brooks make walking so much easier and my legs and feet feel great. walking 5 days a week and loving it!,
120268,3,11/27/2017,Not what they used to be. I have been wearing the Adrenalines for 12 years. This will be the last pair I buy. I love the new look but I hate how they feel. There's less support than in previous versions.  I find my knees a bit sore after a run which only used to happen when the shows were worn out. They were tight initially but stretched out with wear. I'm pretty bummed overall.,
120268,5,11/26/2017,Great shoes. Perfect color. Finally!  All black adrenaline shows in a wide width.  Now I can wear them to work. Thank you!,
120268,1,11/26/2017,"Hole within a week Very comfortable, but I had to return them because a hole formed on the toe box with a week of use and less than 2 miles of running.",
120268,4,11/26/2017,"Love the shoes but can't wear them I couldn't wear them.because the left shoe slid on my heel so bad it pulled my sock down. I am wondering if it was just that pair and maybe if I tried another one it would work. I really wanted to keep rhem, just couldn't deal with the heel.slipping.",
120268,5,11/26/2017,Great new running shoes These shoes are very supportive and great for my narrow feet.  They are light weight too.,
120268,5,11/26/2017,More comfortable than GTS 17 ,
120268,5,11/24/2017,My first pair of Brooks I love the Adrenaline GTS 18.  When I tried them on in the store I could tell they were much lighter than the Asisc I have worn for over 5 years. I really liked how they felt in my feet when I ran the first 5k in them.,
120268,5,11/24/2017,"Perfect Running Shoe for the NYC Marathon My husband bought this shoe for me as a gift to wear for the NYC Marathon, before wearing them on the day I had only wore them once. My feet were never so happy as they were that day. Not once did my feet hurt, no blisters or no rubs. Absolutely nothing, even my pedicure still looked fabulous afterwards. I can't even begin to express how important this is for me that my feet feel good during any run especially 26.2 miles & the GTS did exactly that !! Always had issues with other running shoes but since I switched that has not been a problem. All around this shoe felt amazing & the toe box is measured perfect !! Please do not ever stop making the GTS !!",
120268,5,11/24/2017,I would buy this product again Right out of the box comfort. This is my 3rd pair of Brooks GTS and I just love the fit and comfort as well as the look.,
120268,5,11/24/2017,"VERY LIGHT I am training for a marathon and these are very light and comfy ,i did a 1:30 hr. run and my feet felt great ,, zero issues .",
120268,5,11/22/2017,The best shoe ever! I ran the SouthBeach Ragnar.  I ran in downpour over two hours and within an hour the shoes where completely dry. They are super light and very conformable to run in.  Go buy you a pair or two. Very Happy Runner Mom:),
120268,1,11/19/2017,"Less support than the Adrenaline GTS 17 model... Tried on the new model, it has much less support and padding than previous models especially the '17 and '14 and overall less cushioning. The top mesh looks like cheap carpeting! I am very disappointed the workmanship is not consistent!",
120268,5,11/19/2017,"Love the shoes Brooks shoes are very comfortable, hold up well and I love their color selections.",
120268,3,11/18/2017,"Comfortable, but not to wear on wet surfaces Shoes are very comfortable, however if you happened to walk, dont even try to run with this shoes while it rains or on wet tracks, surfaces if you dont want to end on the floor. Is very slippery and is not slip resistance.",

120268,1,11/14/2017,"Slips off heel I'm a competitive runner and I've been wearing the adrenaline since 2009.  This model does not fit like the previous ones - it completely slips off my heel when I walk, I can't even run in these shoes.  They are not too big and I don't know why they are so slippery at the heel.  I have never had a problem like this with running shoes.",
120268,3,11/14/2017,"nice shoe but not for me like 17 I gave this nice looking shoe an extended try while in a local sporting store and was at first happy to feel the cushioned support around ankle.  I felt the brooks familiar comfort right away...but after in them a bit my little toes were hurting on outside edge, never had that in 17, and the front end of the shoe felt less supportive somehow or cushioned then previous model.  If it were not for toe rub Id be comfortable buying and giving a try if I couldnt get to a 17 but since they rubbed, no go I went out and got another pair of 17's so hopefully by the time I need new ones subtle changes will have fixed this.",
120268,5,11/13/2017,"It is a miracle! I'm in heaven! I've had issues with my achilles heel for years now. I would try running shoes, but they always hit in the wrong place, aggravated it and made it swell. I would have to wear backless shoes like clogs which are terrible long term and I couldn't use them to run or walk at any kind of pace at all. These shoes are cut low enough in the back that they don't hit, plus the heel support in the back is soft, not hard like most. I am getting ready to go to a fitness camp and was fearful of not finding a shoe I could use, now I'm fearful they'll discontinue it at some point, so I'm buying a couple more pairs just in case. Blessed relief...thank you!",
120268,5,11/12/2017,Love this shoe! I was recommended this by my podiatrist. And I had added in a suitable sole in replacement of the original sole. And it is a dream to run in these shoes ever since. I used to have shin splints with my previous shoes but now the splints are gone! Running was never easier!,
120268,5,11/12/2017,Podiatrist recommend - love them! Walk everyday and was having major foot issues.  Dr recommend this shoe and pain has is almost gone!  Love it!,
120268,5,11/09/2017,"I would buy this product again I love these new Adrenaline GTS 18 shoes!  After trying Asics Kayano 24, Kuru, Saucony, and two other Asics, these are the most comfortable.  After trying on the Adrenaline 18 in a women's 9 1/2, I decided to try the same shoe in the men's 8 1/2.  The men's is wider in the toe box and for some reason has more cushion in the sole.  If someone wants a wider toe box in the women's shoe it is available.  However, the cushioning is less.  They look like the Asics Kayano 24 but retail for $40 less! I would advise anyone to try them in a store first because the sizes vary quite a bit.  I have pretty flat feet and these are not a very rigid shoe (like the Kayano 24) and the arch is not very high.  Also, this is the first shoe that doesn't slip on the heel.  I wear a women's 8 1/2 in a street shoe, regular width.  But I like a wider shoe because my feet swell when I walk. All in all, if you want a comfortable shoe that doesn't pinch your toes, slip on the heel, grip your ankles like a vice and jab your arch then the Adrenaline 18 could be for you!",
120268,4,11/09/2017,I am buying agian! ,
120268,5,11/07/2017,Love the shoes I bought this product just used it once in awhile because of how pretty they are but decided to run on them and I run on them all the time now,
120268,5,11/07/2017,I would buy this range again! I was recommended this by my podiatrist. And I had added in a suitable sole in replacement of the original sole. And it is a dream to run in these shoes ever since. I used to have shin splints with my previous shoes but now the splints are gone! Running was never easier!,

120268,5,11/06/2017,Awesome running shoe!! Absolutely Love! The 18's feel lighter and more comfortable than the 17's which I love too!,
120268,5,11/06/2017,Awesome!! I love the new Adrenaline Gets 18!! Very comfortable...and the width of the shoe is much better!!,
120268,5,11/06/2017,"Cute and comfy! Great running comfort! Good cushioning and support. I walked all over New York City, ran the Abbott Dash to the Finish 5k, and cheered on marathoners in them. My feet never felt tired!!!!",
120268,5,11/06/2017,Great shoe best one yet Great cushion and support. Been wearing GTS fir years and I like this one the best.,
120268,5,11/06/2017,"Wonderful, wonderful improvements in the Adrenaline! Fantastic Shoe! I usually have issues with my right small toe with pain and impingement from overlays on the outside pressing onto this area. This shoe doesn't have that issue. The material is smooth and wonderful. Also, this shoe is lighter than the previous versions of the Adrenaline. Overall, a fantastic shoe with wonderful improvements. Keep making the Adrenaline better and better.",
120268,4,11/05/2017,"Horrible color options for wide width I have been a Brooks Adrenaline girl for almost 20 years. I love them so much. However, I have a wide foot and have to get the wide width, so I have NEVER gotten to enjoy the fun color options Brooks offers to the normal width. Every year I am disappointed by the color options they choose for the wide width. I have contacted Brooks before and suggested they change their options for wide width. But again this year, the options are terrible. Grey (blah), white (could you be more boring???). At least the blue ones are a little better. But why can't you offer them in the pink's or the turquoise or any other fun colors??? Why the white and the grey?! People with wide feet like fun colors too, Brooks!!! Please stop being so sizest!!!",
120268,5,11/04/2017,"FINALLY!!  My Adrenaline has come home! I am an RN, and a soccer mom, and I HIIT train at least 4 times per week.  So, I basically live in my running shoes.  My first pair of Brooks was the Adrenaline 14, and I LOVED them.  Then along came the 15 and 16, and Brooks lost me.  They were heavy, stiff and hot.  Luckily for me, I kept trying each new model in the hopes I would love them again, and the 17 has made it happen!  They are, once again, lightweight and soft yet still offer the support I need to function all day every day.  The only thing that could make them better would be a little more pizzaz, but I'll give up a little style for the comfort of this shoe!",
120268,1,11/01/2017,WHY did they change the style????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sooooooooooo upset that they changed the style of this shoe. Definitely NOT buying them this year.... Serious SAD FACE going on....,
120268,5,10/28/2017,I love these shoes I bought these shoes today after trying on about 20 other pairs of stability shoes and these were perfect. I have a hard time with fit and most shoes seem to pinch my toes but these fit just right. I am super happy I bought them.,
120268,5,10/28/2017,"Such an improvement I was lucky enough to purchase a pair of the 18s on a pre sale basis from my localrunning store. This shoe was noticeably more comfortable than the 17s or 16s on the first day. Every time I wear these for runs, I'm just so pleased of the combination of a light weight shoe with great support and cushion. The 17s always hurt the bottoms of my feet when I ran, almost like they were too stiff or something. So pleased this version are winners. These and the 14s are my 2 favorite versions so far. Thanks Brooks",
120268,5,10/25/2017,"AWESOME UPDATES!!! I have worn many brands and styles of running shoes. I always return to the Adrenaline because it feels like home, BUT this current version? It feels like heaven! It seems lighter than other versions and has a little more spring. Also, I have an issue typically with the toe box being a little tight and I have to loosen the laces as much as I can to not have any rubbing on my right little toe. NOT THIS VERSION!! It is awesome! No rubbing, no anything except a great experience. You need this shoe! This shoe is a HOME RUN!",
526628,2,12/05/2017,"Would be perfect if they lasted.. Favourite trainers, super comfy, but this is the second pair to get a hole in the front after less then three weeks training :( Wont be buying again.",176755352
526628,5,11/14/2017,So light... They feel so light you barely feel them when you move. Can't fault the looks either.,175999398
526628,4,10/21/2017,Defective??? I got a pair of these bad boys earlier this year and up until recently it was one of the best running shoes I've ever owned. Unfortunately the bottom black sole started detaching and I can feel it fold as I run/walk sometimes. I know its bound to happen due to wear and tear but I've only had them for less than a year and expected them to last longer. It's unfortunate because I love Nike and the Flyknit. I was looking into getting a pair of the new Mariah's but now I'm a little weary due to the circumstances. In the end If it weren't for this incident id give the Flyknit Racer 5 stars. I'd like to think maybe my pair were just defective. Don't let me stop you from owning your own pair.,173858734
526628,5,10/19/2017,"By far best shoes!!!!! I run in-between 60-70 miles a week with tempos, long stead state, threshold, fartleks and distance speed work runs mixed in. And these shoes have been the best all around shoes Ive ever worn hands down. 

Breathabilty and traction on all surfaces have been incredible. Very light but with just enough amount of cushioning so you wont beat your legs/feet up. Be sure to run atleast 50% - 60% of your runs on soft surfaces like grass, dirt trails, rubberized track etc.. in these shoes though or you will probably feel discomfort from the minimal amount of cushion. 

I've found that I can run up to a half marathon fully comfortable in these and they are super fast enough to even do 1200 to mile speed-work intervals on the track. 

Durability is pretty good but I did find that the in-sole cushion gets worn out and beat up badly. Its normal though and happens with every shoe. Wish nike sold the in-sole cushion separately so I can replace my worn out ones. I've given these shoes a beating with around 300 miles on them and I think I can give them another 70-100 before structural integrity starts giving out. Just need new in-sole cushions though.

Overall these are the best shoes and I'ld buy 15 pairs enough for the whole year if I had the money. This is the perfect runners running shoe for racing and training. 

In the future for serious athletes I wish nike could evolve purchasing methods to include something like a monthly bill for a pair a month or yearly discounted rate for 12-15 pairs of the same shoes to be shipped to you all at once so when a pair wears out you can just keep going instead of having to shop and wait for the new pair to come in. This would be perfect for me at the beginning of the year if can just stock up on these and then throw down 2000+ miles for the year on the same running shoes. I know its not part of the actual shoe review but just ideas to consider for the serious athletes.",173819363

526628,5,10/09/2017,"Awesome Shoe! Purchased this shoe after having a great experience with other colors of the flyknit racer. Comfort is top notch, and does not create fatigue when you wear it all day. Extremely light and at times can feel like there is nothing on your feet. The color way on this specific pair pops, especially in sunlight. The flyknit upper is extremely flexible and well ventilated. Running is this shoe is a very enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend this shoe for anyone who runs a lot, or a little, this shoe will meet your needs.",173072592
526628,5,09/23/2017,Great shoe I have close to 400 miles on my current pair and still going strong.  Toe is narrow compared to the free flyknit.  Love the flyknit.,170274791
526628,2,09/13/2017,"120 bucks for 4 weeks ? Indeed ?! My previous sneakers was Free Flyknit and i liked it for the light weight, comfort and breathability, so i decided to buy something like it. Since Flyknit Racer was look alike and even more breathable, choice was made. In 4 weeks of wearing small hole appeared at the nose ! Terrible !",169975635
526628,5,09/12/2017,"Great! Super comfortable for walking and the all black, you can wear with a suit and still be comfortable. Very airy shoe too, so only good in warm climates so I can imagine it won't be very durable. It is small and narrow, but that's fine with me.",169942969
526628,1,09/02/2017,Poor Durability I purchased these shoes this summer and already the left sole is coming coming off. The top and bottom of the sole is completely detaches.

I see it on people all the time so I figured I would give it a shot. Definitely was nervous about the Unisex fit but it fit my foot like a glove. Seems to run narrow which wasn't a problem for me but something to be cautious of. Very comfortable and springy. Ultra light weight. The upper is incredibly comfortable and conforms to your feet. I cannot say enough good things. Definitely recommend (they are stylish too which is an absolute plus).",167736767

I was hoping for a better quality as the price is so high but i was very disappointed. Its such a let down as I found them very comfortable and loved how they fitted me so perfectly. Will certainly not buy again, they didn't even last me 2 months.",166757422
526628,5,07/23/2017,"Great summer running shoe I've been a loyal Nike Pegasus fan for years and decided to try another shoe and picked up the Nike Flyknit racer. Skeptical at first because I heard they run small and narrow so I went a half size up and they fit perfect. I'm 100 miles in and I've run two half-marathon's in them and I couldn't have been happier. I love my pegasus but in the summer when doing long runs in the heat, I rather run in my Nike Flyknit racer's due to the ventilation and the flywire to really lock down your feet. Comfort is good and having a zoom air unit in the shoe goes along way during long runs. Great and amazing shoe and also very stylish as well. Good job Nike!!!",166754095
526628,1,07/22/2017,"Very Poor Quality I received the shoes on June 27. By July 22, the sole was already separating from the bottom of the shoe. I run twice per week... so have warn around 6 or 7 times. I am returning, but for this price I would expect much better quality.",166705616

526628,1,07/20/2017,Bad Stability This shoe offers bad stability to your heel. If you land awkward on the heel it will give out and cause your ankle to twist. The shoe is also very narrow and makes your foot look very small. I sent this shoe back and bought the Nike Free Run Flyknit. I love the free runs because of the stability and durability that they offer. This shoe is way too expensive for what it provides and there are many other better options for cheaper.,166573862
526628,2,07/16/2017,"Great look, very poor durability Shoes look great, no question. But they just don't hold up, even under very light use. I have 5(!) broken lace loops and the flyknit fabric has opened up into big holes at the toe on both shoes (two on my right shoe). Really disappointing. I otherwise hold onto shoes for much longer, but now I'm left having to buy a new pair just over a year in. Love Nike, but these should hold up much better than this.",166375527

Usually run on road and I find these shoes very cushioned, well wrapped around your foot so they dont feel like theyll slip off.

However, there is very little support for the ankles and heels which I felt particularly affected my knees post-race. Saying that, I can see why they have produced such a shoe; it is incredibly light, hard-wearing and there is excellent breathability. However I would never consider personally running in them everyday- the LunarEpic technology is far more sturdier for continuous use.",158728508
526628,3,04/10/2017,"Amazing comfort-- not so great durability I love the style and comfort of this shoe. I always get compliments when I wear them, and I have recommended them to everyone who asks me about them.

Personally, I don't enjoy them for running, but I love them for training in the gym, and casual walks.

However, I blew a hole in the front of the shoe within 2 months of owning these. I think I ran in them once! I pretty much only walked around the gym in these. The durability of the shoe is the only reason I haven't bought these in more colours.",158027474

526628,1,03/31/2017,"Great fashion design, but uncomfortable and non-durable for running It's a lovely design, and I love the colors - but I am slightly disappointed with this being called a ""running"" shoe. It may very well be that the Air Zoom unit helps you to get your feet moving faster, but the balance and the grip is not good at all. I have several Nike flyknit running shoes (the previous models) and I am very satisfied, but this one - I've been running with it for more than a month now (3-4 runs a week), and my feet and legs hurt, my pace is not as with my other shoes. And the half marathon I did in these shoes was my worst...

And as it seems several other Nike customers noticed, the durability is quite low with the sole peeling off. I will remain a loyal Nike runner as I do have faith in your products, but I am sorry to say this expensive shoe is really not that great for running. Looking forward to the new models!",156606461
526628,5,03/26/2017,Casual running shoes are where it's at The casual aspect of the flyknit racer really makes it easy to pair with anything. I picked up the blue/yellow colorway on launch day and it fits with a ton of outfit options with ease. The only downside to these was finding the right size for me. I normally always wear a 11.5 but with these I highly recommend going a half size up.,155991697

I got womens size 6, and it is true to size. I have the freerun flyknit and the racers feel similar to them. But I was looking at the details on the shoe closely, especially the white nike sign. It looks like it was just painted with white paint, looks cheap. Is that how you guys put on your nike signs because with the price we pay for the shoe, I would expect the quality of details to be consistent with the rest of the shoe.",152364370

i get many compliments on them when i wear them out in public.
I wouldn't say they're the most comfortable if you're going to be standing or on your feet for long periods, which makes sense since they're designed for racing.
I have friends who love how they look but don't wear them cuz they think they make their feet look too small. I think they look best with shorts OR with slim pants or joggers, that way people can see the entire shoe and they don't look too small.",151910939

Though unlike other nike flyknits, these don't have an underlining, so, they're transparent on various points of the sneaker. They're extremely comfortable and lightweight. They do run small despite what other people state they run true to size. I recommend going to a nearby Nike store to try em on. Otherwise buy at least a half size larger than your typical size.

I recommended going true to size. The only knock on this shoe is that after a few wears there is already a hole in front of the shoe by my big toe. I havent beaten these things and have only worn them 6 times and this is disheartening considering the price tag. If they were more durable they might go down as one of my favorite shoes of all time.",151366992
526628,4,02/10/2017,"A shoe that fits perfectly I recently purchased the Nike Flyknit racer, I run at least 25 miles a week and I run both outdoors and sometimes on the treadmill, and I have to say I have never felt any other shoe that fits perfectly on my foot like this one. I rated the Flyknit based on its comfortableness, breathability and its fit, to start off as I said before this shoe is very comfortable whenever and wherever I run I never get any bruises or scratches on my heel and my toes unlike my other running and training shoes, using the Flyknit while running it feels so comfortable that it is as if I am not wearing shoes at all and I find it amazing at how light it is. In addition, I also did a speed test on it using my old Nike LunarGlide shoes and for me LunarGlide is also very comfortable but it sometimes gives me bruises and scratches when I am running, after the speed test the result of my test was I was 2.35 seconds faster using my new Flyknit racer and I came off with no bruises or scratches! Although I do admit there are some durability problems on the shoes after two weeks of using it I see small scratches on the front sole of the shoe, although this does not bother me too much.
Using the Flyknit racer I also do not get too much of a sweaty feet as I did before, I mean if you are running your feet are going to sweat and all, but I noticed after using the Flyknit the shoes itself has a lot of holes that let air circulate and go through my feet easier therefore I don’t feel as hot running with Flyknit unlike my other shoes and because of this my feet sweat less. In addition, it really helps me up my speed and endurance if my feet don’t get too hot easily. Finally the fit, I really like the feel and the fit of the Flyknit the first time I took it out on a run it didn’t feel too well and it’s kind of small for me, but after the run it did not give me bruises or scratches so I decided to give it another chance after two or three uses it got really comfortable and fits really easily on my foot.
Overall I am giving this shoe a rating of four, I hope you make more shoes like this. Great job Nike!",150340056
526628,3,02/05/2017,"Beautiful shoe, but just not durable. I recently found out about these shoes and loved instantly. I wore them most days of the week to class, and would constantly get compliments walking around campus but after about two and half months I noticed a hole forming on them which kept growing. I wore them really casually, and rarely for running or other sports, but I still got the hole. I love some of the other color ways, and just how light and comfortable they are, but I don't know if I can justify paying that much for a shoe that will only last a few months.",149750743

Now, the NIKE FLYKNIT RACER (size7.5) with black thin ankle socks.

The NIKE FLYKNIT RACER has the foot arc that makes the fitting more comfortable than the Flyknit 1.0. Also the NIKE FLYKNIT RACER has holes above the toe area and the mid side of the shoe. So far the shoe hasn't given me any sores from wearing too long. Yes these running shoes seems like a 6.5 to actual feet size. there's i think half a inch to 3-quater of a inch room from the big toe to the wall.

The shoe is light and has a great comfort, but my shoe's knit started to tear apart/get really loose. I'm what you might call a sneaker head, so I do take care of my shoes and even though I did, it did not help with this shoe.

However after only owning them for approximately 3 months the black rubber sole has started to pull away from the molded section of sole rendering them useless. 
Same as all the other reviews here, I would buy another pair but for the cost I would of expected them to at least last a year considering the type of usage they get. I have owned much cheaper trainers, and much cheaper Nike trainers and had better life out of them. Definitely a shame!",143589839

They are incredibly light and supremely comfortable. I like them so much that I recently bought two more pairs. However, since I bought my two new pairs, a number of the flywires on my oldest pair have broken, which is really disappointing because it results in a looser, less supported fit and means that the eyelets will wear out very quickly.

Its such a shame as its really obvious when wearing socks but I still want to wear them. Im reluctant to buy another pair as the price is quite high. I really wish I could give these shoes a 5 star rating as they're my favourite pair of nikes ever! But the massive gaping hole prevents me. I don't even run that much, and haven't used them during intense exercise so its such a shame they aren't durable which is uncharacteristic of nike.

I got a size 10.5 and after sprinting for 3 years in them they feel like an 11. The midsole also softens up a lot overtime so if you use these to run the midsole will get softer over time and the fly knit will become very flexible and soft. The only thing that I would change is how the they don't hug your feet as the flyknit 4.0s do. Overall great shoe that will not fail.,130506429

For reference, I am a 6 foot 200lb runner, typically running half marathons at an 8 minute 30 second pace. My foot is average to slightly wider, but not much. The platform underfoot is narrow, but adequate and supportive as a road running shoe. I wouldnt wear this as a cross trainer, as it is too unstable and not designed for that. This is an all out speed shoe. The zoom air in heel and forefoot feels great, even after 16 miles. I will be wearing these for my upcoming marathon. I first tested these on a short 6 mile tempo run. They felt great. The next test was a very hilly half marathon with sections on dirt road that was strewn with large rocks (a few inches across) from rain the days prior. Despite the uneven surfaces I felt fast and stable. At the end of the race my feet felt good, and I had enough energy from not lugging heavy shoes to attack the hills at a 7 minute pace. The responsiveness of this shoe was great, and the breathability was appreciated on a 90 degree day.

Mostly I really enjoy wearing them because they look awesome, are super lightweight and breathable, and have a reasonable amount of cushioning.

My only complaints are regarding the midsole construction: 

1) I feel a pretty sudden dip right in the middle of my arch. Like the heel offset isn't a smooth decline.

2) when I'm walking I feel my ankles dip inward rather than being supported down a neutral stride. 

Anyway, neither of those problems are bad enough to prevent me enjoying the shoes, I would just look out for them when you try them on, especially if you do plan to run in them.",114903073

526628,5,06/15/2016,Amazing Shoe All Around Got this shoe because all my friends kept talking about them and so I did. When you first put on the shoe it doesnt feel that great but overtime when you wear it the flyknit sort of adjusts to your foot and that is the reason I doubled up on those. They are a great shoe for running and also a lifestyle shoe with an edgy look. Definitely recommend it ;),114764649

526628,5,06/03/2016,"Beautiful and Functional shoe This shoe is light but sturdy! I use it for my weight lifting, my sprints, and my stair climbs. It's a light shoe which makes it easy to go fast and supportive with box jumps and ankle support in general.

The top profile is a nice clean shape, which is especially important to me, since that's the only view I see when I'm wearing them, and usually a deficiency in most sneaker design. The flyknit uppers fit like a glove. It also weighs nearly nothing, and though the platform is on the narrower side, it's more than enough support on runs, and very comfortable. Easily one of my favorite running shoes.",113265863
526628,5,06/01/2016,Lovin' It! Nike Flyknit Racer is very light and very comfortable to wear. You feel bouncy when you are walking/running because of the zoom unit in the front. awesome shoes! Highly recommended,113154354

Atleast go a half size up...",111046601
526628,5,05/19/2016,Best Nike shoe Ive ever purchased LOOOOVVVVEEE this shoe. It is actually way more comfortable than the flyknit 3.0 and much lighter. The narrow fit is very flattering.,111020060
526628,5,05/19/2016,Awesome shoe but.. These shoes are great only problem I have is my feet are wider than the average person so I have to go a .5 size up. Other than that theyre perfect,110986206
526628,3,05/13/2016,"NARROW Fit is subjective depending on foot shape, but for someone with a normal to slightly wide foot, these kicks are too narrow. The shoes pinches the sides of my feet and when I walk, my arch area spills over the shoe. The cushioning is also neutral, meaning it's not as plush as bouncy as say, the Lunar line. Positives- lightweight, killer aesthetics. Comfort is soso due to the stiff sole and narrow last.",110333654
526628,4,05/05/2016,"Narrow I love the look and weight of these shoes, but boy are they narrow! I went up a full size for the sake of width (I'm okay with going up 1/2 a size... but not a FULL size). Of course that meant that the shoes themselves are now too long and not really feasible for running. 

I skill like the looks and wear them often if I don't have to move around too much.",109661657

Im usually a size 6 but 6.5 fit better.",107034096
526628,5,04/07/2016,"Great Casual Shoe, Even Better Running Shoe When I work out I usually don't jog, but hit the weights instead. I do sweat a lot and having an airy shoe made out of flyknit helps a ton and makes working out even more comfortable. I love the close fit of the shoe. It's not tight, but feels like it's apart of your foot. I went a half size down to get that feeling. These do run narrow, but even with my wider foot the shoe feels great. When I have jogged in them they're fantastic. Having the zoom unit in the heel makes the shoe feel super comfortable while jogging, almost making it feel like you're being propelled forward with each stride. Outside of the gym, the shoe is still amazing. The Neo Turquoise color way is easy on the eyes. I can throw these on with jeans or shorts and I'll still look good. Solid 9/10.",106687177
526628,5,03/28/2016,"Great racing shoe These shoes are in the top 3 best racing shoe I've owned. These shoes are light, tight fit and the mesh makes it nice on those long, hot runs. I usually can only run 6 miles in a 4 mm drop but I feel no pain until that 20 mile mark. The wedge in the sole makes for amazing comfort. I only have 200 miles on these shoes so far, I try to keep them for racing since they are half the weight of training shoes. I read reviews that people were not satisfied with this shoe but I love them, I run 5ks to half marathons in them and plan on using in my next marathon. If a person has a wide foot or lands on the outside of their foot running I could see that they may have a little discomfort.",105926355
526628,1,03/21/2016,"Worst running shoe to ever touch my feet. I had very high hopes for this product. It looked like a well built shoe. The only problem is that this hugged my foot like nothing I have ever experienced, even with going a half size up. While I do admit that I have a slightly wide foot this is unnaceptle. Also my foot felt like it was about to go off the side of the sole, being it so small.",105424266
526628,5,03/13/2016,"Life changing! I. LOVE. THESE. SHOES. They are so light I have to get used to it! Its like wearing nothing at all! They fit perfectly too (Had to order a half size up). I can definitely wear these when I work out, run errands and even w/ my cute dresses! ;) These shoes are definitely life-changing! P.s. Nike, please make more sizes 4 and 4.5 so us girls could order more of them! Ive been checking day & night for weeks for the Oreo color and still come up empty handed. So sad... Got them in Orca and would like to order the Oreos too. Thanks!",104806007
526628,3,03/04/2016,Very Disappointed I bought these first from nike.com my true sz is a 13 so thats what I purchased because the nike rep told me they run small. So I received the shoe and it's huge and doesn't fit. I got a 12 and the insole of the shoe feels cheaply made and it is so hard I would not recommend this I love the way they look but they're very uncomfortable.,104149954
526628,1,03/03/2016,"Looks good, feels bad I bought these in September, 2015 and they were the worst shoes to break in, however after a few days of wear they stretched to my foot. The shoes are very narrow and my foot feels like its spilling inwards at the arch. Theyre also very uncomfortable to walk around in after about 2 hours or so, which isnt good. I was much more satisfied with my free runs which provided comfort for hours on end. I honestly dont even want to run in these because Im afraid of how bad my feet could be hurting, considering how much they hurt just from walking! Great show look wise, but very uncomfortable, I only wear them around to look good now.",104086308
526628,5,03/01/2016,Sprint champion I find the flyknit racer to be the best option for short/fast distance races. Theyre also the most stylish runner on the planet.,103966192
526628,5,02/24/2016,"My favorite racing flat This is now my preferred racing flat. The shoe holds up well during a marathon, even for a bigger guy like myself. You will definitely feel the road while also feeling light and fast in these. Also, while the shoe appears narrower than other Nikes, I find that my normal Nike running shoe size works for this model.

One word of caution. I'm on my third pair of Flyknit Racers, with the most recent color scheme being the black/white/white ones. I noticed Nike used a flatter pair of laces on this shoe compared to prior colors/models. In my last race, these laces came untied around mile 5. Perhaps Nike will read this and switch back to the rounder laces.",103413652
526628,5,02/20/2016,"Flyknits I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone who lives in California or where they see sun all the time. I live in Seattle and it rains here often and still love these shoes.

The shoes do run very narrow and a little bit small. Ex: I wear a 9 and in Racers I like to go a half size up that may also be to the fact that the shoe itself runs very narrow.

Overall very awesome shoe, looks great, feels great, and it is so lightweight. Every sneakerhead should own a couple of these shoes.",103084873
526628,5,02/19/2016,Magnificent shoe! Beautiful and comfortable shoe. I bought to run in but love them so much I just wear them casually. I love Nike.,102986909

I wear them to work, to train in the weight room, and to do cardio. They fit perfectly, have a stable base, and are breathable. Yes, they are a little pricey, but the quality is so worth it. Nike has done it again.",102574380
526628,5,02/14/2016,"Gorgeous every day shoe! I got black/white and citrus and both pairs go with everything! I work at a start up so am usually in athletic wear or casual wear, and they look chic and smart for office to board meeting. I'm a 7.5 and both the 6 and 6.5 men's sizing fit me, but after speaking with the Nike running consultant, I was advised to go up to 6.5 mens (8 womens) since I was using them as a lifestyle shoe. He said the snug sock-like fit would be for competitive racing only. I'm glad I sized up because my heel would lift while walking in the smaller size (because it was tighter in the toe box). I have a thumbprint space at the toe and my feet sit well. Wish there were pastel colorways or Crimson/Volt/Blk!",102293815
526628,5,02/14/2016,Love it I have had this shoe for a while now and I love it. It is very comfortable although it does run pretty narrow (but it still felt amazing.)

526628,5,01/30/2016,"Flyknit Racer I picked up a pair of these after trying on a few different pairs of running sneakers from Nike and I must say, these blew them all away. Obviously everyone's foot is sized and shaped differently, but for someone who does not need any type of corrective arch, this shoe is magnificent. It's light enough that you feel like you're wearing a sock, and it will not come off while running (even though it feels so!) Might have to pick up some more",101047274

I wear a size 8.5 in women and had to get .5 size bigger (9) I do have narrow feet and the shoe is very narrow I don't know if I would recommend to a wide a foot.

At first when I put the Racers on I thought they werent true to size, but they are. The fit was very snug, but purposely. Once you go running your foot will move slightly and the shoe sort of conforms to your foot. I increased my average mile time by about 10 seconds each mile. Very light, comfortable, and almost feels like youre running barefoot. Nice job with this shoe! Im sure it will be just as durable as the Lunar 2s.",99941548

526628,5,01/03/2016,"Love at first run While the price point may be a little steep it is definitely worth the investment if you are serious about doing long runs. This shoe has plenty of support while also being one of the lightest shoes on the market. I found the shoe to be a tad bit narrow but I have not found it to be the least bit cumbersome. Overall if you are looking for a long distance shoe that is also lightweight with enough support I would definitely recommend this product. I haven't had this shoe for too long so I cannot comment on the durability, however, knowing other people who have used other nike flyknit shoes I am sure they can hold up.",99006919
526628,5,01/01/2016,"These are the bees knees They are very pricy. But they are well worth it. You could but I personally wouldn't use these for any type of running because there are far better, more durable and cheaper shoes available for that. Instead, these are great shoes to slip on and wear on the go. You could wear these with anything. They're extremely lightweight, sleek, very stylish and most of all comfortable. The flyknit is strong and holds up well and they are also easy to clean because of the cloth like material. I wouldn't recommend these to someone with wide feet. They run slightly narrow but if you have normal sized feet GO TRUE TO SIZE. I'm a 10 in pretty much everything and a 10 fits like a glove while wearing thin socks or bare with just enough toe room and your feet will not slip out. If you were to wear these with regular socks a 10.5 would be better, but you would have too much wiggle room with bare/thin/no show socks. If you're still unsure, best to try them on in store. I have 4 pairs and they all still look brand new. Well worth the investment!",98791920

They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I run about 20-25 miles per week both indoors and outdoors. My main complaint of the flyknit is their durability, which is to say they arent durable. Ive had 5 pairs of these and now wearing my 4th which j purchased in August and have logged about 290 miles of running. The sole is in good shape but the upper has already torn in the toe box. Making them basically unusable. Nike fix this please. Cant have sneakers with holes in them.",97261904

526628,4,12/02/2015,"Really comfortable and super light! Bought these because I wanted a lighter pair of running sneakers. Before these I was running in the Nike Flyknit Lunar 3s. These Flyknit Racers feel just like the Lunar 3s when you slip them on but once you start running, you feel a big difference. They hold up great and the insole is pretty comfortable.",96524882
526628,5,12/01/2015,Most comfortable and lightest shoes The shoe is true to size and super comfy. They are so light that I dont even feel like Im wearing anything when I wear them. It looks super stylish and is the best casual shoes to have. I am in love with them.,96468336

526628,5,11/18/2015,"Favorite racing shoe Love this shoe, has a firm and responsive outsole with a soft upper. The flyknit material hugs the foot well without being constrictive, which is great when doing longer races. Have run 2 marathons in these and multiple shorter races and they have been comfortable for every race. While they are a little narrow, they fit as expected for a racing shoe and I recommend buying your normal size as the flyknit material will stretch a little. This has definitely become my favorite shoe for racing.",95160992
526628,5,11/17/2015,"Thoughts on the racer, by a racer I primarily use these shoes for urban orienteering races. As a result, I wear them for c. 15 km per race, mainly on road but also with occasional sections of parkland. I have no complaints about the performance of the shoe on any of these surfaces, although they are certainly best suited to road use. They are comfortable over this distance and are very breathable due to the flyknit upper, good for sweat but also rain/puddles/etc.. Very responsive due to light weight and minimal cushioning (on the forefoot, at least). I have described fit as ""neutral"", but would actually say in the heel/mid-foot the shoe is narrow and in the forefoot it is a bit wide. This makes sense what with the racer being a race shoe (forefoot strike), but means that I would never wear them casually as they feel odd/imbalanced to just walk in. My only complaint of the shoe is that--despite being a race shoe--it does not have dual eyelets at the top of the tongue as most running shoes do. These (dual eyelets) allow for a more secure fit/better lockdown around the heel, and although I have been able to somewhat mimic this feature by lacing my shoes in a particular way (see photo), it would be good if Nike would include this feature in the next generation of flyknit racers.",95048575
526628,5,11/17/2015,This product is amazing this product is amazing. I never felt anything like this before! This shoes is really comfortable.,95036952
526628,5,11/15/2015,"Foot Heaven These shoes are unbeatably comfortable. Super light weight and very stylish. They do run a bit small in my opinion, I recommend going up half a size or a full size. I go up a full size being that the shoe is pretty narrow and I do have a wide foot. Great for runners and even better for someone who just wants to get out of the weekly work boot and slide your foot into some foot heaven. Only thing Id have to complain about is the shoes warmth. Clearly not a shoe for a cold or rainy day. Perfect summertime and spring shoe nonetheless.",94840781
526628,5,11/15/2015,"Best shoes of my life These are my favorite pair of shoes. Most comfortable, super light, breezy, and they're durable. I wouldn't do any type of intense training or sprinting in these though. They're more for casual wear or running.",94836978
526628,4,11/13/2015,"Color combination I really like the color combination, that makes it very soft and light. It is maskuline but at the same time also a bit feminine. But thats the good thing when the product living in ambivalent condition. This shoe paradoxally great. It is also comfortable and light. The inprovement since the previous flyknit is also decent. The fabric is more solid and look more durable.",94710883
526628,5,11/10/2015,"OMG best running shoe ever!!! I just received my Flyknit Racers last week and immediately put them to the test. I ran with them on the treadmill and omg they are so comfortable. Did 3 miles in them and they held up very well. No pain or discomfort. When you are running its like you have nothing on but your socks literally and they have so much cushion. Havent ran with them outside yet but ran errands in them and they feel just as comfortable as when I was running. But be warned as living in the Midwest, temperatures tend drop this time of year and with the proofrated holes in the toe of the shoe, your feet may get a little cold. But none the less still a great shoe. Sizing is spot on also. I normally wear the Nike Free Runs and exact same size I wear in those is the same size I bought the Flyknits in. Do not go half size down!!! Your feet will be too tight in the shoe. Bought the wrong size the first time and had to exchange. Definitely recommend. Worth every penny. Good job Nike, keep up the good work. Will definitely buy another pair again.",94382083

526628,5,10/28/2015,My favorite ! I love the racers because they're so comfy and because I own a few already. I felt like I needed to get this color way. I wear them when I'm running and doing some cardio but they are so comfy for lifting as well. If I could. I'd buy all the colorway possible but that's impossible because sneaker heads like to buy them and resell them for higher price. Definitely one of my favorite. Will likely buy any new colors they come out with just because of how light and how much I like wearing them. They look nice when I wear them to run errands as well.,92882189

It's perverse how good the shoe is sculpted. The flyknit tech is amazing at ventilating, staying light & distributing pressure on a variety of foot shapes. The only caveat is, if you're planning on casually wearing with cotton socks, SIZE UP a half. If you're wearing them for sport with sock liners, they're true to size.

526628,1,08/26/2015,"Beautiful shoes, unfortunately that's all I loved. Got these in the Oreo 2.0 on restock and was super excited. Unfortunately upon their arrival I was severly disappointed. Purchased as a casual, good looking sneaker and as beautiful as they are, they weren't what I had hoped for.

For starters, the shoes are extremely narrow. This may not be a problem for everyone, but I have extremely flat feet, so the insides of my feet where I lack an arch came spilling over the sole and pulled on the fabric on the inside of the shoe. When looking at the shoe, you can even see that the insole spills over at this point.

My second issue was how flimsy the material was. This is mostly due to my own lack of research but the shoes are extremely light. This wouldn't be a downside, but all the material is the flyknit upper which is completely see-through in many places and not very sturdy.

Finally, I didn't find the soles themselves, ignoring the arch issue, very comfortable. They okay, but nothing to write home about. All in all a very good looking shoe, but if you have flat feet or have feet at all on the wider side, avoid like the plague. For reference, the Roshe One fits me perfectly in width and length.",86660377

traction - 7/10 (not really that important since youll be running on all different surfaces)
fit - 9/10 (TTS, pretty good lock down, no complaints)
cushion - 8/10 (i would give a better rating, but i dont know how long the lunar will last)
breathability is 10/10 (lots of vents, perfect for those with sweaty feet)

526628,5,07/17/2015,"Sneaker and running shoe with great style This was my first flyknit shoe and also the most expensive Nike shoe I've bought so far. I was a bit skeptical about the actual color, fit and feel before wearing it, but it all changed upon arrival. Bright citrus/blue lagoon looks very nice and has great style. The shoe feels very cushioned both forefoot and back and the construction of flykni makes for a snug, extremely breathable and light shoe. The flyknit is very thin and when barefeet, you can feel the wind by just walking around. One thing to notice, the toe box is very narrow so if you have big wide feet, maybe consider half size up to get a more roomy with perhaps less pressure on your toes. Also, the shape of the heel does not provide good lockdown so you might feel your feel loose and the thin flyknit upper might not last long upon heavy use on it. Only complains I have is the colorways they release; they need to release more and better colors to the public. I'd say this shoe is for everyone who is looking for shoes with style in a running shoe or athletes with great cushion and lightweight feel.",82865981

The sizing was a little tricky, but before I ordered them online, I tried them on at the store. I would say there is a difference in size depending on how you would like to wear the sneaker. If you are wearing them just for style and you don't normally wear thick socks then the shoe fits true to size. If you are wearing them to work out and you wear thicker socks like I do, then you will need a half size bigger than your normal size.",81927324

Stretches, with my feet as I run. That is the reason I continue to purchase new releases, like your favorite pair of jeans, you try to buy more than one. I wear whichever style, depending on my activities. For longer distances and races, I wear the flyknit lunars, shorter distances I wear racers, etc. I recommend them to anyone.

I can wiggle my toes to much. How are they supposed to fit? Are they supposed to be like a sock? Should I go back to the 7.5?",76935432

526628,5,04/04/2015,"Best running shoes I have owned in a while These shoes reminded me of the Nike Marathoners of some years ago. I run track, I am a 400 meter runner and I use these type of shoes to do many of my training sets in the track and on the street. The shoes fit like a globe and they are really light and versatile and minimal which I like. I would recommend them without hesitation. The outsole is not to soft nor to hard, I think they are perfect all in all",76672968
526628,5,04/01/2015,"Excellent Road Racer I purchased the Flyknit Racer for 1-2 faster runs (6:20 - 6:40 mi pace over 6 - 9 miles) I complete each week. I have put fifty miles on them now, and I am convinced that they are excellently designed shoes. They are extremely light, a bit narrow, provide an excellent ""sock-like,"" foot-hugging feel (the flywire setup works excellently here), and have a base that is responsive but not too firm for longer runs. I am a forefoot striker and the foam/zoom unit combo in these shoes feels a bit different than any other shoe I have run in. They are firm but give just enough upon impact and provide a very minor ""bounce"" that I really enjoy. However, there isn't a lot under your foot. You can feel exactly what type of surface you are running on when wearing these shoes (in a good way).

I also run in the Zoom Elite 7s and the Pegasus 31s and the I find the firmness of the Flyknit Racers to be in between these two models (the Zoom Elite 7 being firmer and the Pegasus 31 being softer). The only aspect of this shoe that I was initially concerned about was stability. As I stated previously, the base of the Flyknit Racers is relatively narrow. When I first wore them taking tight turns and running through grass or rough terrain felt strange, but I adjusted very quickly and it has become a non-issue. (These are unquestionably road racers though, and I would never recommend them for anything but an occasional jaunt through grass or gravel.)

All this to say, that if you are a neutral, forefoot (or maybe midfoot) striker looking for an excellent shoe for fast days/races on pavement, I strongly recommend trying this shoe (if you are willing to stomach the price).

P.S. After 50 miles, my pair of Flyknit Racers shows very little wear. I anticipate getting 300 to 400 miles out of them before coughing up another arm, leg, and first born for pair 2.",76516374
526628,5,03/18/2015,"Super light racing shoe Loved these shoes right out of the box. They are the only shoe where I don't need to go up a half size to prevent my toes from touching while running because even when they do touch, there's no pain, no toenail loss, no blisters. They are super light, stretch nicely and feel like slippers yet offer enough protection for heavy mileage road use. The lacing is perfect without excess pressure on the top of my foot, which tends to be a problem in most other shoes except my Altra's. I have not yet worn them for my upcoming Boston marathon but have no doubt they will perform well.",75843357

526628,5,12/28/2014,"My Favorites I bought my racers about a year ago. They are about as light and responsive of a shoe as there is in the market.

Obviously the flyknit material makes the uppers very breathable and form fitting to your foot. Although tying the laces even slightly too snug will irritate the tops of your feet.... So getting the laces just right is one of the most important things with these shoes.

I have been pleasantly surprised by the durability. I was mainly concerned with the uppers but they have proven to last.

I own way more shoes than a man should but these have been my go to shoes even for every day wear. They literally have become more comfortable the longer I have had them. If the traction wasn't wearing off the bottoms from so much use I would just keep using them.",69678096
526628,5,12/24/2014,"One of my favs I have 3 pairs of the Flyknit Racers and I choose them over any other shoe for multiple reasons. They are very comfortable, especially after multiple wears. They are extremely durable with over 400 miles tracked from running 3-13 miles at a time in all conditions, walking to work and just daily activies . Even though your feet can get wet in the rain easily, it is not something I would complain about unless it is before work. Plus, they still are in presentable shape. I would love to see the Multi-color make a comeback so I can actually get a pair this time.

Now only if NIKEiD was an option in these. Talk about a Game Changer.",69511055
526628,4,12/06/2014,"Lightweight and Responsive This is my second flyknit, my first one are the lunar one+ and this shoe is much more lightweight and much more responsive than the lunar, and they also have better looks than the lunar, but for comfortability this shoe is just much less comfortable, it runs narrow and it just hurts my foot when trying them for the first runs, but as it breaks down it become much more comfortable and as the shoes were directed for racing I don't have any negative complaints, recommended for under half-marathon races",68201223

Also, the traction is amazing. I only have two minor complaints. One, the laces come untied easily, so you should probably double or triple not them. Two, I got the white/volt/black color way, and the black part on the midsole chips a little bit after about a month in a half, but you won't notice it. (Thats the only reason I didn't give it the best durability rating.) Overall, this is an amazing shoe with everything anybody would want in a high quality running shoe.

This is by far the most uncomfortable Nike shoe I have worn. My sole feels like it has bumps in it. I hoped I could break them in but that was not the case. The shoe is very narrow and I never had a problem with Nike's width. The shoe is so uncomfortable I find I'm losing 30 seconds on my mile cause my feet hurt so bad. I would recommend another shoe.",67172776
526628,5,11/11/2014,"My favorite. This is my favorite shoe of all time. I've owned a lot of Nike's but realized that this one is special. I'm a lightweight runner who trains for marathons throughout the year. It fits me perfectly. It's extremely lightweight and comfortable. I'm a distance runner that doesn't require too much cushioning. I love how Nike doesn't try to change the design of this shoe. Keep an extra pair of nikes with you if it's raining outside. The breathability of this shoe is so great, you won't want to get them wet. Enjoy.",67085303

I was afraid since I am a pretty big guy that they would not hold up, but that has not been the case. I wish Nike would add these to the ID program.

It is hard to go from wearing this shoe to any other running shoe because they are so light! I own a majority of the other Flyknit shoes and these are by far the go to.

Everything from the fit to the colour ways appeal to me there is just one problem. I think being a heavy forefoot lander and not as efficient as I would like, the soles are not gonna be around for long. They show signs of wear after 2 weeks and that's not good considering the price. Apart from that they are the best shoes I have ever ran in. I'm just gonna save them for special races ;)",65601791

526628,5,09/30/2014,"Worth the price PSA: Be aware of your foot size/width before purchasing. I have a narrow foot with a high arch, went down 1/2 a size (Normally wear 11s, got 10.5s), and the sizing was perfect. If you have a normal-width foot, I'd recommend ordering your true size, or go a 1/2 size up if you have wide feet. I prefer not wearing socks when using these, whether it be to walk around in or do tempo runs in. The shoe is designed to fit like a sock, so the extra protection felt unnecessary. The Flywire and upper material have held up nicely, despite the deceptively lightweight and breathable upper. If you want to get the most these shoes have to offer, do not do every training run in them; reserve them for tempos, speedwork, or races. I've already ordered my second pair and look forward to their arrival. Highly satisfied with this shoe.",65553801
526628,5,09/30/2014,"What more could anyone want? When I opened the box and picked these up I was amazed at how light they were and I began to think how something this light can actually provide stability; but they do.

Aesthetics aside, this product is the absolute premium in running shoes. I find them to be supportive and light, but surprisingly sturdy. Also, they're comfortable without socks-- huge plus for me, because who has time to find a matching pair? ;P

I use these sneakers primarily for HIIT running. I'm also training for the ING Miami Half Marathon, and these are just a dream to wear. I don't even want to take them off.

As far as sizing goes, I'm a women's size 9 regular in Nike Free 4.0. I have these in a size 8, and they fit perfectly.

My only complaint is that they ran out of the purple ones in my size. C'mon Nike, get on that!! (And also, thanks for the wonderful sneaker :))",65259505

526628,5,07/03/2014,"My new BFF I was lucky enough to find this shoe at the SF store and I fell in love. Having grown up as a sprinter at the high school and collegiate levels, I was used to quick, light racing flats. And I'm constantly on the search for the best, lightest, coolest shoe. With the Flyknit Racer, Nike has truly outdone themselves! These are super light, feel like clouds, and make you run like the wind (ok, so maybe some hyperbole). But they do make you feel like you can do anything! They're also pretty cushy for such a light shoe. The only problem is I wear a small size and it's so so hard to find them. I'm considering selling some organs so I can find a pair on the black market! Nike, Nike, please, please make more of this miraculous shoe! Before I do something desperate!",62317903

They are more narrow than most other runners and flyknits. I normally wear a 10.5 but both pairs of these I have in 11 (partially because the upsale prices and limited availability of this style) but I don't regret the half size bump up. I cannot say enough about the style and jaw dropping detail of these kicks. You really have to see them in person to believe it. Only bad thing is the super limited availability and aftermarket resale $200-$300 is crazy, I would have this shoe in 5 different color ways if not for that.",59540664
526628,4,05/31/2014,"Good Shoe Personally I love the flyknits, however my black and white volt have some flaws in the stitching. Also, I noticed that a black layer helps protect the heel of the shoe, however the black shows through the white side, which makes the shoe look kinda :l . Other than that, a great shoe nonetheless! Just make sure to look through the shoe to see if it's all perfect!",59497297

The shoes feel excellent. They provide just the right breathability and little weight without compromising support and comfort. My only problem is that I can't seem to get a second pair! They sell out really quick and Nike doesn't replenish much stock. Worst of all, most of the shoes end up being resold for much, much higher and most of those who actually need it for running won't be able to take advantage of it. Nike needs to create a policy where you can only buy one shoe of any particular model/color per person. I want, scratch that, NEED a pair of the white/black/volt (Oreo) color way!",59251632

526628,5,05/20/2014,"Ultimate Racing Shoes! My daily trainers are Flyknit Lunar and for distance up to 13.1 miles, I use Lunarglide 5. The reasons why I choose them type are the cushions and support they give to my arch, since I had arch pains when it comes to the wrong type of shoes. I tried the Flyknit Racer in hope to improve my race result, considering there must be a reason Nike specify this type as racing shoes. Took these Racer to a 10 k race last week and feet felt amazing! My time improved by 5 mins and I didn't feel any sore, pain or fatigue after the race. I would recommend these trainers for those who need cushions yet longing for a pair of lightweight trainers. I'm not sure if these Racer can accommodate 13.1-mile distance, but for some 15 km, dont doubt the Flyknit Racer. It's also great to wear with jeans or capris. Love!",58851041

If you plan on competing with them i would go a HALF SIZE UP to give you a little bit more room.",58762648
526628,5,05/05/2014,"Great shoe, satisfied with product and feels great The netting around the shoe is very comfortable and as you tighten the laces it squeezes perfectly around the shape of your foot therefore it is a great shoe for people with both small and wide feet. Also there is a padding in the heel of the foot that provides maximum support so you don't roll your ankle while doing sprints or turning while running. The laces are great and durable. The sole provides great cushioning so you don't land to hard but at the same time gives you enough power to push into your next stride. I own the yellow/black/white color way and they're perfect at running at dusk because the yellow helps them stand out so you don't run into cars or bikers. I've also had several people take pictures of these shoes so they could buy them too because they very much liked the color way and design of the shoe.",58153317

I envision using this shoe for up to a half marathon distance, not sure if I'd try a full marathon; not quite enough cushion. I plan to give them a try on a 20 miler coming soon though. Soft upper allows for my wide feet (which normally need a wider shoe size) to fit comfortably. Comfortable heel and tongue as well. The only improvement I suggest is to add the extra heel cinch holes that most shoes have for lacing to help keep the heel snugged up tight. The shoe laces are plenty long to accomodate this. I did order a half size big because of previous experience with Nike's running narrow on me. The overall fit is great! Can't wait to do some racing in them.",57825443

Look-wise, my favorite Nike shoe in a long time. Best looking flyknit also IMO. They have a very sleek looking shape comparewd to the Lunars and Trainers.

Comfort-wise, they are SUPER light. I thought the box was empty when I bought my first pair. Wear these with dri-fit socks and it's the most breathable thing you could probably buy. Sucks in cold MA winter weather though.

Only downfall with the shoe that I can see is the delicacy of the flyknits in general and their tendency to get dirty easily. No creasing is really possible with these either, but they tend to fold up a tiny bit on the tip of the toe when you put them on; it's hard to explain. Not a big deal to me though.

They're light as air and, so far, are holding together well.
I use them primarily for skipping rope and lifting and they give the support I need.
There are holes around the front and sides that are just large enough so your sock color shows. I'm guessing it's for better ventilation and to make the shoes even lighter. Made me more conscious of matching my socks, but, other than that, are the best pair of shoes I've owned yet.",46480874

526628,4,09/27/2013,Very Comfortable These shoes are ready to go right out of the box. Harldy any breaking in to do other than running in them enough that they mold to your feet. I am training for my second marathon and have been using them to train in and will be using them to run it. Very light weight and comfy which comes in handy after you are 18 miles into a 22 mile run. They don't weigh your feet down like other shoes.,46393950
526628,5,09/26/2013,"If your body can handle it, these are the best Flyknit racers are great, however they are exactly that racers. Do not buy these thinking that you can use them as all around trainers, they are purpose built for running. You wouldn't take an Indy 500 car out in stop and go traffic, don't try and use these for the elliptical or basic training. RUN in them.

As far as the shoe goes they fit true to size, maybe slightly narrow, which is fine as I have narrow feet. They take a run or two before they feel completely comfortable. The shoes are ideal for a mid or front foot striker. Seeing as there is little cushioning I think that Flyknit racers would put too much strain on the knees for a heel striker.

When running Flyknits feel very responsive giving lots of road feedback and spring to a stride. I would suggest taking it a little slow when first trying out these shoes on a run. Flyknit racers really come alive when you are running quickly feeling planted, almost like spikes, yet giving an extraordinarily responsive run.

These are great, but not for everyone. If you are a first time runner I would suggest free runs over these. But if you can handle them, get ready for a great run!",46368277

526628,3,07/03/2013,"Expensive but not durable I have the Flyknit Volt Racers and they seem to fit perfectly due to the upper-mesh. But these do not have much arch support nor ankle padding to protect your achilles tendon.

If you use a Nike Free Run 3, make sure that your current size fits perfectly because you will need to go a size 0.5 up to get the perfect fit. My Nike Free Run Shield 3+ size 11 was a little too big and I payed for the Flyknit Racers size 11 and they felt perfect, so I'd recommend going a size 0.5 up.

You can buy plenty of other low profile street racing shoes that are equally good if not superior for much less money. However the overall quality of the one piece knit work and the color are fantastic. Nearly impossible to feel the presence of any zoom air cushion, and the entire platform is fairly hard/dense, and the arch seems a little over exaggerated given how it juts up into my foot.

The sole was very narrow under the arch - yet very high off of the ground. It was uncomfortable and unnatural and really messed with my stride.

The tip is very narrow, so in order to make it fit just right, the next size up might work better but the length might be too long. It might just be that the shoe is a lot different than others.

For the first touch they look like a fragile piece of knit but in fact are really durable. They are very light, comfortable and have no firmer inner part that could cause blisters like Zoom Streak 4 does. You can run even w/o socks and still feel like on the velvet cloudlet. I have size 10,5 and ordered exact the same. I must say they are really TRUE TO SIZE.

526628,5,08/03/2012,"Great racing shoe Just got back from my first run in these shoes. Initial thoughts.

- in a strait line these shoes feel fantastic
- on a sloped road or sharp turns they feel a bit like you are going to slide off them
- 1/2 size down on the upper was a good choice. No discernable rubbing even though the upper is snug on my foot
- firmer than the Lunaracer, but not as firm as the Adios
- the midfoot is bouncy, feeling like good energy return
- the forefoot is closer to the ground than I thought, but still not punishing to the feet
- there is no lock down last lace hole for those that like to lock your heal in
- not a minimalist shoe--I don't know the heal rise, but it is more than the Lunaracer+--I would guess 9-11mm.
- they do have a slight cutout on the lateral side of the heal to reduce heal strike (like the Adios)
- felt decent with no break in. I could have raced today in them.
- ventilation was as good as expected

Overall a very nice, very, very light shoe with a fantastic upper. The only down side is there is not much if any stability. I would be leary of using them in a race with a lot of turns or on a highly slanted road. I will race these in my upcoming half marathon, and look forward to it. Comfort was fantastic.",33708752

However, the shoe provides sufficient cushioning against hard road surfaces, the feel of which actually ""softens"" after the first couple of miles. The uppers are remarkably insubstantial. I did not experience blisters or lost toenails, even after multiple high mileage runs. I train in Florida, so I have special appreciation for the maximum ventilation provided by the new knit technology. The shoes look great -- my running buddies all went to the web site to buy a pair, but they appear to be sold out across the country. I view the Flyknit as the best new Nike technology since the Lunar Racer. It actually differentiates itself in feel, comfort and performance.",33705217
526628,5,08/02/2012,"Best new nike technology Shoes is amazingly light and comfortable. Looking forward to the new color releases in the future, would highly recommend for running and casual wear. True to size, don't 1/2 size down.",33701634
526628,1,08/01/2012,Worst Shoe Ever The shoe got ruined on my first run and the lace loop broke. If you fall onto the heal of the shoe the heal gets compacted and you will constantly be tripping due to the fact that there is a half inch missing from around the sole perimeter due to less weight. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!,33677385
526628,5,07/30/2012,"FlyKnit Racer Wow,
As a true racing shoe this is something different!
a one piece upper is great, but really look at the details of the upper. It's just amazing how they create something like that.

Make sure to try them on though as the shoe/upper runs rather large. I went half a size down, but could probably go down a full size!

Other than that, they feel very comfortable. Like a sock really. Mid/outsole is soft and flexible enough, but certainly not too soft. Firmer than the LunaRacer, but a bit more softer/springy than the Zoom Streak.",33607920
526628,5,07/30/2012,"Light weight Love this shoe.Very light weight and great traction, I use it for running up tails, Fits like a glove to your foot and strongly recommend it. Oh and looks really good too.",33595761
818676,5,09/04/2017,"Elite Performance I've ran about 88 km in these shoes over the last couple of months and can definitively say they are an excellent pair of running or casual wear sneakers. The lightweight Flyknit upper is a breathable and durable one piece for great comfort while on feet. It wont cut your ankle if you wear appropriate socks (duh, common sense). The Flywire brio cables give you that ""locked in"" feel while still remaining snug and soft. The Dynamic fit collar is not for every one but I love how it flows from shoe to calf so fluidly.

Lunar foam is spongy and responsive on pavement/ concrete while it makes you feel like you are gliding on a cloud, I do however wish they added some rubber pads to the sole for extra durability. I recommend staying away from quick lateral movements or cuts while wearing these as they are more straight line /distance running than ""gym training"".

Overall great pair of running shoes which is why I own two pairs (one for running, the other for casual wear). I enjoy wearing them every time I slip them on my feet and cant recommend them enough!",169751419

They had received good reviews and the individual within the store stated it was a top of the line running shoe. When wearing these beware of the seam in the back of the shoe, only running 3 miles and I felt pain. The placement has a ridge in the rear inside of the shoe which caused me to have a painful blister. I wish I could've seen a review about this prior to purchase. Now I am outside of my 30 day return window and want to warn you to stay away from this line. First pair of Nikes that have actually done more harm than good.",169307330
818676,5,08/06/2017,"Great Shoe The upper ankle support is good, and at first felt stiff, but got more comfortable as I ran. The heel is soft and is good support. The laces are tight and the shoe is very durable and resistant to dirt and wet grass, sand. I do distance running, on dirt, sand, mud, aspalt,  concerete , and on is VERY GRIPPY. ands great for long periods of time, feet dont get hot inside the shoe. Though occasionally it can be annoying that rocks and Peebles will get stuck the grooves of the shoes bottom, not a deal breaker, just annoying. I put very high mileage on my shoes and am very picky about which shoes I run in, because previously shoes have given me injuries in the midfoot multiple times, and the lunar series of shoes seemed to a good solution, and this one is my favorite by far. I had a pair of addidas boosts, and I like these more for running, will be getting a new pair of these in a few months,  if another updated model doesnt come out.",168042613
818676,5,08/01/2017,"IF you are smart, buy these. These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have worn in my entire life. I decided to put the 6mm insoles in them and they are even better! The flyknit and sock just come around your foot and you feel like you have great support. I play basketball a lot and if I play some pick-up ball and these are the only things I have, I can still play easily. Overall, great shoe. Don't look at the negative reviews, they probably got a bad pair or don't take care of shoes very well",167724549

Also, another reason why I like the shoe is that you can where it with almost anything on, I have a lot of running shoes but they dont look good if I where one of my neon shoes or my dirty running shoes. Overall great purchase and Im very glad I own this shoe.",161894835

I actually feel as though they helped with my running, yes it perhaps is psychological, but all the R&D that went into these feels as though it's worked. I have 2 pairs now and I must say, I want another. It's the classic lunarlon sole, with a new tighter fitting top half and they feel like socks, they're really comfortable. I went for half a size smaller, as they're for running, but if you want comfort for day to day, go for half a size bigger as it suggests. Don't second guess, just buy a set and try for yourself.",161839898

818676,1,05/09/2017,"Flywire ripped These shoes are incredibly comfortably and look great. However, after only about a month of use the flyknit holding the laces has broken meaning they cannot be used. This is very frustrating as they have had very little use at all.",160873612

818676,5,04/22/2017,"Best Running Shoe Ever I have owned 2 pairs of Nike Running shoes within the past year, one being the Nike Free Run Distance and the other being the Nike Air Zoom Structure 18. Both achieved different goals of mine which I was happy to acheive, but I felt like I wanted something a little different. While the shoe has a very odd look that others would find strange, it is a slight detail that should easily be overlooked when coming to terms with comfort and fit. The fit is great, as I would recommend ordering your regular size. The dynamic fit collar and Flyknit conform to your foot to give you the perfect fit, as it only feels like a sock. The only downside is that sharp turns can be a bit of a challenge, as my foot would slip when taking such turns. While Nike had shoes defined as run fast, run fast, and run long, I believe this shoe was the perfect in-between for each section, though It can be difficult to go at paces faster than 6:00/Mile. I currently have 224 miles on them and they still feel fantastic and I still use them. I enjoyed this shoe so much I actually purchased the shield version of this shoe and the second generation which was given to me by Nike for free (thank you Nike btw, though I don't know what I did to earn, though another free pair would be nice *hint hint*). Overall, I look forward to future generations of this shoe and would highly recommend to anyone looking for good distance shoe with exceptional durability, fit, and performance.",159295341

I have used to run in Nike Frees, but this one takes running to a whole new level. The shoe is really comfortable to wear as well. Therefore, I use this quite often. If you have wider feet, it is best to order a half size bigger shoe because the flyknit upper provides a quite significant amount of compression. I highly recommend this shoe to any casual runner.",152102822

818676,4,12/19/2016,"Great with one drawback The flyknit upper on these feels AMAZING. One seamless layer hugging your foot down to the sole without any folding. The lunarlon sole is also amazing to stand in all day or to run. 
The only problem I've had with them is that the collar is tight. I do not have thick legs but I also don't have chicken legs, with that being said I did feel pressure on and around my achilles. Little irritation did occur while wearing these for over 8 hours and it definitely is noticeable when sitting down in a driving position. 
All in all though, the shoe is very comfortable and the response from the lunarlon is amazing. If Nike could fix the collar and make it like their soccer cleats it would be perfect.",139873779

After a few runs, the shoe feels as if it was specifically designed for my foot. I personally found this shoe to be very true to size. At first, the shoe seemed slightly large, not large enough to make a drastic difference, but large enough to notice. Like I had mentioned before, after a few runs, the shoe now feels like it was custom made to fit my foot. It is absolutely flawless. On top of all of the other flawless features of this amazing shoe, it is by far one of the most supportive Nike running shoes I have ever purchased.

818676,4,10/10/2016,"Great but not perfect After 500+ km I think I can say I know these shoes. So here is a short list of pros and cons regarding Lunarepics.

Pros
- Ultra soft. I always had issues with my knees. With these shoes the pain has almost disappeared. They're still very very soft.
- The material for the upper part of the shoe is superb. Soft and light yet very durable. Your feet will feel super comfortable in there.
- The sock-like part of the shoe is great. During running it feels natural and it helps a bit to gain stability. No issues for me.
- Equally good for short and somewhat longer runs. I have run more than 100 times and up to 10 km with them and they perform superbly every single time.
- Beautiful. These shoes are gorgeous!

Cons
- Pebbles! After every run I need to remove all those tiny little rocks my shoe has collected. This is counter-revolutionary, Nike!
- Lunarepics are for running and only running. Avoid any other kind of activity with them, they will wear out very soon. 
- The price tag. These shoes are ridiculously expensive.",130171623
818676,3,10/07/2016,"Comfortable, but Not the best for either fast or urban running I really wanted to love this shoe. Especially because I love Nike, love Flyknit, and, unlike most, actually like the midrise upper as I currently weight train in the Free Train Force Flyknit. So I wanted to see what all the hype was about when they released the Lunar Epic. I'm currently training for Ironman 2017 so I was looking for something that I can rack up some miles in while also working on my high-mileage speed. Here are my thoughts:

- The shoe is without a doubt one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever ran in. I cross train in 11.5, but I got a 12 which fit great as the 11.5 was kind of snug and what everyone tells me, is to go 1/2 size up for distance running. It was like a plush booty on my foot.

- I run through downtown chicago, stopping at lights, dodging cars coming out of gas stations and alleys, avoiding people on running paths and sidewalks, and this is where the shoe disappointed me. Even the slightest lateral adjustment proved troublesome, slow, and unresponsive / shifty. I wouldn't take these on a track.

-Although soft and comfortable, i felt it was too soft and inefficient, especially when picking up tempo at speeds 5k pace or greater. 

-I bought these shoes along with the Pegasus 33 Shields, and these shoes (Lunar Epics) brought on greater fatigue in my legs and felt like i had to work a bit harder to create energy lost in the softness of my step.

Overall, I think these shoes are great if you're just looking to get a comfortable, luxurious, decent paced leisure run as part of an aerobic workout.. and on an open road or pathway. But if you're looking for more responsiveness and speed, look elsewhere. I'll be returning these and keeping the Peg 33s!

sidenote: I've always been more likely to lean towards the side of minimalist shoes such as the frees (last one i wore was the free flyknit 3.0) and once I started longer races I switched to the flyknit lunar series (which I think got discontinued with the 3?) until I ran holes in them. So I was looking for my next distance shoe.",129848662
818676,5,09/29/2016,"Great shoe Cushioning is amazing. It's very comfortable with high impact absorption. Love the option of changing the insole. I use the 4mm cushion for fast runs and the 6mm for long distance.

The shoe is very light.

No heel issues.",129244966

One of Nike's best for years and a future classic...

I have 3 pairs - Red, Citrus Yellow and Emerald Green. I'd have more but My only criticism is - Why oh why in NIKEID they all have a black collar...? (OK if the shoes is black) It spoils the whole aesthetic and beauty of the shoe - which should be all one colour... If not for this - I would of had purchased more pairs... It ruined the 'Unlimited' version where the women's version worked well... (all the women's colours are good) If there was mens sizes I definitely would of purchased them... It's the 21st Century, I think it's time to stop gender specific colours - A colour should just be a colour regardless of gender... LOVE THE SHOE",129139621
818676,5,09/27/2016,"Weird Experience, Great Shoe When I took these shoes out of the box, I didn't understand them. I bought them along with a pair of the Free RN Flyknits when the price on these went down, and decided to return the pair I liked less. The experience of putting one of these on, with the one-piece, flyknit upper and no tongue was incredibly unfamiliar at first. I was a devotee of the Free series for a long time, so this was a new experience.

I went on runs of about five miles in each shoe, and in the Lunarepics I felt like I could have run forever. The cushion is incredible and my knees, shins, ankles, and hips, all feel a lot less impact when I run in them. They are indeed the shoe I decided to keep, and would recommend them to anyone. 

My one caution with the shoe is that the cuff can be uncomfortable during casual wearing or walking. I don't notice it when I run, but the cuff on the left shoe sometimes rubs against my ankle. Wearing thick socks seems to remedy this, which is why I suggest going true to size with these shoes.",129031768
818676,5,09/24/2016,"Nike's Best Shoe I'm in love with this shoe.


I've been running competitively since high school, and I've run through scores of shoes in that time. On average, I log about 45 miles a week, mostly fast mileage (less than 7min/mile). I've never once stepped into a shoe and noticed a huge difference in comfort, and I didn't initially when I put on the Lunarepics. Only when I felt like wearing another shoe (my Lunarglide 7s) did I notice how profoundly comfortable the Lunarepics are. They blow everything Nike has ever made out of the water. Running in them is like floating over the ground, it's effortless. The elastic upper makes the shoe feel like it's attached to my leg rather hugging my foot, as if the shoe is the natural extension of my ankle. The shoe has great midsole cushion and support.


I have the yellow ones, and the only problem I can think of to mention here is that the blue inner sleeve bleeds through the yellow material, turning the shoe green in places where my foot contacts the flyknit material. Also, Nike will almost certainly ruin these with the next iteration (like they did with the Lunar1s) so get them while they're still here!",128653029

Went running in these and good lord I had to stop because the shoe was that painful. The area in the inside of the shoe where your you Achilles tendon is, toward the lower end, it rubs right against it causing a sharp, nagging pain every single step.

I had this problem specifically in the right shoe. Even when just simply walking the rubbing from the inside of the shoe against my achilies tendon was very painful. I gave them another shot, still horrible. I will never wear these shoes again, considering a shoe should be comfortable and not cause pain. 

I hope I can return them even though the outsole is already fairly dirty for using them for just two days.",125900175

This semester I am actually taking time away (not really) from fall track and studying abroad in Scotland. I figured with the trip (and how bad my other shoes smell) I would pick up a new shoe for longer distance running. I went with the LunarEpic flyknit on kind of a random suggestion from a teammate and I couldn't be more happy.

Sole is good for running and upper just snuggles around your foot and give you a fit and comfortable feel. I over pronate while running and this sole is perfect as it provides lot of cushioning. I had my doubts earlier with the high ankle support but this in turn stabilizes your foot while running/walking. I have used the product to run on treadmill, run/walk on road and ground.

While in Portland for work in April I visited Nike store and saw these bada$$ shoes in green and royal blue. I was inspired to move just looking at them. They felt a little weird when I first tried them on, mainly because I never wore anything like them. That would not deter me, I had to have them.

I walked in them for about a week to break them in, and have been running in them ever since. They are extremely comfortable, and I never touch the laces. They slip on and off with ease and feel great.

The sock/sleeve adds support but is not tight or uncomfortable, and I have had no blisters or scraping when using them.

818676,5,06/29/2016,I Was A Little Skeptic I bought these kinda skeptical about them because everyone was loving them. I bought them and the moment I put them on I was in love. They are insanely comfortable and the sock makes everything feel seamless. I love these! One thing is because of the pattern of the sole little pebbles tend to get stuck. Other than that these are by far my favorite pair of running shoes to date. I had to buy another pair just so I could have a pair for a daily basis! If you're on edge because of the price they are worth every penny! I enjoy these and plan on sticking with these for as long as possible! In the end I highly recommend these!,116070004
818676,2,06/29/2016,"Just Scrap it! The scrapping/pinching of the Achilles heel is real! The shoe is super comfortable at first, but after a couple hours of wear the pinching on the heel starts to be real annoying. I got blisters & scabs from wearing them too often. This shoe is good for a quick casual errand or two, would not recommend for actual running or exercise. Do not wear multiple days in a row either, the blisters and the skin gets more and more irritated. I wore these with those nice Dri-Fit Nike socks too, no benefit. A real shame since I was super hype about these when they came out. A real bust! :(",116057794
818676,3,06/29/2016,"Amazingly comfortable........BUT I must admit i feel a little odd complaining about the Lunarepics, because of a couple of reasons:
1) they are actually really comfortable. I like the snugness of the collar (although it does take a little time to get used to) and
2) they actually look pretty nice on feet, with people often looking down at my feet when i am wearing them - im guessing the collar catches the eye as i have the plain old black colourway :)

BUT

I feel like i have to comment on the silly selection of sole/grip you guys have used. Firstly, they are noisy, just walking along you sound like you are walking on a freshly cleaned floor (squeak, squeak) no sneaking up on anyone lol. That i could most likely live with, except for that is not the only issue with the sole for me. 

I wore them to the office (as its summer and i wanted to show them off a little) and on the way, i actually noticed that these things are like a vacuum for all stones and rocks. I could actually feel some of them as i was walking. The grip is basically comprised of thin circles of foam-like material, it is rather flimsy, so when one stone gets stuck, it sort of pries open that circular section and then more and more get caught in. 

So when i got to my office i had to get a paperclip, and fish dozens and dozens of stones out - keep in mind this was just walking to work. 

Then i took them running......of which the grips were literally filled with stones. 

This is a massive issue for me, because i am fortunate enough to live near a beautiful forest of which i run on a sandy/compressed gravel path/road. I understand that accumulation of stones and rocks is somewhat normal perhaps - but i have had airmax running shoes before and have never had one stone at all - and ofcourse that means the comfort is never compromised. 

I took them to the running track to wear them - so they dont collect stones - and they performed well, but they were a little slippery there. 

It is also pretty slippery when there is water or overnight rain

So in short - i love the shoe - but maybe only as a casual shoe because of the grip. I feel like it lets down an otherwise really good shoe. This is a letdown mainly due to the price point, i could have bought a Jordan to wear casually at this price. 

So what is the better running shoe? Flyknit Racer? Its light, but does it offer the same cushioning? There is the Air Max which have loads of cushioning, but they are rigid and heavier.....

Sorry to complain about something like this, but for me it was a big deal.",116032894

Honestly so disappointing and would recommend avoiding at all costs. I would highly recommend the flyknit lunar 3 anyway.",115681899
818676,4,06/25/2016,"Good running shoe Good running shoe, very comfortable and light. My first run in these was 9 miles all concrete. Shoes felt great, zero pain or soreness in my knees, ankles, or feet. Felt like I was running on turf/crass. Sole is really thick so they are slightly slower. I switch to a lower profile shoe for more speed. The only cons are the shoes are warm, because of the construction material. The foam soles declined after about 60 miles which is fairly typical of foam shoes. The shoes are still good but I can definitely tell the difference. I think the shoes are a great casual wear shoe, very cool looking and stylish. For purely running, if the shoe was $50 cheaper, I would give them 5 stars and order more pairs. However, there are lots of products just as good for much cheaper.",115628031

So I am a bit desapointed with the heel chafing, there is something wrong there that ruins na otherwise fantastic shoe.",113042652
818676,4,05/30/2016,"Very comfortable and surprisingly supportive I was slightly dubious having seen a few reviews that state the heel would rub and cause pain. I have to say, I haven't seen any issues, having done runs up to 6 miles a go. However, I do run with various brands of running socks and wouldn't run sock free. 

Very very comfortable, the shoe disappears once you've got you feet in and done 0.5 a mile.

These shoes also look good. I am hoping they are durable, but it's too early to comment.

Downsides? Well, the laser 'topographical cut outs' do accumulate small stones and dirt which do require removal occasionally. Also, the shoe, whilst comfortable, doesn't provide high stability control, so if that's a feature you need they these might not be for you.

In summary, a very comfortable, stylish and very different shoe from the norm. Happy with my purchase.",112995132

The employee at Nike gave me a half size down because he said they run big. Ive been wearing them for about 4.5 hours now and the elastic that goes around my ankle on the left shoe is really digging into my skin. The rest of the shoe feels great but Im worried that part is going to really irritate my skin. I really want to like these but Ill probably have to exchange them for the Free RN Flyknit.,112458717
818676,2,05/25/2016,Shoes has great potential but a little disappointed I bought the hyper orange and wore the same size as my other running shoes. Slipping on these shoes is very easy and fast and they feel very comfortable when you first put them on. I was happy with just wearing them and walking around. Upon taking it on a run the shoes was a bit uncomfortable to run with when there has been tiny of pebbles stuck on the bottom. Not only that I got blister on the back of my foot which was uncomfortable even when I was wearing nike elite socks which are suppose to have good padding. I wish there was more padding on the back as well as the bottom for more comfort. The design of the shoes is really nice and everything I wish they would improve the bottom of the shoes as well so little tiny rocks wont stick under it causing discomfort.,112324059

I've only done 2 five mile runs in these so far but I'm impressed by the comfort and the feel of the foot strike in these shoes. I've had foot injuries in the past and based on this I typically do a cushioned shoe like the Vomero but wanted to try something different this time. I'm glad I did! I finish my runs and feel like I could keep going, the shoes are that comfortable. I haven't noticed any of the scraping on the heel I read previously. I however don't tighten the laces, I feel that if you buy your usual size the shoe slips on like a sock and you forget it's there. No need to pull and tighten the laces, not for me anyhow. I say get past the sticker shock and get a pair. You'll be glad you did!!",112315065

The upper completely disappears on your foot while running, and leaves you feeling like your are just running on a soft yet responsive surface. I can't say enough about how comfortable this shoe is, it just slides right on, never having to retie the laces, like a boot. The flyknit breathes and moves with your foot like a glove, and somehow manages to have a snug fit without causing any hotspots or rubbing. I recently changed to this shoe for marathon distance, and as long as they make them, I'll continue to run in them. Maybe Nike could lower the heel toe drop from 10mm to 6 or 8, but that would be my only suggestion.",110980529

Also the feel of the show encouraged me to run with a better form and pace. Each stride feels very smooth. After the run I didnt want to take the shoes off. At first I was a little wary of the look of the shoe. Youll get over it quickly.  I was also worried about the issues people have had with their heels. I fortunately didnt have that issue.",110759901

Long runs feel much different as if the shoe is wearing you. Its something totally new that is going to catch on in the future. I love the shoe, still breaking them in, only about 20miles on them after a week but still, theyre holding up, heel clip is a little odd and uncomfortable but the shoe and sole feel great.

818676,5,05/03/2016,"Exceeds Expectation About three weeks into running with the new lunarepic flyknits. A few initial impressions: No issue at all with rubbing or blistering. I run with Balega Enduro quarter socks. They come up just above the top of the knit ankle. The shoe itself is as comfortable a running shoe as I have ever worn. It really is just about invisible to your feet and your stride. They are easy to slide on and off without any lacing or unlacing. I tie a somewhat loose double knot so that they do not come undone while running. i found they ran true to size. I also found that they became more comfortable about a mile or two into my first run. As I have run with Nike Vomeros for the last 10 years, I guess I should expect that.

I find that the sole of the lunarepic promotes a very neutral, upright stance that actually adds comfort to my run. Somehow, I find that it adds to a quicker cadence (confirmed by my Garmin 235 running watch) and thus a faster pace (I typically run 8:15 to 8:30 and am now running a full 15 seconds faster). Also, I am running easier. I assume this is due to my posture, not the shoe itself - though the shoe promotes the posture. Again, according to the watch my heart rate is staying in zones 3 and 4 longer than a slightly slower pace with my Vomeros where I would be more in zones 4 and 5 (over 80% of max). Faster and more comfortable/fresh doesn't suck!

The shoes are very responsive. If start digging I feel it in my toes. If I fall back to my old bad habit of an exaggerated heel strike, I feel that too. A more upright, neutral posture over the balls of my feet feels great. And while I do get great road feel from the shoes, like a performance tire on a sports car, the ride is actually very soft and cushioned. I have never run in this much comfort. Can't recommend strongly enough! 

Small quirk - I can attest to the small pebbles becoming logged in the striations of the sole. I spend a few minutes after each run removing them by hand. Worth the hassle, in my opinion.",109518786
818676,5,04/26/2016,"Why Walk? Why should you walk when you can run in these bad boys? LunarEpic Flyknits are tops when it comes to running shoes, and just overall comfort.

If you aren't sure about what size to get, I'd go true to size since the Flyknit stretches a little. Overall, it's a very good shoe that is comfortable, light, and just plain old fun to run in.

I did some research on the Lunarlon tech and the reviews convinced me to buy the shoe.Ive had the shoes for less than a month and I love them. I was a little wary about the sock-like thingy at the top of the shoes but its one of those out of the box ideas that works. It can pinch the heel at times (brings back memories of bad fitting church shoes) but I think it has to do with straightening the sock more than anything. The shoes hug my feet and the Lunarlon sole does what it is supposed to: cushion. Im not much of a runner/jogger; Im more over a sprinter and when I get moving, I dont knee or Achilles pain (shins still hurt but meh).

I ran about 4 miles on without an incline and about 3 miles at a 10% incline... The shoes were great in both situations. The ankle cuff does make a difference. My previous go-to running shoe were my Flyknit Chukkas but these are far superior in my opinion.,106867153
818676,3,04/09/2016,Fits really snug The problem I had with the shoe is that the first flywire at the base of the tongue really dug into my food on the medial side of my foot. The length of the shoe was perfect but the width was again tight. And as for the fly knit I was expecting something stretchy and flexible. The only part that I found that was like that was the collar. While the rest of the shoe was flexible it felt like it had some plastic fused on there or something that gave it stiffness especially in the toe. The collar also pulled my crew socks down,106861052

818676,3,04/06/2016,"Somewhere between a Free and a Pegasus. So this shoes has a lot of good characteristics and a lot of bad.

Right out of the box I took these for a 6 mile run. I was not impressed. For about a year now I've been running in the Terra Kigers which are a trail shoe but retrospectively were a far superior all around shoe than these. 

The six miles were pretty bad compared to a run in the Terra Kigers although these are extremely light they aren't very stable and don't offer a the best arch support and they don't grasp my feet as well as I would suspect for something with this flynit technology.

As far as cushioning goes yes they are somewhat comfortable but its hard to overlook the instability and enjoy the comfort. I think these would be fine if you are running anything under 3 miles at a time which is contrary to the ""run forever"" motto of these shoes. This is why it falls in a range Somewhere between a Free and a Pegasus isn't quite as unstable as a free but isn't as stable as a Pegasus which for the distance I plan on running makes me think I should have just bought the Pegasus

Another fault I found was that they weren't very breathable even without wearing socks. maybe it's because I got a black pair maybe not but My feet were feeling the heat more than previous running shoes. Part of the mantra of this shoe is to make it appear as though you don't need to wear socks while wearing these however over the course of my initial run I found they created a blister on the ball of my foot and irritated the back of my heal which for distance is unforgivable hopefully this can be combated with socks but we will see.

These are pretty narrow too I think for anyone with a wider foot the arch support and narrowness would be extremely uncomfortable. I have narrow feet and so these work for most of my everyday needs however running or extensive standing might not be the best Idea.

On to the good though.

Stylistically these are beautiful. i love the sock like fit they go perfect with joggers and look decent even with shorts which would usually deter me from a mid height shoe. These shoes look sleek and slender and look sporty. I love the laser cut edges at first I wasn't all too impressed with them and thought it was just a bragging point for the shoe but these lines are flawless and a piece of art like the lines of a sports car. They compress and expand well. Aesthetically these shoes have it all going on. The heal has a beautiful roundness to it that i will continue to appreciate. the laces blend seamlessly into the fly-nit and overall the look is phenomenal. 

Overall the performance aspect of these was sacrificed for the aesthetic much like the frees of the past which make me wish that it would have been marketed as a training shoe as oppose to a running shoes especially with the ""run forever"" motto.",106628048

I would suggest ordering a half size larger for anyone with wider feet (i prefer my shoes to be as comfortably tight as possible and the shoes are just that). Ive gotten a few runs in these shoes. I mostly run on hilly concrete. I was surprised at how stable this shoes is. I thought that it might be easy to roll an ankle given at how thick the sole is, but this is not the case. It provides a generous amount of cushion while maintaining stability. The shoe it lightweight as well which is an important feature to me. 

Overall, i would say that this shoe is light, stable, and responsive, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone. I plan to buy another pair very soon!

818676,5,03/31/2016,"Best cushioned nike shoe since the airmaxes Traction: the outsole is pretty thin especially in high wear areas so don't beat this up too much but as long as your running straight and not dragging the shoe on a rough surface you should be fine. Other than that I love the way it moves you can feel the individual grooves in the toe areas flex and move when you run it feels great. 

Cushion: the cushion is awesome. Having the lunar molded with the outsole and uppers with heat rather than glue made a huge difference. You can feel the lunar in every stride. 

Flyknit: I personally like the ankle collar I don't think there is a huge performance benefit to it but if your one of those guys who likes feeling secure and something wrapped around your ankle you will like these. It doesn't pinch like the old flyknit 3.0's these fit great.",106199736

For the first time ever in a race I didn't worry about what was on my feet, so comfortable, even when wet through. Traction was very good.

These are by far the best pair of running shoes I own from Nike. Super comfortable, responsive and very light. THANK YOU Nike for moving the needle on product innovation. Cant wait for what is next! Just Do It Baby!!!",105843225
818676,5,03/24/2016,8 grade student I wear the shoes to school and everywhere. The shoes are very comfortable and durable. I play soccer in them football in them. Very nice product. I love these shoes.,105680288
818676,2,03/24/2016,"Great look, but major design flaw I wanted these as soon as I saw the all black ones. They looked like ninja shoes. While some people don't like the collar, I really like it. I've had the Footscape Magista and those are awesome. Where this shoe goes wrong is at the heel - where the sock material starts. The heel contours inwards and the vertical seam you see makes it a hard point pressing into your heel (just at the point where the second skin meets the sock material). Looking at other reviews, I'm not the only one with this issue. I have this problem only on the left foot. All I did was walk in them and they were super uncomfortable - to the point where I had to stop and walk barefoot. It's like having a small stone stuck in your sock and push against your Achilles tendon. My feet even hurt the next day just standing. I really like these shoes and the out-sole. I even tried shoving pieces if cardboard into the heel but that was only a temporary fix. I believe a small change to the design would make these perfect. The Magista's heel is full leather so something like that would help. I'll be returning these but I look forward to the low versions because the out-sole is really good.",105659378
818676,5,03/24/2016,Like Butter These shoes are so smooth and comfortable. It's like running on clouds. I feel like I can run for dayyyys with these on. Highly recommend.,105656998
818676,2,03/24/2016,"Great idea from Nike but poor execution. I really looked forward to getting this shoe. Throwing it on and heading to the track for a run immediately after getting the shoe. Intiial thoughts were the shoe looked funny but I cared more about comfort. The padding is incredibly. You get a responsive bounce which is great for me because I am a heavy runner. 61 , 220 LBs. The fit is really amazing. I already knew from previous Nike running shoes to get a half size up and it felt just perfect fly snug. However, after just driving for 15 min to the track I noticed I had a pain on my Achilles right above the heel. I would compare it to the pain you get wearing new dress shoes. I sucked it up and ran 2 miles and couldnt take the pain anymore. The part of the shoe were the heel clip ends and sock begins really cute into your Achilles and rubs to the point I started bleeding. Couldnt wait to take the sneakers off. Im going to give it another shot and see if it loosens up a bit. Btw, I was wearing crew socks which should have helped but really didnt. I love the sneakers fit but that help clip is a real design flaw in my opinion.",105652458
818676,5,03/24/2016,"Amazing Best running shoes I've ever had. Go ahead and try em out, you won't regret it.",105634578
818676,5,03/23/2016,"New Lunarepic Flyknit's are awesome! Just received yesterday (free shipping) the new Nike Lunarepic Flyknit's in ""Black/Photo Blue/Poison Green/Black"" (love the look). I took them right out of the box today, placed some thin Nike Running socks on feet, and ran 6 miles pounding the sidewalks of Buckhead. The shoes feel great and are very comfortable and have solid cushion (you get two liners; I used the thicker one). I recommend a 1/2 size up (I used to always wear a 10 1/2 but with all the flyknit's I seem to always need an 11). My feet are wide so the 1/2 size up seems to compensate. So yes I highly recommend these shoes if you do have to run on hard surface (which is the only option you have in the city unless you run on treadmill - which I do as well). Only time will tell as to how durable they are with the heat and constant pounding on hard surface. Awesome Nike! I will definitely be buying more in the other colors!",105551797
818676,5,03/21/2016,Awesome Running Shoe I'll be honest. I strongly dislike running other than for soccer. But these shoes made my run more enjoyable. Lot of cushion in the ball and sole of the foot during contact with the road,105426135
818676,5,03/21/2016,"Amazing As soon as these shoes were released I baught two pair, the red ones and the black ones. After wearing both I immediately noticed the black ones fit tighter then the red ones(both a size 10)...just so you guys know when you order! BUT I love these shoes they look great and they feel great with their very light design. I do agree that the ankle part irritates your ankle but that was after me wearing them ALL day and while wearing no show socks, got some ankle socks and they are even more comfortable with no irritation.I truthfully thought these shoes werent gonna be that durable especially when I wore them while playing racquet ball. For those of you whove seen people play racquet ball youre planting and accelerating a lot which puts a lot of pressure on your shoe, I play racquetball everyday for at least 2 hours among with my other cardio and weightlifting and my shoes still look brand new!! When I wear my red ones I swear everyone who walks past me stairs at my shoes! I definitely recommend",105405563
818676,1,03/21/2016,"Sore Heel After 5 Miles I purchased these shoes in preparation for my first 1/2 marathon. I am extremely glad there is a 30 day return policy, because my left heel was rubbed raw after 7 miles of running in these. The Lunarepics were extremely comfortable for the first few miles, but my heel was blistered after hitting 5 miles. I swapped out the insoles and tried the second pair that was included with the same disappointing result. I am very disappointed these shoes did not work for me as I love the design and initial comfort. I am returning them after one week and will look for another Nike running shoe that is easier on my heel.",105399957
818676,5,03/20/2016,"Easy on The Toes I find the toe box to be ideal, the way the upper is constructed makes for a really comfortable fit. I moved from Hoka's and have found these to be as comfortable. Although I haven't run over an hour yet. The upper and the larger toe box is more comfortable for me than the Hoka.

Where I live running on trails is impossible. So my experience so far is asphalt and concrete.",105316553
818676,1,03/20/2016,"Fashion over function These shoes look great but, as several others have already said, there is a major design flaw with the heel. The back of the shoe where the heel counter meets the the built-n sock rubs against your heel making it painful to run and causes blisters. I tried everything I could think of to make these work from different types of socks to padding the heel with bandages but ultimately I couldn't make them comfortable and had to return after less than five miles of wear.",105282680
818676,4,03/18/2016,"Achilles heels are in pain Its a very great shoe, love the lunar outsole and the flyknit. But my achilles heel are in pain after a few run or walks. I have changed to all kinds of socks but nothing has changed. It is really bothering me. Suggest those who want to buy them, try them on for a longer time.",105201150
818676,5,03/16/2016,EMOTIONAL PRODUCT I never write any reviews but I personally had to for these kicks. I have never purchased such a product that motivated me to exercise. Get a half size up and just go run!!,105040195
818676,5,03/16/2016,"AMAZING! My go-to shoe is the Flyknit Racer for short and long runs, but after running in the LunarEpic, we now have competition. 

I was hesitant on going up a half size, but I would say go with the same size you wear with the Lunaracer3+ , unless you choose not to wear socks. 

Going up a half size easily allows you to wear either sockliners and gives you more options on thin or thick socks. 

Right out of the box, I ran 5 miles with complete ease, comfort and finally understand what it's like to float. 

Highly recommend!",104984817
818676,5,03/14/2016,"WOW! I feel i can walk forever with these shoes!
i never felt so comfortable walking until i use these shoes. the best Running shoes i ever used. I bought 9.5 and 10 (just to be sure which to keep it) ( i'm usually 9.5 ) then decided to keep the size 10 to have a more comfortable sneaker as i don't compete. A must to have for every sneaker head who love to walk or run in a hyper comfortable sneaker! ( it's gorgeous as well ) by the way, bought 4 colors!",104914582
818676,5,03/14/2016,"SUPER SHOES FOR PEOPLE THAT HATE TO RUN I enjoy playing hoops, cycling, weight lifting, ect... but dislike sit ups and running. These two things are a necessary evil in order to perform decent when playing sports. I tried these shoes on and was superbly impressed. I've tried other Lunar based shoes, but It wasn't my thing. I prefer a zoom or air max based sneaker. There's always foot fatigue after first 10 minutes, but after trying them out of treadmill for 1 mile I didn't feel anything other than my legs starting to tire. Any shoe that can break past the first barrier of discomfort, and to me it's foot fatigue, then they are the shoes I want to keep in my exercise rotation. Cushion great; fit is great. However, there is irritation in the left Achilles. The fused heel counter probably doesn't fit my left foot and it's slightly irritable right now. My right foot feels like a one-to-one fit, but the left isn't quite perfect like I wanted. I hope the next series of these shoes it will address it OR maybe I got an odd pair. I may go try out other pairs to compare later when I have time. Thumbs up on these!",104864881
818676,5,03/13/2016,"Amazing shoes I usually dont write reviews, but after reading some inaccurate reviews of this shoe I thought I need to clear some stuff up. I run about 50-60 miles a week for track, before I got these shoes I ran in brooks cascadia 9s. As soon as put this shoe on I noticed it was very comfortable. They are slightly less stiff than brooks, but if you are a fairly strong runner that shouldnt be a problem. The shoes put a really nice even pressure all along the foot, and the flyknit around the ankle keeps the heel down really well, so I didnt feel the need for laces (you can remove them or just tie them loose). My first run in these was a 60min 8 mile road run and my feet and body felt good the whole time, but the slight decrease of stiffness from my brooks took some getting used to. I have been running in these for a week now and I still feel good. If I had one complaint it would be that rocks get stuck in the little cuts in the sole, my solution was to get one of those things that push back the cuticles on your nails and slide it through the cracks to get the dirt/rocks out (any thin piece of metal would work for this)To sum up these shoes are fantastic and I already ordered another pair that Im going to keep clean for track workouts!",104822782
818676,5,03/13/2016,LunarEpic When first seeing the shoe I wasnt feeling it. I tried them on and everything changed. If you love lunar you will undoubtedly love these. If you love flyknit you will love these. If you like the free 3.0 feel of the sock you will love these. Main difference is these are not hard to get on and the cushioning is top notch. Not sure how the laser siping effects the shoe. But seems like more of a cool design feature rather than performance but Im not sure and not a big runner. I got these for the gym and for casual wear. I walked out with two pairs and a new favorite training shoe. Before this shoe I was a big metcon trainer. These are not as stable but for everyday lifting and non oly lifts these will be perfect. I know theyre designed for running but theyre perfect for everything. My only negative is I wish the outsole came in black in s non Nike lab edition. I got the black and mints and the orange ones. Small negative and more of a personal choice than negative. These rock. You wont be dissapointed. Find them for less than 175 and you have yourself a steal!,104800281
818676,5,03/13/2016,"Just what I needed I was a little skeptical on the price tag, but glad I made the purchase, I love the hi-top feel in a running Shoe, just what I have been looking for! Great Bounce feeling with the new Lunarlon sole. Don't hesitate on these, buy now... besides when you have 30 days for a real test run by purchasing directly thru Nike!!!",104779292
818676,4,03/12/2016,"only one problem this is probably by far the best flyknit they have done. compared to other knitted upper options it isn't as soft but i do like it has a more durable feel to it while having a supportive yet flexible upper. like i said, this is the best flyknit they have ever done.

the grooves on the bottom of the shoe is absolute genius. if u thought the nike frees did a good job at making u feel like it was natural when u ran or walked. nike took it to the next level with this one. i could swear the midsole was moving to my exact movements. 

the lunarlon cushion is in between a firm lunarglide and a plush drop in midsole from a kobe shoe. when u walk it absorbed just the right amount of impact to give the right amount of soft cushion and still remain firm enough to be responsive. the return energy on it was a totally new feeling.

the part that absolutely ruined everything for me was the lockdown. possibly just half an inch higher or maybe even a quarter inch higher for the heel counter, i probably would have stayed locked in better. nope, after a few steps i can feel my heel rubbing the back of the shoe every step of the way. i tried different socks just to find any excuse to want to keep it but it just didn't work out for me. 

the material chosen for the midsole does make me wonder how long it will last from running outside though since it does feel so soft. i'm also curious about the flex grooves and how it will be like getting small rocks or pebbles stuck inside of them. i know i hated it when that happened in my free runs. i'll never know because i couldn't get past the lockdown of the shoe.",104772236
818676,5,03/12/2016,"Best Running Shoe Ever!! If you want to feel like running on clouds with no stress on your joints and muscles, Buy this shoe!!...Amazing comfort and shoe reacts to your every move.

818676,1,03/12/2016,"These shoes have a major design flaw The back of the compression collar impresses on the achilles, causing discomfort and marking. I experimented with cotton and dri fit synthetic socks of various heights and thickness and nothing alleviated the discomfort and irritation. A run in these shoes results in blisters on the heel and achilles. I would advise trying on the shoes before buying to see if the collar rubs on your achilles as it did for me. Even a few minutes of wear left red marks and impressions on my achilles and heel. The midsole has excellent cushioning but the outsole captures pebbles and debris and sounds like wet shower shoes when walking or running. Extremely disappointed.",104706292
818676,5,03/11/2016,Nothing Like it Oh myyyy were the exact words that came out my mouth as soon as I put my foot in the shoe. The first thing I noticed was the cushion I felt when I walked around the store. It was nothing like I had ever felt. It felt like I had stepped on gel almost. By far my favorite running shoe. The cushion is like a cross between the Air Max and the lunaron base. I hope thsee shoes come put again next year,104689966
818676,4,03/11/2016,"Great shoe, one problem..hopefully temporary I received my lunar epics yesterday. I took them out of the box and did a quick 8 miles, at about 7:30 per mile, which is fast for me. I LOVE the flyknit upper. It is so comfortable and still holds my foot in place. The midsole is quite cushy, but doesn't seem to slow me down like some other cushioned shoes do. I'm really impressed with these shoes, both performance and comfortwise. The only issue I had was at about about mile 6, I started to get some rubbing on the back around my achilles area, despite wearing socks a bit higher than the ankle sleeve. It seemed to be right about where the shoe joins the ankle sleeve. I'm hoping they'll break in and stop rubbing there. If not, despite all the great features, they'll have to go back.",104677851
818676,5,03/11/2016,"Epic indeed Very comfortable, the flyknit upper is very comfortable too. The higher part of the shoe didn't really bother me on my run, but you should probably wear them before your first run in them. Overall a great shoe the only problem is getting pebbles stuck in the sole.",104670866
818676,5,03/10/2016,Different and good Bought these when they first came out. Ran in them yesterday. They felt great in all aspects. Looking forward to running in them a lot.,104604551

818676,3,03/08/2016,Okay shoe I thought this shoe had great comfort and bounce in the sole similar to the Roshe sole. The flexibility maneuverability is good. The sock was a little uncomfortable. Plus the shoe was little more heavier compared to a show like the flyknit 4.0. I ran in the shoe for trail launch but wouldn't mind trying it for longer but not at the price now. Maybe when it hits clearance or outlets for less.,104435403

I assume they run slightly wide because my son loves them and the primary issue we have with shoes is how wide his foot is; but he loves these and refuses to wear any other sneaker.

I'm on my second pair and at about 75 miles, it's starting to happen again.

831413,5,05/22/2017,great racing shoe I agree with most of the comments on here in regards to this being a great light weight racing flat with enough cushioning that you can use up to marathon. Some reviewers are correct that the durability of the shoe is lacking though. I recommend using only for races and have a trainer ready for your workouts.,162123537
831413,3,05/16/2017,"A ""Zippy"" racing flat.....but beware I bought these with the view to use them for an upcoming Marathon, I've tried pretty much everything out there in the past! 

Out of the box these Streak 6's feel and look great, they are super light as you expect and the minimal upper makes for a snug fit. Walking around in them you can tell they will be fast! The 8mm heel drop is a little daunting as is the firmness so you do wonder how they will feel out on the road. However I was confident enough walking around the house to take them out for a run - the point of no return for a running shoe bought online!

The broader midfoot build to the sole and that strip of plastic certainly gives them some sort of ""Zip"" and after a few miles I thought these were going to serve me very well. 

However......

As more and more miles stacked up I soon wished for a little more cushioning, the ride in the Streak 6 is hard (and harsh?) and despite the zip from the sole and plastic insert you cannot get away with too much firmness for too long. FYI I am around 6ft 3ins and weigh 12st 10oz so I am on the larger side for a runner (Half PB is 1:18 and Mara PB 3:03 so I am used to running reasonable times in racing flats) but I have run marathons and longer races in other makes of shoe in this sort of range, albeit I have never found the perfect shoe for me. 

The fit is very good, snug but not too snug and just enough room for the toes, plus the upper allows your feet to remain cool, the heel part of the sole is a little slim though and as you run round corners you can feel your foot slipping around just a bit - I think this is where some of the comments here regarding durability may have merit.....you can tell exactly where these small tears in the upper will appear because as you corner your foot puts pressure on these points.

Nike have definitely hit on something with this sole, I tend to land on my midfoot to forefoot and the transition to toe off of the Streak 6's is one of the best I have come across, the extra midfoot ""bulge"" suits me well and there is definitely a spring feel to them, but as I said before the ride is incredibly firm given the thickness of the foam used and towards the end of a marathon this is only going to hurt your legs and time....well mine anyway.

If you are much lighter/smaller than I (circa 10-11st) and are used to running in flats then I would absolutely recommend trying them. If you are like me and look at the Elite runners and wonder ""could I ever wear the same shoes as them for a marathon"" then dont get these, upgrade to something more cushioned and your legs will thank you.

For me these will no doubt be my go to shoe for my next half marathon, but the hunt for the perfect marathon shoe continues (and my credit card feels the pain!)",161690252
831413,5,05/13/2017,"Great shoe! The Streak 6 is a great shoe, it runs a bit small so go at least half a size up. (I wear a 12 and it's ok but should be a bit larger). The shoe feels ultra light on your feet and straight out of the box I ran a half marathon in them. No problems what so ever. I can imagine that the upper (very thin mesh material) tears quickly so be sure to clip your toenails and wear socks. Overall a perfect race flat in my shoe-quiver",161498784

831413,1,04/26/2017,"Terrible Durability, won't last at all! This was my second pair of the Streak 6 because the first time I tried these on they felt amazing. Still the best flat I've ever worn, for about 50 miles only. The first time I thought it might have been a fluke and because they felt so great I pushed through to about 150 miles. 

This time it happened again! The upper tore on both shoes on the lateral side. The upper comes off the midsole with a gradual tear then there is a complete hole. 

I have and will continue to only run in Nike because of the performance. I use easy miles in the Pegasus models and have used a few different models of flats from Nike. Terribly disappointed in how little these last. I even tried the flyknit versions but they don't feel the same, plus much more expensive!

If you're interested in these shoes, maybe try the FlyKnit version. They are more expensive, but the upper seems much more durable.

831413,4,02/08/2017,"One update would make it a super speedster I've long struggled to find a racing shoe that fits my wider feet while providing enough stability and bounce. It seems most are made for narrow-footed runners who weigh about 10.5 stone. So when I tried the Streak 6 I was thrilled. The fit was wonderful and I genuinely thought I'd found the shoe that would lead to many PBs. Three months on from buying the shoe, I've used it in two 10Ks/5ks and PBd each time. However, echoing what other reviewers have said, the design flaw of having the perforated mesh on the medial side of the upper where it joins the sole has led to a tear appearing one shoe. Please fix this Nike and leave everything else unchanged and this will be one super speedster. (Note: I've been doing my interval runs in training using the Flyknit version to stop the risk of further tearing but it does have a slightly roomier fit which may suit some more than others, and obviously this is an extra cost). It's also worth noting that you need to size up half a size (I'm a 9.5 in most shoes, but a 10 in this).",150092394

The heel cup is angled so far forward that it digs into my achilles and causes pain. 3. The toe box is so tight vertically and the material is so fragile that after 110 miles I have holes in both big toes. Sadly, this is just as they've started to break-in.

843764,5,10/15/2016,"Very comfortable shoes I bought this for casual wearing. I dont think it provide good traction on running, but it's very comfortable to wear. Recommended.",131065351
843764,5,10/09/2016,The best This shoe is literally sooooooooo comfy. Very underrated in my opinion. The flyknit forms to your foot very fast so its not even tight. I have a wide foot and still felt this shoe very comfy. The way they used the lunar tech is just amazing. I dont use lunarlon for running but use it more for when I am working. The shoe gives you such a smooth ride from heel to toe. The only problem would be how the littlest things get inside the sole.,130018504
843764,5,10/04/2016,"Nike's Best Runner To Date Ever since the high top version of this shoe was first announced, I was excited to give these a try. I prefer running in low tops, just because I don't like feeling too constricted when I'm running. Prior to these, I primarily ran in the Flyknit Racer and had zero complaints about those, so my expectations were high for these. 

The difference is literally day and night. While the Racer's go for the minimalist approach to a running shoe, these cover all aspects of what I personally look for in a runner. They're light enough to barely notice that you have anything on your foot, yet the cushioning is so responsive that they weren't kidding when they said you could ""run forever"" The flyknit is soft and by no means stiff or rigid (the one ""issue"" I had with my Racers - never considered it an issue, just an observation) Yes rocks and other small objects do get stuck in the ridges on the sole of the shoe, but its nothing that a toothpick or one of my keys can't handle. When they're fresh out the box, they're very ""sticky"" to the ground, I'm guessing from the laser cut ridges in the sole, so never a worry about slipping on pavement.

They're great both for running, training, wearing to the gym or just casually. Overall, I think Nike hit the nail on the head with these in comfort, functionality and style, and I'm looking forward to more colorways and maybe even a winterized version (New York gets very cold in the winter months!)

PROS
Soft, responsive cushioning
Lightweight yet sturdy & durable
Great traction

CONS
None at the moment, but I don't foresee any in the future! Bravo Nike!",129637540
843764,5,09/27/2016,"Great lightweight distance shoe for on/off-road Highly recommended for someone looking for a lightweight, minimalist shoe which can still tick the following boxes:

- Enough support & stability for off-road. Feels more stable than the Flyknit Lunar 3. Feels as stable as the Lunarglide 8 without as much bulk.

- Super-soft, fluid, comfortable ride, with good rebound. Better cushioned than the Lunarglide 8 (could feel individual stones prodding my feet through these). If it wasn't for small stones getting stuck in the soles- which make a clicking noise on tarmac- wouldn't know they were there!

- Well-ventilated for hot days without being completely open/exposed for chilly days.

FIT: I have a narrow heel and a wide forefoot, and generally take a UK 8, sometimes a UK 7.5 on a looser shoe. The Lunarglide 8 was too tight in a UK 7.5, and too loose in a UK 8. I took the advice of the website and ordered these half a size up- perfect in the UK 8.5. 

GRIP: seem slightly looser on slick surfaces than rubber soles, but haven't actually skidded out, so I think they're grippy enough but just lack the stickiness of rubber. Feel a bit grippier than the Lunarglide 8.

DURABILITY: the lack of rubber looked less durable to begin with, but they're actually wearing fine after a month so not a disaster- only time will tell.",128972166
843764,1,09/10/2016,"this product is light but not enough support i got these shoes for running. i usually like trail running shoes but wanted to switch it up for extra support. i thought these would be a good balance of the two but nike had a rare miss with these. my feet hurt after a short 2 mile run and i only got them in july. they seem well made, and have not deterred me from buying nikes in the future",127400408
843764,4,08/17/2016,"Comfortable, needs TLC I received these shoes about three weeks ago. They’re a nice addition to the Flyknit family and a very comfortable shoe for everyday wear as well as running.
 
The shoes run true to size and the uppers, though a little tight when you first get them, loosen up a little bit with some wear and makes for a snug but comfy fit. The Flyknit gives excellent breathability, but picks up dirt pretty quickly and is a little tougher to clean.
 
The sole is on the thick side visually, but offers a very plush ride. You can actually feel the zoned pods on the bottom of the shoe, so they’re more than just for looks.
 
Debris tends to get stuck inside the cuts on the outsole and inside the rings on the bottom, but it’s nothing a toothpick and a few seconds can’t fix. The white outsole, though super-fresh, is a dirt magnet and turns grey pretty quickly. Again, if you give your shoes a little TLC, it’s not a big deal.
 
Overall, this is a comfortable shoe that looks good and performs well. It does get dirty easily, but just give it a little cleaning once in a while to keep up the fresh looks and you’ll be set!",124690271
843764,5,08/14/2016,Best running shoes ever!!! They fit perfectly. I have size 43 but bought a 44. They give excellent support and look great also.,124384374
843764,3,08/12/2016,"Very Comfortable but has flaws I really liked this shoe but you cant really run outside with these unless you are on a very clean sidewalk. Because of the way the sole of the shoes is designed, little rocks get stuck inside the sole and you can feel them when running. Loved the shoe but because i run and workout this shoe just wasn't stable enough for my preferences. My suggestion is that if you want to keep them clean keep them to indoor use because they pick up everything outside since they flex so much.",124154066
843764,5,07/26/2016,"Best Nike running shoe hands down I love this shoe feels like Im running on clouds couldnt be any happier, I first bought a pair (mids) and they hurt the back of my heal and with the new lows I get nothing but support.",120957657
843764,4,07/23/2016,"Comfortable... but room for improvement The positives. Excellent stretch knit feel. very comfortable. And nice overall bounce if you are a heal striker and roll your foot. The negative, for my style of running where i strike the mid and prefer more push from the toe these don't quite have the bounce i was looking and hoping for. close... but not quite there",120273666
843764,4,07/16/2016,"Uber comfort, little stones are a pain! I have been waiting for Nike to release these as I really wasn't taken with the ankle thing in the normal LunarEpics.
I have ran about 80km over the past couple of weeks and these are incredibly comfortable, they disappear on your feet.
The only negative thing I can say is little stones get stuck in the sole on an 'epic' scale. Of course if you're just pounding the pavements this isn't a problem, but for me it's going to be a new post run ritual it seems! We're not talking trail running, any and all little stones!!",118610053
843764,3,07/13/2016,So So I tried these on at the Nike store and ran in them on a treadmill. Unfortunately these shoes don't work for me. They designed the collar of the shoe to be higher than normal which causes it to land right on my outside ankle bone. The other complaint I would have about this shoe is the tongue. For a shoe of this caliber why on earth would you not design it with an integrated tongue? My personal opinion is that every shoe should have one. I much prefer the fit of the Lunarglide 8 (which I LOVE). Assuming the collar works for your ankle and the tongue isn't an issue I'm sure these would be great shoes for someone that doesn't need a ton of stability. PEACE.,117694929
843764,5,07/09/2016,"Real comfort Tested these out walking and running alike. I think lunar epic completes the movement away from minimalist shoes. This pair makes moving around feel easier.

849557,3,08/03/2017,"Beautiful Sneaker I was in search of a new running shoe and had been shopping around online for weeks before I saw the Nike Air Vapormax online in the light violet color. I was instantly obsessed and had to get them. I called a few Nike stores to find this color since it is exclussive and they dont sell them online. I finally located my size at the Nike store at the Grove. The staff there was awesome and they held the shoe for me till the end of the day. I was super excited to try them on and once I did, I was in love with the style and they were comfy when I walked around in them. It is definitly a beautifully made sneaker but I just went for my first run today and I wanted to turn back after just one mile. Ive ran in Nike for years so I assumed the fit and comfort level would be the same as the lunar glide and Pegasus but it was a painful run. I pushed through and finished a short 3 mile run but even my pace was significantly slower due to the discomfort from the sneakers. I also tried wearing them for my Zumba class and they were just way too bouncy to dance around in.I would recommend these shoes for walking or for fashion but I will definitely not be running in these.",167859094

I ended up returning them and just a big shout out to Nike for how painless that process was also.,166331556
849557,5,07/13/2017,"What shin splints? I was looking at retiring my trusty Asics after nearly 300 trail miles, and had decided to switch back to my trusty Nike Airs since I didn't need to wear superfeet insoles with those, but needed to with the Asics. However, my Nike Run Club app showed me a timely advertisement for the Vapormax, and I was very intrigued, and as a result, I was now indecisive. I had decided to break out my Free RN natural that I bought only for treadmill running, for my afternoon 4 mile pavement run (until I decided on Air Max or VaporMax). After 3 unbearable, shin splinty miles, I limped home. The very next day I went to the only store in town with the VaporMax, knowing how well my Nike Airs treated me, and decided to take the plunge. Not only were they incredibly attractive, but I couldn't wait to run in them, even though my shins told me that I should probably hold off. I did manage to talk myself into a 2 mile walk around the neighborhood, rather than stay home. When i hit the bottom of the steps and put my earbuds in my ear, it was like my legs took over, and decided they were going for a run - despite the soreness in my calfs. Now, let me tell you...When I hit that first high impact step in the Vapormax, the shoe was not only forgiving, but sprang into action. My shin splints had all but DISAPPEARED. I proceeded to run 2 nearly painless 11 minute miles in the hills of Pittsburgh with little pain or effort. The next morning, my calves felt completely normal.",166249100

I wish the blue was a bit lighter/translucent since it looks more like baby blue. Other than the color, I really like the shoe. I will admit that it took me 20 minutes to get used to it. I almost gave up because my feet hurt so much. If you have high arches or a wide foot, this shoe will be way too uncomfortable. The shoe snuggles around your feet tightly. Well after 20 minutes of running, my foot adjusted to the new shoe and now I love running in them. I will purchase another pair. The only other complaint that I have is the shoe strings tend to come loose quite often. Oh one other item, the size of the shoe runs long.",165712943

Over the two days of use I felt increased pressure under my right foot. I chalked it up to a break in period but the problem persists. I assume the defect in the shoe is that the front lateral air pod is either over inflated or built up more than it should be. This is also a very narrow shoe. I have owned more pairs of Nikes than I can think of and I have never placed my foot in a more narrow pair of shoes. I shouldve sized up .5 us mens.

I do have a narrow foot, so I would not recommend the shoe to someone that traditionally runs wide. I haven't ran in these nor do I plan to.

849558,2,09/25/2017,"Uneven Wear The shoes are amazingly light, super cushioned, and fun to run in. The downside has everything to do with durability and build quality. I have worn Nike Air Max for years and the Free Run line for quite some time as well. The sole pads on my right shoe feel softer and more malleable than the left shoe. After two months of running the right shoe shows excessive wear while the left shoe is still looking brand new. With these results you would probably read this and say it is the way I run, not the shoe that is to blame. These are the only shoes I have owned and run in that show these uneven results. 
I sent the shoes in to Nike to be inspected and was told that the build quality is fine and free of defects. 

I will run in them until they wear down completely to get my moneys worth, but I probably won’t buy another pair without checking the sole pad density first.",170299671

This shoes are not great right out of the box you have to break them in. Now that I have 26 miles on them they feel great. I am a mid sole runner so they give a good bounce and forward momentum. If you are a heel strike runner I would not recommend them due to they way the air pockets are one the heel. The outside of the heel is reinforced more then the inside of the heel. That may lead to problems with your ankle. Overall for me they are a great running shoe once the a broken in.,169751280

After the first week break-in, the airbox outsole start contouring to my feet. Now, I am very satisfied with the shoes's light weight, breathable, flexibility and cushioning air box.
The air outsole is not a continuous piece like normal shoes. The outsole welded with several detached airboxes. At first, your foot palm may rest on the gap between airboxes and feel no support. After the shoes break-in, the foot palm's weight will distribute evenly onto the outsole.",169305937

849558,5,08/10/2017,"They're here As a Air Max fan I had to have a pair of these bad boys. I did get the ""Explorer"" style upon the drop. What a month or two (summer 2017) of some of the best styles dropped by Nike. Back to this air, it is different from all of the other Air Max. If you don't own a pair, stop sleeping on these. Although these don't last long on shelves or online, good luck. Now about the size and fit, IMO, slightly narrow and true to size. However if you wear thicker socks you need to go a half size up. The material is very stretchy so break em in. Give it a try, you can always return it in 30 days if its not a good match for your feet. These are the lightest airs I own including all my other flyknit kicks. Great invention on these. Thanks Nike team of scientists!",168473029

Although these shoes are aesthetically pleasing, they seriously lack in performance. Yes, they are incredibly light and feel as if you have more bounce to your step, they are not durable. After less than 2 months of owning these, part of the air max bubble popped while I was on the treadmill. Needless to say I will not make the same mistake again.",167595354

as far as sizing i feel they fit true to size, UNLESS you have wide feet, then i suggest you go a HALF size up. I do feel the flyknit ""stretches"" slighty on the sides once broken in though.",166292386

In fact, I would say they're not bouncy at all. Maybe it was just because it was the first time I'd worn them but then again I've bought other Nike's that fealt great right out of the box (Nike Flyknit Lunar 3).

The Vapormax is truly unique experience. If I had to describe how it feels I would say it is soft and comfortable but offers resistance at the same time.

These 11.5's fit great - perfect sizing! It was clear that I needed to break them in a little bit, but that only took wearing them twice. They are super comfortable and they look super sharp. I have the blue pair, but will either buy the red pair - or another blue for back-up. I cannot comment on whether they will be durable.

The rubber sole of the shoes ware very quickly, and it didn't take long for them to wear to the point the the air bag was exposed though the bottom in multiple locations. This eventually caused the air bag in the right shoe to lose pressure. The sole of the left shoe also appeared to not have been installed correctly near the inside ball portion of the shoe. This is a real shame considering the brand and the premium asking price. I mostly wear my athletic shoes for everyday wear, and do not abuse them through training.

However, the durability of these shoes are by far the worst i have ever experienced, and i barely run in them. The cushion is usually the first to go for me, then the tread... and it goes fast.

Whether it would be something to go over or under the toe area just to make it more solid as i hit my toe on something whilst wearing these and the material has now left a dent.

849559,3,09/16/2017,"Still needs work to be a great shoes. Usually wear 11.5 size in Rockports, but wear a size 13 in Nike Air Max, so the Nike runs small and narrow compared to other name brand shoes. The tongue is sewn onto the shoes cover on both sides and this is uncomfortable for me because the tongue compresses my feet around my arches and top of foot area. I resorted to cutting one side on the tongue off to allow less compression to my foot on the 2016 and 2017 models and this has proved to increase foot comfort noticeably. Besides being one of the most expensive Nike running shoes, currently there are only three styles/colors to choose from. Otherwise, you need to custom order a shoe design and this would be more expensive. The workmanship and quality of materials are good and the design of the shoes is one of the things about this shoes that I like best. So long as Nike does not vary and change their shoes sizes, I can live with ordering their shoes.",170056764

849559,4,06/10/2017,"2017 Air Max’s styling is lacking sophistication this year. This is for the Nike Footwear Designers and fellow Nike running sneakers enthusiasts. I have a medium to narrow with foot and I need great arch support. With that said I want I need a quality durable sneaker that's going to last, not fall apart in weeks. I need and want an exceptional glove like fit with excellent support underfoot and a durable upper that will last so once they start wearing out I wear my running sneakers as work sneakers for around the house. $190 sneakers should be exceptionally well designed and made! I only buy my sneakers in All-Black and multiple pairs, so I have backup when Nike doesn't make something that fits my foot properly. The best running sneakers I've ever owned are: 2002 Nike Shock NZs, Nike Shock Turbo 2013’s, Nike Air Max 2013’s, *Nike Air Max 2015’s, Solomon's Speed Cross 3 GTX, All fit with total precision! Out of all the sneakers I've listed the best looking and the most comfortable are the Nike Air Max 2015’s! The Nike Air Max 2016’s fit wider they have a much more rounded toe-box and my feet and toes slosh around. They have gone too wide on the 2016's. The whole point of the Air Max’s is that they should fit like a glove and offer great support. Nike Designers should stick with the Nike template of offering a snugger fitting sneaker, and why not offer the same seeker in a wide version for people with wide feet, which I do NOT have. Don't mess with the formula, just offered two different widths of the same seeker. I found the 2016’s seems to be sloppy on my foot, I do like the longer tongue but there is nothing to hold the tongue down from moving around, there's nowhere you can slide a lace through to secure it better. The amazing 2002 Nike Shock NZs had a built-in tongue so it fit your foot like a glove. On an elite running sneaker I want to toe-box to be more pointed and to offer more durability on the big toe, the 2016's are so rounded and they lack a secure toe-box fitment. I loved the styling of the Nike Air Zoom All Out Flyknit with the Mid-cut collar that provided a locked-down fit and slightly more ankle support but it totally lacked any real support under foot. In Niketown standing and moving side-to-side I could have just rolled my ankle, not good! So sticking with the Air Max’s for durability and support! But the 2017's Air Max’s styling is lacking sophistication but I do like that the tongue is not flopping around.",163471435

849559,1,01/14/2017,"Bad design I am an avid Nike user, and love your sneakers. I just purchased another pair of Air Max 2017, as I thought it will be really comfortable. The problem with these is that the tongue is attached to the sides on both sides and it makes the fit so tight. It really doesn't matter if you loosen the lace either. Because the tongue is fit at a specific fit and hugs the feet so tight that the toes feel numb after running for a while. So please let me know how I can return these and get a different style with a thick enough sole. Thank you.",143701962
849559,1,01/10/2017,"Major size issue The tongue on the 2017 model is connected on both sides. What a horrible idea!!! I have been wearing Air Max for the last 10 years and love them, but these do not fit my foot at all. I could barely get them on due to the connected tongue. Very narrow. NIKE - Make them the correct size please.",142836265
849559,2,01/10/2017,"Way Too Small & Narrow I could barely get my feet into them out of the box, but since they're mesh I figured they'd stretch quite a bit after a few miles. I figured wrong. I love the looks of the shoes, the Black/Anthracite looks cool and the swoosh reflects well at night. I can't find the box to return them and I've now put 30 + miles on them, so I guess I've pretty much screwed myself as far as any return/exchange for the next size up. My advice to anyone considering these is to order at least a half size larger than you normally wear.",142834176
849559,4,01/08/2017,Ref shoe I struggle to find all black shoes to referee in that have good cushioning and are completely black. I ordered these in a men's 7 which is what I wear in the Zoom Vomero but these run very small and narrow. I will be sending them back in the hopes that a size up will help! I tried ordering the boys but they were black that faded into grey and I am required to wear all black. fingers crossed.,142306075
849559,5,01/06/2017,"First air max, and I love it I've wanted the AirMax running shoes for years, however every time I tried them on, the toe box of a 13 was way too pointed and narrow, while the 14 was enormous. I tried the 2017 model and was pleasantly surprised that the toe box material is more flexible and not so pointed.

I bought these primarily for work, as I walk and stand on concrete quite often and need something cushy to take the load off my knees and back. I don't go running in these, as they are more of an 'every day' type of shoe.

Unfortunately I'm really a 13.5, so the 13s are too snug and the 14 felt a bit too roomy. I gambled and got the 14, and am glad I did. The upper is flexible enough that when I tighten the laces, it snugs up and conforms to my foot.

I had a pair of the Tailwinds, and thought they were rock hard and not comfortable, but these are incredible. They seem to break in a little and soften up, which was nice. They felt overly firm on day 1, but they are way more comfortable after wearing them for a couple months.",142119018
849559,1,01/01/2017,"Disappointing While I like the new look- this is a disappointing product- after 20 years of no-brainer sizing and comfort, Nike really messed up with this- it is too stiff and small- really, really disappointing ... I'm totally bummed that I will have to look for a new sneaker brand- I'm going to send these back and never buy anything Nike again- Atta go morons",141593586
849559,5,11/14/2016,Air Max I have bought air maxes for now 3 years and I'm proud to say that these are much better than the previous. In so many ways.,134614553
849559,5,11/11/2016,"7 times better than the previous version I bought 2 pairs yesterday. I am in love with these shoes. I have the 2016 version in black and blue and the differences are substantial. 
1. First you will find that the tongue on the 2017 version is connected on both sides in a continuos way and not detached like in the 2016 version which is quite annoying. 
2. The swoosh is being moved on both sides of the shoes as well in order to be visible where is required and not on almost top of the shoes as in the 2016 version.
3. Shoes are made in Vietnam, which means more quality oriented than China. 
4. The colors of material are real and beautiful, Black is actual black!
5. The color of the soles are in tone with the main color of the shoes, which looks much better than previous clear version
6. In general the material is excellent and absolutely more durable than 2016 version
7. Comfort is exactly the same, slightly more narrow wearing of the 2017 version

Finally I am extremely satisfied of the improvement of the Air Max 2017 version, I am looking forward to buy the Green and Red/Orange version as well of this model. The best in the Running Shoes market today.

I absolutely recommend these shoes to anybody looking for a professional pair of running sneakers",134259260

When I first put them on, they felt good (no pressure on the back where the shoe rests on the achilles tendon). I went walking and they felt a bit clunky, but I thought it was just the comparison to the Fly Knits. I went on a few runs and my toes got so sore. The shoes made my feet hurt. I gave them several chances, and the comfort never got better. I am so disappointed I spent this much money on shoes I will never be able wear.",163733990
849560,1,06/12/2017,"On my 2nd return I was so excited when I got my 2017 Air Maxes to add to my collection. Sadly, I was also quickly dissappointed. After 3 weeks and not wearing them every day, they did not feel right. Turns out the cushion had deflated. I called into customer service and exchanged them. They never sent a return label, had to make another call to get one. Finally, I was able to return them & after 2 weeks & no update called again & was told, hold on while we process the return. If I did not call in I would still be waiting. A week later almost I received my replacement pair. They are very nice at customer service but you should not have to make so many phone calls & waste so much time. This is the 2nd return. I bought two pair of sneakers & they were both defective.

Most sport shoe companies' shoes run narrow and most do not offer wide and extra wide choices (thank you Nike!). . . 

BUT if a shoe is labeled ""4E"" and ""Extra-Wide"" I expect something more than I received. These are the narrowest Nike Structure shoes in many years (I've been wearing Structures, extra-wide, since model 14 or so and none have been this narrow.)",175543419

After a few months of occasional wear the rubber on the front toe is already pealing up and the fabric around the ankle Is worn and tearing already. The shoe is also very narrow compared to last structures which I loved. I feel quality has defenitly dropped with this version.

849576,5,07/09/2017,"Still a great stability shoe! They're better than I expected. I've had my Zoom Structure 19s for a year now, and I've beat the Zoom Air cushion to death, so it was time to get a new stability shoe. I was worried about the move away from toe-box flywires to ankle flywires, and the change from loops to the ""Dynamic Fit"" system. My feet are narrow at the arch, so I often find myself needing to cinch the middle. The wider toe-box and overall narrowness of Nike seems to have alleviated that, and the dynamic fit system works better than I expected it to. It looks too unified and blocky, but it actually moves pretty well without pinching or warping. It was nice to have a fully functional Zoom cushion under my forefoot again, and I managed 2 miles in a row, which I haven't been able to do in my old Structure 19s for a while. In the store, I tried out the Lunar Glide 8s, and while I appreciated that they have the stability of the Structure 20s, the Lunar-foam is something I would only want if I was actually doing a long-distance race, since it's clearly a little lighter and squishier than the Zoom cushion, but for training the responsiveness of the Zoom is really what I'm looking for.",165985147

I never put a thought of buying a pair of Stability sneaker until I have tried the 18 onward. Whenever I run,every strike onto the ground the shoe was so amazed to cope and maintain my fallen arch in position without further rolling inwards. I can enjoyed the great cushioning, light weight and without any stability issues. It has been an alternative choice for me other than motion control sneakers. My only comments is I believed that this model will also help those runners with fallen arch problem (overpronator) and benefit greatly from the stability if the curve design for the arch section of the sneaker straighten further a bit from the heel to mid foot. Great Sneaker.",161562350

The front of the shoe feels like you're running on a plank(and a thin one at that). Really disappointing because the last edition was superb. You overdid the structure side of the comfort/support equation.
The back section of the shoe feels fine, but overall I'm hoping they give out before my feet do so I can try a different shoe style.",160143704
849576,2,03/19/2017,"Felt okay for a bit, then went things went south I've been running in Structure's for the better part of a decade and was a big fan of the 19's. I've had most iterations of the model, but the heel and toe box with these have changed and caused slippage and the rear and a little *too* much room in the toe box. They felt fine enough for the first 50 miles I logged, but over time I developed a nagging achilles problem due to the restructured heel and a overwound ankle because of a change in some type of support/fit around the mid-foot and/or under the arch.

I later dropped in some Superfeet hoping they might help, but in the end they couldn't fix the fundamental issue with the 20's, so I've gone back to the 19's and my form/comfort/pain are all steadily improving again. For a stability shoe, the 20's were surprisingly (and regrettably) soft.

849576,5,02/24/2017,"Great Shoe Love this shoe! Not sure what people are complaining about, maybe they just walk in them or something which would explain bad reviews as most of the cushion is in the front. If you need support for running and are a mid-foot/forefoot striker, these shoes are great. The best shoes I ran in before these where the Zoom Elite 8, but since I have been training for a marathon, I needed more support and cushioning for longer runs. I have a slight pronation on my left foot which allows me to wear neutral shoes for regular training and runs up to 8-10 miles, but anything longer, I'll get shin splints and IT band issues. The answer... the Structure 20... I hated the 18 and the 19... but these are perfect for my marathon training as I add up the miles, I have had zero issues and have ran in comfort the whole time. I have 2 pairs to rotate and honestly, I consider these my shoes of choice for any run. The only down side is the tongue slips a little but I have weird feet and tongues seem to slip on all of them. I don't miss the flywire. In my opinion, the lack of flywire is a bonus... you shouldn't be tightening your running shoes that much to utilize it, they should be just slightly snug while tied as you put them on. All in all, a great shoe thats balanced and lasts miles.",152281813

I've tried Lunarglides, Zoom Elites and recently the Structures. I've not tried any other brand apart from Nike's. This is the first time I am writing a review. Of the shoes I've tried, I personally prefer the Structures since it gives me the best arch/heel support and I've noticed less aches & pains either on short or long runs.

849576,1,01/29/2017,"It's not good news unfortunately This will be the first review i have ever wrote and for good reason.
Disclaimer!
I am a little obsessed with everything Nike, haven't wore or even tried a different sports product for 15 years.
I discovered lunerglides 3, years back and were absolutely fantastic, had them up till lunarglides 5 then i found the structure and have been wearing them year on year so obviously when the 20 came out, i was first in line to grab me one of those sexy beasts. Tried in store and felt a little more ""structured"" then my 19's. i thought this was a good thing. Few days later, it was time to give these bad boys a go. Done a 5 mile walk, They felt way too hard so i went straight home and put on my trusted 19's. finished a few chores i had left and called it a day. I was in trouble the next morning, I literally couldn't walk on my feet. I felt like my forefoot was walking on rocks. Bare in mind, I don't run marathons or anything of that nature, just walking and light training at my local gym. Back to my painful feet. I never felt anything like that so i got it checked out. Wait for it... turns out, i have ""plantar fasciitis"" now lets get something straight, im not saying the structure 20 is going to lead you onto this horrible syndrome but just make sure you have a good walk around in store before you make your purchase. It has been 2 weeks now and im still suffering and I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy as it can completely put you out of service, Which was in my case.

I still love Nike and haven't complained, infact, i forced myself to go to the Nike store in westfields and took the new Pegasus 33 for a long test drive around the store and they felt great. They were the only shoe that eased my plantar fasciitis pain, of course i had to purchase them... oh the irony.

Conclusions.

Always walk around the store for as long as you can before you make any decision. The Nike team fully understand and wont hover over you and be like... ""hurry up and buy"" 

Hope this helps.",148733313

For the first time in years i could standon feet all day and my feet not hurt. Of course I had no reason to think the new version would be any different. Well I was wrong.

849664,5,12/18/2016,"Just the ticket for cold-weather running I primarily do my running along Chicago's lakefront. In the winter, there is a good amount of slush, ice, and water, and I frequently have cold and wet feet when I return from a run.

Winter arrived a little later this year, but hit with a vengeance. I've taken these shoes out several times in fresh snowfall, freezing rain, and slushy conditions.

They have performed really well - the aggressive tread pattern on the bottom gives me a lot of confidence in bad weather. On small issue is that the tread gets little rocks wedged in it really easily, and bits of the tread can get damaged if the rocks force the tread open and expose it to damage. Just clean the rocks out every so often and you'll be good to go.

These shoes are water resistant, and will do a much better job of keeping your feet dry than regular running shoes, but they're not waterproof, so splashing in puddles will bring in a little dampness. Breathability is good, and your feet won't get all sweaty and clammy.

Cushioning is excellent, just like the regular LunarEpic Flyknit shoes they're based on. The soles are a medium grey color with speckles, so they won't really show dirt like the regular LunarEpics do.

The fit is great, once you get used to the sockliner around your ankles. For me, wearing a sock that came up above the bootie worked best, as I had some rubbing and chafing when I wore low or no-show socks. Everything is sealed up really well, and there's no tongue for road salt and sand to work its way under.

Overall, this is a great shoe for a specific purpose - outdoor winter running. I really like my pair and would give them a strong recommendation!",139763453
849664,5,12/07/2016,"Warm and Cozy I bought these shoes for winter running so my feet could stay warm and dry. The first thing I noticed about these shoes is the soles. They have a ridiculous amount of cushion. It feels like I'm running on clouds. The shoes also provide the perfect amount of breath-ability, and warmth. I've run once with these shoes in the snow and they did a great job of keeping my feet dry. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone who is looking for durable yet comfy running shoe.",138207922
849664,5,11/14/2016,"Felt like I needed to leave a review I finally decided to make the switch to Nike running and I was blown away. I value comfort in a running shoe the most and this sneaker delivers big time. Theyre very lightweight and the sole has great cushioning. If youre a fan of sock like sneakers then I promise this sneaker is for you. I havent tested them out in rainy weather yet but I sure cant wait to try. If they truly keep my feet dry, which I imagine they will, then to me this is the perfect running sneaker. I do recommend buying them in person so you could try them on before purchasing. I had to buy a half size larger.",134616456
849664,5,11/04/2016,Weather resistance! My initial impressions after one run and wearing all day. Picked up a pair this morning and ran a few miles in wet weather and my feet were dry! I felt like the shoe breathed well. Traction was solid on slippery painted surfaces and ground with lots of leaves this time of year. I'm based in Seattle and this fall has been very wet and muddy. A shoe like this will benefit anyone looking to work out outside wanting a higher top weather resistant version. Will also test in gym over the next few weeks. Thanks Nike!,133517390

Ever since then, though, I have realised that this is probably one of the best shoes I have ever used. I have stopped using my other shoes in favour of using this. The comfort and the look both make this shoe great and it is also very durable. I have had it for 6 months and have used it for many things but nothing has happened to it.

863764,5,11/05/2017,"Vomero is STILL it! I had been using Vomero 10s but couldn't find them anymore so I jumped to the V12. At first, they seemed to have less overall shock absorption than the previous V10. I was afraid that this new version would be so different that I would have to seek out another shoe. As I continued to wear them for regular runs, that impression turned to one of stability. I really like the lightness of the shoe as well as the breathability of the material and overall fit. The lacing gives complete comfort while providing the utmost sense of the shoe being one with my foot. While I haven't used them in snowy or very wet conditions, I anticipate that they will deliver like the old Vomeros. As always, Nike melds function with style.

The Vomero has been my favorite running shoe lines, which I've owned over twenty of them in the past eight years. Unfortunately, I wore through the bottom of these V12s by the toes in less than 150 miles. I hope it was just defective pair, because I can't afford to keep replacing them in less than two months. Previous Vomeros averaged about 300 miles for me. I am 5'9"" and 170lbs.

Although extremely comfortable, the durability wasn't there. I then bought these and have been running in them for about 2 weeks and I think I am a converted Vomero guy now. Great fit. I feel the toe box is a little wide but still a great fit. Great cushion. Feels soft like Lunars but I feel the shoe is more responsive. Also, the traction of the shoe seems to be way more durable than the Lunar Epics and the Zoom Fly's which i was using earlier this year. It's just a solid shoe. Very neutral too. You get soft cushion but you also get a responsiveness of a harder soled shoe. I will definitely be buying another pair of these soon. One recommendation for Nike, if you could make this into a true flyknit show, that would be dope.",169450834

They seem to have the best blend and compromise of cushioning,comfort,stability and weight of any shoes I've ever had.

I usually wear size 10 but returned them for 10.5 which provided for a thumbnail of room for my big toe in the toe box. My foot is borderline 10 > 10.5. The regular width was perfect.",167755712

Having previous iterations before, I found I needed to skip or pass a generation of this shoe because of various changes that were made. Last one I had was the 10, which I thought couldn't be beat, but was I surprised with this version 12! 
Super super comfortable and cushiony without feeling like you don't have contact with the ground. Amazingly done Nike!

But in all those earlier Vomeros, I was a regular/D width size 9. In the Vomero 12, I tried it in my regular size and the length was perfect, but definitely pinching my lateral forefoot on both feet. Returned, and got a pair of 9 wide from a local retailer. Perfect fit, and very happy with the cushioning. Had a mild hot spot on my inner right heel, but could have been a sock issue.

863764,5,06/19/2017,"Favorite long distance shoe I switched from the Pegasus to the Vomero starting with the Vomero 11. My only complaint with the 11 was poor arch support. The Vomero 12 has better arch support. It is now my favorite shoe. 

I got 400 miles out of the Vomero 11's and they're still in my rotation. I expect something similiar from the Vomero 12.

Overall the shoe is more comfortable and feels a little more cushioned, but in a firm way. Plush is probably a good description. The 12 feels slightly less responsive than either the Vomero 11 or the old Pegasus. It is a fair trade for the improved arch and cushion.

I have a neutral stride, extreme heel strike and flat feet. I've struggled with plantar fasciitis among other things. This shoe feels great to me. Just enough support and a very neutral feel.

Looking forward to getting a lot of miles in these shoes.",164118294

I've had several cars stop as they meet/pass me and the drivers tell me they could see my shoes from way off.,161686380

No slippage, chaffing or blisters with this shoe whereas I dealt with all of those in the 11 to start. Ran 6 miles with them right out of the box with no issues whatsoever. The toe box feels roomier and the mid foot feels wider than the previous version. A very soft, comfortable ride.

I must admit my life has changed! Walking was the primary utility for which I got these and this shoe has helped me do just that, with ease after a very long time.

Bravo Nike! You have finally done it right with this one! Speaking personally I never could believe anything out there could reduce my tiresome ordeals, I had to go through, in a simple walk around the grocery store. This shoe has allowed me to do a lot more in them!

The comfort, you feel when wearing them, is simply unimaginable. The plush support on the heel and the weightlessness of the shoe...one cannot express what I have felt with these in the past few days. 

For any individual out there, living it through with a disability - I'd recommed you atleast try these on! Moving around has never been this easy and comfortable! This just might work for you too.

*Outsole Heel padding is best of any Vomero model. 
*10mm drop instead of 12. 
*Reflective in heel. Nike Swoosh is reflective if black. 
*Fit in upper is better due to flywire change.

The mid-sole is more cushioned and along with the outsole which is also softer the feel is much softer and quite welcome. The fly wire technology is better employed and locks in your foot much better. The color choices are numerous and quite varied and very updated over the past offerings.

The material was so thin, when I tightened the lace it would actually cut into my feet, creating huge blisters. This model remedied that problem, and I like find them more comfortable. However, after running on these for four months and putting just under 150 miles on them, the sole of the shoe underneath the ball of my foot is completely worn down. The soles are far too soft, so road running/my stride have caused the soles to wear too quickly in my opinion.

I love this shoe I was looking for a very comfortable shoe for running and I finally found it..Im a petite person but I noticed some of the running shoes I was using would cause my feet to hurt and I couldnt run as much as I wanted to but with these shoes I feel like Im gliding as I run ! My knees dont hurt when I run anymore either ! I was a little skeptical about the colors of the shoe but I bought the Cerulean/Thunder Blue/Space Blue/Glacier Blue one and it is such a pretty color !

Primarily I run on the treadmill, occasionally outside.
However, I am extremely selective when choosing a shoe for running and need a specific fit to be comfortable.
That being said, this shoe is a very suitable cross training or walking shoe as well. Super comfy:)
This shoe has both perfect stability and cushion.
It is true to size. I wear an 8, but prefer a bit of room with my running shoes in the toe area and go a size to size and a half larger typically.
I would recommend going at least a half size larger than your regular size.
I like the basic clean look usually, as I don't always care for too much bling and too much going on when it comes to the look of a running shoe.
Extremely impressed overall and have no complaints at all with this product!!
I would definitely buy another pair.",161296379
863766,5,03/16/2017,"Great shoe, beware of color I purchased the ""Hot Punch"" color, which looked like a bright coral color. First things first, the Vomero 12. It's an excellent shoe! Light, flexible and amazing cushioning. The fit was true to size as my usual athletic shoe size fit well. I have wide feet and while these did accommodate my feet, they ever so slightly pressed across my toes when I stood on my tippy toes, or otherwise exaggerated a bend on the foot. The bend there, around the toes was only very slightly uncomfortably snug. Not enough for me to exchange for a wide however, yet still worth a mention to be thorough. The padding is excellent. I didn't find the tongue overly thick as others disliked from the Vomero 11. These were honestly a solid choice. I did not test them on a run because, despite the shoe fitting well, I knew I would be returning them. Now, on to color....the Hot Punch is an extremely bright neon, almost highlighter orange looking color. Not nearly as appealing as it looks online. At a size 9.5, you can see me coming a mile away with these. They seemed to really ""highlight"" my big feet. They simply did not appeal to me, on my feet. Otherwise, definitely worth trying a different color.",154870383

They don't feel heavy or ""mushy"" yet they have plenty of cushion and support (I'm a neutral runner, average arches, <150lb). Compared to the Vomero 11, they are similar yet maybe a tad more responsive feeling. Please, Nike - never change a thing about this shoe! Except for the option of more colors in Narrow widths! :) I love that it comes in NARROW widths, the reason why this shoe just fits perfectly! It's as if they're tailor made.

It gives all the normal cushioning benefits you'd expect out of the Air Zoom line, but is light enough to use on the track for speed work or racing. It really is amazing how light this shoe is.

The extra cushioning also makes it a great shoe for taking off the track. If you're training for a mid-distance race (like a 5, 10 or even 15K) this is a great training or race day shoe as well. It'll give you the support and cushioning you need to tackle those longer distances without a ton of fatigue.

It took me around 2 weeks to break them and I could comfortably run a 10k in them. They are fast, light and offer perfect support especially if you are a forefoot striker.

The Flyknit and the way the laces tie allow the shoes to grasp on to my feet very well, making my run more natural and comfortable than before. The shoes are also very light. I am coming from a pair of Air Zoom Pegasus 33's, and I was amazed by the LunarEpic's weight. However, they are a bit too narrow for me. I cannot really complain, because I have pretty wide feet. But that does not change the fact that they are tight and that I got blisters on the sides of my feet after the first time running with them. Additionally, whenever I run on dirt, a bunch of small rocks get stuck to the bottom of the sole. They do not seem to affect my running experience much, but to avoid having a rock collection in my shoe, I manually take the rocks out after every run.

Unfortunately, they're too narrow, particularly for high arches, and with no opening between the tongue and the sides of the shoes, they hug the foot too snugly, making them pretty uncomfortable.

863779,4,09/23/2017,"Comfortable Shoes, Yet Unresponsive The shoes run true to size in length but are narrow along the foot owing to the ""socklike"" upper. This is shocking at first if you're unused to it but the upper does give some over time. The heel cup does run a little narrow, and the insert will shift, so it is important that you place the insert where it feels best on the heel before break-in and take care to keep it there to maximize the comfort of the shoe over time. 

All that being said, the shoe is relatively ""squishy"" which makes for a comfortable walking or running shoe if you don't want the responsiveness of Zoom or Pebax plating in the sole.

With only one walk of 2.5 miles...I have the following observations:
- At first, the shoe felt snug. Not unusual, since the fabric/upper is designed to mold to your foot like a sock. I thought it would get better as the fabric was broken in/stretched...but I was wrong.
- Shoe runs narrow. My toes were so compressed that the nail of big toe dug into the side of my other toe.
- Heel cup runs small/narrow. I have four blisters on my heels. I've never had than with any other running shoe...to include Nike.
- Inserts are cheap. Mine shifted to one side during my walk. Again...never had that with any other shoe.

I hope someone finds this review useful. I run 30+ miles and I am training for Marine Corps Marathon. I have been always running with shoes that has been recommend to me by different local runners stores in DC (according to my stride, etc...) I decided to change and buy a Nike runnings shoes after attending NRC+ events. I wanted to try something lighter and maybe faster. And hey, the shoes look super nice!

I went to the flagship store in Georgegetown and, I have chatted with different representatives online. All of them recommended me this pair of shoes because they have cushion while they are light. I wanted something to run tempos and long runs. I used them for 10 days, in recovery runs (3miles), speed workouts (6 miles) and a couple of long runs (10 miles and 12 miles). After those 10 days, I had IT syndrome (I also used the Adidas boost and glide those days for different sessions). So I stopped running and I xtraining while I exercised my hip and improved stability. After several PT sessions, the doctor asked me about the history of this and, he told me I should not wear this shows because the IT band may be caused by them. A poor arch support fit in this shoes (it does not have it at all) and a weak hip can may cause it.

It has been 31 days, exactly since I got them. I am not concerned about the return policy as I may not be able to make it - I would like to try the pegasus instead but I am afraid to try Nike again. I am upset because I have not been able to run for the past 20 days and I have lost endurance and speed. I am very sad about this situation and I regret I did not get a good advise either in the flagship store either online.

863779,1,05/17/2017,"Very Disappointed I have been a buyer of only Nike shoes for many years. This is the first time I have been completely disappointed in a product. I bought 2 pairs of these shoes about 2 months ago. I have been using one of them to walk on the treadmill 3-4 times a week for 3 miles each time. The foam sole on the inside of both shoes has essentially completely worn down to virtually nothing. The shoes are no longer useable
and explains some discomfort I was feeling yesterday after I noticed it.
Hopefully I can go to store and return unused pair. 
Taking the price into account a huge disappointment.",161772823
863779,5,05/16/2017,"Do. Not. Change. A. Thing. Whenever a running shoe is released, it happens: folks write in, saying, ""The shoe runs too narrow"", or ""I don't have enough toe splay"" or something along those lines. Well, I've got words for you: go find another shoe. If you like shoes that fit like a glove, like a training version of your racing spikes (with enough cushioning and support for a good 13 mile training run), look no more--pull out your credit card and grab these. They are perfect. For the love of all that is holy, Nike, please ignore the ""Make the standard version of this shoe wider"" crowd and send them to one of your other models.

863779,4,05/13/2017,Solid Great Looking Shoe Beautiful looking shoe. Get lots of compliments on them. Really padded sole that gives a very comfortable feeling. My only complaint is that the heel feels very blunt - definitely does not conform to the heel so there is a little slip in that area. Also the shoe seems to keep your weight back on the heel. I really enjoy the shoes and they are more comfortable then 95% of all other shoes I have tried.  True to size but a little more narrow then others. I have only had the shoes for about a week so I cannot speak to their durability. If like any of my other nikes Im sure these will last a long time. Certainly recommend these shoes.,161503319

863779,4,05/08/2017,"Tips to make them comfortable I have been on a journey to find a replacement for the LunarEclipe running shoes. The LunarEpic 2 has been my latest attempt. When I first got these, and for the first 80 miles wearing them, I hated them. The shoe was so tight in my left heel and just felt akward. They are bit more narrow than any other running shoe I have had in the past so be aware of that. I have found a way to like them.
One tip to get them comfortable is to loosen the laces a lot before putting them on. Then, don't tighten the laces much, just enough to take up the slack. This solved the issue I was having with the tightness and akward fit in the heel.

PROS-
-Light weight and the flyknit is super comfortable

CONS-
-Takes a bit of trial and error to get them comfortable.
- Soles pick up every single pebble in the known universe.
- The insole is super flimsy and tends to shift around during your run. Would be nice to see something with some more structure so it stays in place.",160832343

863779,2,04/07/2017,"Diappointing Had the Free 5.0 for a year or so, and had the Free 3.0 for a couple years before that. Both were getting beat up, decided to go with the latest Nike Running/Casual shoe. Big mistake, these shoes are a let down. All the Nike Free's seem to have a normal american cut, but this shoe has a very narrow cut. I've had tons of shoes before, but this is the first one that hasn't fit well because it's too narrow. Made me wonder for a second if I had wide feet, but it's the shoe. Break in occurs after about 30 minutes (you feel the flyknit loosen a little/conform better), but that doesn't change the width. I wear size 10.5 for most shoes, Nike Free's I wear 11. These shoes I got 11, and the length is fine, but side walls and toe box area are too tight. Makes for a constricted feel (not in a good way). In terms of comfort, Nike 3.0 were by far the most comfortable, like you were walking on clouds, then Nike 5.0 was less comfortable, more like a normal running sneaker. Lunarepic Lows are this awkward shoe where you feel like you're walking on heels, and only the hot spots of the sole are comfortable (where the lunar lawn is), yet the shoe almost like rocks around. It's just a weird and unnecessary design. It might be good for running if you have perfect form, heel and toe land in perfect flat succession; but otherwise it's awkward, and uncomfortable. Not a good casual shoe. I'd recommend one of their more normal shoes, at the very least to get rid of the massive sole which makes it feel like you have heels on.",157720843

My foot is a 9.5 medium width, but I have to buy a 10 shoe, and even had to go with a wide in the Pegasus 33. As far as the Lunar Epic, I couldn't even get my foot all the way in. My heel wouldn't go in. Who is the fit model for adult shoes, a little boy? I will return these, and then it's back to my never-ending search for a shoe brand that works with my feet.

863779,5,04/03/2017,New life to tired feet My favorite running shoe to date. I'm on my feet all day at work so a comfortable cushioned running shoe is a must for me . The heel does not feel as locked in as the lunarepic lows but once you go for your first run that feeling quickly goes away as the shoe has no slippage at all. Nike nailed this one for me extremely happy!,157060607
863779,4,03/30/2017,"Still one of the most comfortable running shoes around! After running with various Flyknit Lunars over the last 4 years it was time to try the new LunarEpic. I am very happy to say that these shoes are continuing the amazing mix of comfort and cushioning that I had with the Lunar. The Flyknit upper still steals the show with being the most comfortable upper material I had in running shoes. It keeps the foot tight but without the feeling of being constricted. The only minor drawback is that the fit is a bit narrow and I had to go 1/2 size up. As for the sole, the Lunarlon still provide a generous amount of cushioning despite a lack of responsiveness, especially in the rear foot. 

To sum up, the LunarEpic are not the responsive racing shoes that can be used in various terrains but if you are looking for very comfortable shoes for daily training and long distance races they are definitely the right shoes!",156515793

863779,4,03/11/2017,"Very nice with minor drawbacks. I've been running in these for almost a month now. Let me start by saying I run exclusively in the Lunarlon series and more exclusively with the Lunar 1's, 3's and now LunarEpic 2's. The cushion feels softer than that of the Lunar 1 or 3's I previously ran in and the flyknit on this shoe seems to be softer than it's predecessors which adds to the comfort. The sock integration into the upper is nice and removes the concern for tongue slippage. The drawbacks for me are the feeling of slippage in the heal which I am not getting more used to. At first it felt like my foot was going to come straight out of the shoe on my runs but this never occurred. I have also toggled with thin and thick running socks to optimize the shoe. Thick sock makes the heal feel like it will have slippage where as a thinner sock feels more locked into the heal. Drawback to the thin sock approach is the toe box feels huge. My foot is a mid-wide for reference. The only other drawback is the design of the tread which is a rock magnet. I grab a noticeable stone on every run. This is rather annoying and bothers me much more than the heal concern. That being said, I would still buy an additional pair of these due to my love of the flyknit material, tongue integration, and over all comfort of the shoe. It is also extremely light. I like the added cushion feel of these over the predecessors however it does feel less responsive than previous models so could hinder some racing times if you plan to run in these. I hope Nike does something to improve the tread on the next model. If the tread did not have the rock issue, I would probably move these to a 5 regardless of my perceived heal issue.",154378163

863779,3,02/13/2017,"NIKE LUNAR EPIC 2 A year ago I bought the first release. Had to return it because the toe box was too snug and tight. I even went half a size to compensate. Anything higher up in size affected my heel to slide within the sneakers.

As for the second iteration, the toe box seems fine, but the width was very narrow. It felt tight and uncomfortable even when I loosened up the laces. I have medium-wide foot, even when I went a half a size up to compensate for my width, though It felt better, it was still uncomfortably snug.

This would've been a great optional running sneaker. It looks really good on. I may still purchase it if Nike still offers that one-month trial to see if the knit fabric loosens up and allows more comfort after a period of (a month's) wear. If it does, I will keep it. If not, I'll return it.

863779,5,02/07/2017,"It only took 2 miles to say yes, Im making the purchase. Currently, I am running in the Lunarepic Flyknit 1. Personally, for the past 4 years Ive enjoyed running in the Flyknits, from racers to Lunars. So I have the confidence to say that I have established a great bond between what Flyknit feels best for what mileage. Typically Ill use the Lunarepics for distances between 5  and 26 miles. Reason being is that they have the strong arch support to withstand the long distance of a marathon, but also with a soft comfortable stride at the same time. What I noticed new about the Lunarepic Flyknit 2 was the durability. Ive taken them on a rigorous test. Up hill, down hill, with incredible stopping power, and without the radiating energy against my feet and ankles which is a plus. They seemed loose at the first half mile, since the opening of the shoe is wider than the first Lunarepic Flyknit, with an attached tongue. Though after the first mile or so the strides became comfortable. I was able to cut corners harder at a faster pace without my feet twisting in place, another plus. I would have to say its similar to a Flyknit Racer, weight wise, with the support for a 5-15 mile run. Picking up more speed than the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 due to the lessened weight, I almost forgot I had them on. Similar to minimal shoe. I would say though, if you want to time your races, this might not be the ideal shoe since it doesnt have the responce as the Lunarepic Flyknit 1, It is lighter in weight. But as a Monday - Friday training shoe, Id run in these all day! May keep a more supportive shoe like the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 for my long run to keep a more accurate, timed race. I havent tested them out for 20 miles yet, but Im sure Ill use them for my next marathon. Personally, I try to enjoy the run rather time one, so theyre perfect for me.  All in all, It doesnt take me long to find out if Im going to keep them or not, love at first run. Id recommend these to everyone!- Perry Wells  Boston runner",150036427

More snug through midfoot, yet very open and breathable in the forefoot. The integrated tongue also makes it easier to get the shoe on and off and less likely to create blisters. I need a stability or structured shoe and previously relied on lunarGlides and Structure shoes from Nike. These offer the same stability in a more comfortable and lightweight feel.

Only reason it's not a 5 is that I think more can be done to secure the heel in place while in stride. There's some subtle slippage when moving at higher speeds.

The weight is outstanding...not clunky, just kind of cuts through the air. 

The sole is the only area I'd like to see improved, which happens to be the same issue I had with the Flyknit 1s. Rocks (pebbles) and other small debris easily gets wedged in between the foam rings.

Ive ran a 4 and a 6 mile run with these and the sock like fit hugs your foot and its supportive yet has lots of cushion. Fit is true to size I would recommend these.,149240381
863779,5,02/01/2017,"Whole new look, same great product I think I've found my new favorite running sneaker. Nike took the lunarepic high and the lunarepic low and combined them in such a way that the lunarepic low 2 was born. If you love the original low top version like I do, then the 2nd iteration will not let you down. The one piece upper's sock like look keeps the shoe snug on your foot with no feeling of potentially slipping out (just like the high top version with the cuff!) At first they feel somewhat tight, but there is a small acclimation period (no more than a day), after which you'll barely notice them on your feet.

As for the cushioning, I've worn them to work (I'm on my feet all day) and experienced little to no foot/shin/knee/quad fatigue whatsoever. I think NIke really has a winner with their lunar pod soles and I think they shoulder incorporate them into more models. 

Running wise, they should easily be an addition to anyone's lineup, from the casual runner to the marathoner. I'm currently training for the NYC Marathon and I couldn't imagine running in anything except for these. I don't know how Nike can improve on this model, but I'm sure they'll knock it out of the park. Will definitely be picking up a few pairs to have on deck. Keep it up Nike!

In other shoes Ive experienced pain with every stride, but today I was able to run pain free and faster, longer than I ever had before. I highly recommend this shoe for people with flat feet, I am elated hat I am able to run once again! The shoe does run tight at first because of the fly kit material.

I've been meaning to upgrade my workout style when I came across these shoes and decided to treat myself. Listen to the Nike size guide people! I was stubborn and didn't pay any mind to their suggested 11.5 size as I know I am an 11. These specific shoes require you to go up in a half size because they fit very snug.

However, once you get the correct size, these shoes are EVERYTHING! They motivated me to go out more and put more time at the gym. It's more comfortable running on the treadmill and doing squats in these shoes. I wear these to work as well and it's maybe because of the fact that I am still breaking in these shoes but I can't provide a definite comment of the support but so far so good. I have noticed that the more I wore these shoes, the more it stretched out so the comfort grew to be amazing! I didn't want to take my shoes off ever lol.

I am just really happy to have purchased these as it has gained me many complements at work and also provides me with motivation to go harder at the gym as it doesn't wear my feet out like my other sneakers. After an hour or two at the gym, my feet still feel fantastic!

However when I started to run on the treadmill, I noticed I was getting viciously shocked everytime I touched the console. I think the way the soles are made there is a lot of friction with the belt. This does not happen with any other shoes that I wear. Unfortunately this means I won't be able to wear these shoes for the main purpose of why I purchased them in the first place.",173557816

I'm a fan of Nike shoes therefore was looking forward to running in these shoes, especially as they had received so many good reviews on here and in the press. However, I am retiring them after a few months of training and running a couple of 10k races in them. Initially they were comfortable and I was happy with them. However, the pain from an old tendon injury to my foot (which I though I had recovered from) has returned, simply because these shoes offer very little support to my foot - it feels like I am running on the side of my foot. Further to this, I am now experiencing calf muscle pain in both legs during my runs and after. I'm now training for a half marathon and the pain is getting worse. The sock design of the Lunarepic simply does not suit me and my advice is if you do or have experience injuries in the past to avoid.

863780,5,09/22/2017,"The best shoes Ive never used Nike for running not until I was introduced to Lunar Flynit 2. And theyre amazing! So stylish, and most important is that theyre comfortable and gives me support especially on long runs. I have 2 pairs already and I would not hesitate to buy another pair. I absolutely love them!",170248495
863780,5,09/21/2017,"Comfortable Being a Personal Trainer, I stand a lot all day, as well as, teach Bootcamp and other GrpX classes, so the sole is more like a court sole for lateral movement, instead of a true running sole. So they are comfortable for standing and working out!",170206871
863780,4,09/17/2017,"First Week I just spent my first week breaking them in, and it feels great so far. 
(I do wear it with a pair of running insoles as well.)

Compared to my previous pair of Nike AirZoom All Out FlyKnit (which the right shoe sole became defective and had to be sent back), it is extremely lightweight and has great support/padding for your feet. 
I no longer feel the sharp pain in my toes that I started to feel with the Nike AirZoom when running beyond 3~4 miles.
Personally, I think there is excessive friction in the heel but is not a huge concern as the socks prevent any type of blistering. I do get a burning sensation when running long distance and it also wears out the socks quickly.
Ankle support would be another point of concern, but nothing serious.

Overall, it wears well and recommend the product for running.",170091398
863780,5,09/17/2017,"These are my favorite long runs shoes! These sneakers are light, but totally supportive for my long runs. I love the sock-light feel around my foot. And they look amazing! Ive run several half marathons in these, and theyre perfect for me.",170091207
863780,5,09/15/2017,"Most comfortable Great shoes. True to size. I am a nike person and since I have been purchasing nike running shoes, these have been the best for me. Much more cushioning and very soft on my feet. Highly recommend these. Try them. You'll love them.",170036853
863780,5,08/30/2017,"Great Shoes! They run a half size small for me since the design does not have a tongue like the first model. I have low arches, so finding comfortable and supportive shoes is hard for me... these are awesome. Lots of cushion.",169631470
863780,5,08/28/2017,"Comfortable I bought these shoes for my fiance because they were extremely comfortable. Great cushioning and ventilation. I wouldnt suggest wearing these in the rain, other than that great shoes.",169544039
863780,5,08/28/2017,Love!! I used these shoes during my track season. The are still in good shape for having them for 4 months and having used them almost daily during the track season and now daily during my tennis season. The shoes get dirty pretty easily but I clean the bottoms of the shoes with a toothbrush with some soap and water to make them appear more white. I love that these shoes don't have the tongue in the shoe because they always seem to annoy me. They are also very comfortable even if you are just walking. The shows also make you look a little taller. Love these shoes so much.,169543874
863780,4,08/16/2017,"Excellent shoes These are great running shoes. I knocked off a star only because the tread picks up a crazy amount of little rocks and even broken glass a few times, creating a princess and the pea type situation when I am walking around. I have gotten used to it though, and now hardly notice it. However, despite the tread, these shoes are incredibly comfortable. They feel like I am slipping on socks instead of shoes, and are incredibly light. I run 4-5 miles five days a week, and I was amazed that these required zero time to break in. I am sure they will get more comfortable the more I wear them. I upgraded to these shoes from the original nike airs, which i have had for years, and i am so glad I did. Within a few days of wearing them to run they have alleviated my shin splints by at least 30%, and I think that is due to the ankle support and arch support for flat feet. Highly recommend, just push past the annoyance that comes from the rocks on the bottom.",168928721
863780,4,08/16/2017,"These shoes saved my knees I recently had knee surgery and getting back into running has been very difficult due to pain and physical limitations.  Since buying these shoes I have found myself running further and with significantly less pain than before, would definitely recommend them if you need more cushion.  The one thing I didnt like about these shoes is the photo didnt reflect the colour.  I bought the White/Pure Platinum/Wolf Grey/White colourway, and in the photo they definitely look a lot more white than they are, I would describe them as quite silvery.  I also did not realize the shoes didnt have a tongue, so if you have wide feet I would be cautious in purchasing.",168864412
863780,5,07/22/2017,"Best shoes ever!!! These are the most comfortable shoes! I decided to buy these in store, and will be purchasing another pair tomorrow! What I love about these shoes is that they fit perfectly to my feet. I have a very long, skinny/narrow foot, so it can be difficult finding shoes that fit well on my feet without making them look huge. Most of the time I get a shoe in my size, and they look huge due to the fact that my feet are long. Then they always tend to be too wide, but I need them to fit the length of my feet. However, these shoes are perfect for people with long narrow feet. If you short (5,5) like me and have big feet then you will love these shoes. I hope Nike never stops making them.",166701598
863780,1,07/17/2017,"No durability I have had these shoes for less than 6 weeks and I dont run, just walk, and the soles are gone from the bottom of the shoes. Im beyond disappointed and will not be buying Nike again.",166376123
863780,3,07/09/2017,"Not Good For Wide Feet I bought these to replace my Nike Lunar Glides and those worked great. I have slightly wider feet but nothing too crazy and a pretty low arch. I really wanted to love this shoe but I could literally feel half my foot off the shoe. 

Besides that, the shoes were comfortable and made your foot feel secure without being too tight. I think these would work great with some with normal width or narrow feet. 

If you have wide or flat feet don't buy!",166019652
863780,5,06/21/2017,Love these shoes! These shoes are a really nice pair of running shoes. Super light for runs. I bought one size up for running for ease of movement. Speedy shipping too!,164281465
863780,3,06/16/2017,Poor ankle stability Usually love Lunars but these did not support my ankles as expected. The bottom is rounded and makes it hard to have a smooth run. Do not recomment for people who experience shin splints or any pain around the high ankle!,163924651
863780,5,06/11/2017,"Disneyland? No problem. These shoes are incredible! Two days in a row, I wrecked my feet with heels, and they hurt so badly. On the third day, these shoes arrived in the mail, and I immediately put them on and wore them to Disneyland, which I was at from 6 P.M. to 2 A.M for Grad Nite. Besides sitting on roller coasters, I was on my feet for all 8 of those hours walking, running, and dancing and my feet never hurt. It was like walking on clouds the entire night. The shoes stretched out and my feet didnt get tired at all due to the amazing support. I bought these shoes a 1/2 size larger and they fit perfectly. They were tight at first, but they expanded quickly. The color I got, green, and shape of the shoe are beautiful, and I got many compliments throughout the night. I highly recommend buying these shoes!",163604770

863780,5,05/28/2017,"Good support Bought this pair in emergency since the other shoes caused me severe calf pain. Couldn't be happier. Look great, stylish, and fit is perfect for narrow width. I bout get size 6.5, my true size. Foundation and support are great and can beat any other brands in the market. Planning to get more in other colors!",162633497
863780,2,05/18/2017,"Not what I expected I loved the Flyknit Lunar 3s but I needed a new pair and I was told that they no longer made those ones and was recommended these shoes. I've been training with them for a little over a month now. The farther I run, the more I've been feeling my feet cramp and my ankles are so so sore. I've never had this problem with a shoe before. I also noticed that my insole shifted and was a major cause of the pain. I'm very surprised that most of the support is at the inner heel and not the outer heal. My race is Saturday and running shoes are so expensive that now I don't know if I should buy a different shoe and chance it, or chance it with these. Major let down.",161840237
863780,5,05/14/2017,"This product was all around very good! Usually Nike impresses me on my purchases, and these did! These may be one of my most comfortable pair of sneakers and I couldnt have been happier in choosing these. They are great for running or training so I highly recommend them!",161514691
863780,5,05/11/2017,"AMAZING after a short break in period I have had these shoes for about a week now and to be honest after the first 20 minutes of wearing them around the house I put them back in the box with the intention to return them because they were just too narrow. 

I then did some research online and saw that the flyknit can be tight at first but that it will stretch. I also remembered that my cherished Pegasus 33s needed a slight break in period, so I decided to give the Lunars another chance. 

I am SOOOO glad that I did that because they just needed to stretch a little. I wore them on a quick 3 mile run and after about a quarter mile I felt like I was running on a couple of clouds! I have since done a couple more runs in them and I find myself leaving them on after my run because they are so comfortable that I don't want to take them off! 

Long story short, if you have really wide feet then sadly, these aren't for you. If you have regular/med wide or narrow feet, these are great, you just might need to wear them a bit to stretch out the flyknit!",161227247
863780,4,04/20/2017,"Decent shoe I've had this shoe for a few weeks and ordered my usual size 11, I wanted something new as I was previously wearing Nike Free RN flyknits and they needed to be replaced. I wanted another flyknit however these seem to be tight in the back of the foot. It almost feels like it's just too narrow in the heel and my foot doesn't fit right - sort of like it could slip out? I'm not sure how to explain it. Sort of like if you've ever worn orthotics or inserts, and it takes up some of the space and just doesn't feel super fitting, like that. I got the lighter grey/white color which is really striking. The shoe is comfortable otherwise. Bouncy and light, just hoping it fits a bit looser with more wear. I didn't have that problem with the Nike Free RNs, but that is all flyknit even up to the ankle. This shoe has lining there.",159090940
863780,1,04/15/2017,Too Narrow on Regular Width Foot I tried these on at a retailer and fell in love. Ordered the color I wanted from Nike.com in the same size but somehow they were a completely different fit than the brand new pair I tried on in a store. I do not understand how that can happen but the pair from Nike.com were extremely narrow. I have never had issues with shoe width before so this was disappointing as the pair I had tried on fit like a glove and I love the sock-like feel that is not offered in any other shoe. I will be returning this shoe without use because it is too narrow.,158512836
863780,5,04/04/2017,Extremely comfortable This shoe is the most comfortable running shoe Ive ever owned. The toe box is perfect to allow my toes to move a little and not become sore on long runs. The bottom is very well cushioned yet the shoe is light. I will be buying another pair!,157185520
863780,4,03/28/2017,"Great Training Shoes I initially purchased these for gym training and light running, plus I've loved the style of the shoe. I gym at least 3 times a week and run about 4 times a week for 15-20 minutes. The shoe itself is very durable, easy to put on because of the flyknit design, comfortable when walking for hours on end, great look for everyday wear, the higher tongue part is great at keeping my ankles snugged in the shoe. I also like the bottom of the shoe which has a higher platform so more cushion, which makes its more comfortable to run in. My feet are medium in length but leaning towards the wider side and this shoe nicely accommodates for that. 

I would say the only downside to wearing these shoes, is that the bottom design makes a loud squishy sounds with every step so it does get annoying if you walk on shiny tiled floors. Carpet and cement is fine when walking.",156156145
863780,1,03/25/2017,Very disappointing These were a huge waste of money. They have caused me endless foot pain. They feel comfortable but the new technology creates instability that wrecked my foot. I thought maybe it was a coincidence until yesterday when my physical therapist said he bought a pair and thinks they are very unstable and could have precipitated my issues.,155925171
863780,5,03/23/2017,"In Love!! These shoes are great, I have a super narrow foot with a really high arch and these shoes give me support and stability when running.

863780,5,03/10/2017,"This shoes is amazing I have always loved the Nike Free 4.0 Flynit, but they have discontineued them. I have tried the Nike Free RN Flynit but it wasn't the same. Then I tried Lunarepic Low Flynit 2 and fell in love with them. I love the sock-like feel and the cushioning on the bottom, my feet don't hurt when I'm running. I think all runners should just try it out for themselves!",154311915
863780,1,03/07/2017,"What happened here??!! I have been waiting over 6 months to find a running shoe that really popped out at me. Stores in my area don't carry new releases for women so I have to shop online. I really thought these were it!!!...but they failed miserably! I cannot believe the cost of these for what they were. I am ALWAYS a size 6 - I have never been any other size but I couldn't even get these on. Also, I have medium width feet, they are not wide but not at all narrow....I felt like I was stuffing a fat foot into these, they were hard to get on and once I did the length was so-so they could have been bigger, they surely did not fit, but the width was crazy tight!! I thought for sure I found my new running shoe, I was so excited to get them, and then this! Shocking!! I can't say for sure how I would have felt if they did fit correctly but I just wasn't wowed. Got them today, sent them back today.",154065960

863780,3,02/28/2017,"Incredibly comfortable upper, disappointing arch support I have some tendon damage and needed something really soft almost sock like (which these are), but with plenty of support under foot. These almost fit the bill, they are incredibly comfortable around my upper foot and ankle, but as soon as I take a step, I can feel a lump which is almost like an arch support which is way too far back and almost under my heel. I'm still tossing up whether to go ahead with my purchase, I love the look of them, so may put up with the 'lump'.",152650680
863780,4,02/26/2017,Narrow I would fully recommend this shoe as long as you do not have wide feet. I bought these for my fiance and they were so narrow she was barely able to get them on. Unfortunately i had to return the pair. I did try the shoes on and they were extremely comfortable to me so i may buy myself a pair and find a wider shoe to buy my fiance.,152522294
863780,5,02/23/2017,"Very comfortable and lovely update Ive got the Lunarepic Flyknit DF & a couple of pairs of the lows. Theyre very comfy, very breathable and they look excellent Im my opinion.  I wasnt a huge fan of the flimsy tongue as they keep sliding.  When I saw these were like a booty I was excited and ordered a pair.Theyre exceptionally comfortable, I think the flyknit is also a little softer on these than the previous version which I quite like & they feel almost sock like.  I normally wear 6.5 in trainers which my other Nike socks are.  As soon as I tried them on I realised theyre a bit wider in the foot, there wasnt a snug feel like the previous model and I noticed some heel slippage.  Having to go back and Ill get a size 6.Size issues aside theyre very comfy, theyre soft & Im loving the booty construction which makes the trainers much better.",152142053
863780,5,02/22/2017,LOVE I have struggled to find a shoe that I love both for lifting and running and I am so happy I purchased these shoes. I run approx. 3 miles a day 5 days a week and have been happy with my runs and the sock feel of the shoe. I am often bothered by how my shoes lace when I run if they feel uneven and this eliminated that feeling. I did however purchase the mens shoe...but I usually love the extra room in the toe box and I just overall like the fit better than a women shoe. I also have high arches and really found these to be a perfect fit. I am also not sure of the durability of the shoe as I have only had them 2 weeks. I highly recommend and may pull the trigger on the white pair although I wish there was an all white pair.,152096115
863780,5,02/22/2017,"Great feel, no complaints The shoe provides a great feel for casual wear or running, though it may feel tight around the top of the foot initially, once broken in it fits more comfortably. overall, it is an outstanding shoe.",152090367
863780,5,02/14/2017,"Comfortable & Cool Design These sneakers are comfortable! They feel cushiony in the sole and hug my feet well; not tight or loose. Ordinarily, I would never buy a white colored shoe because I have big feet and am wary of making them look bigger. However, the shoes look nice on and the white/grey does not make them look out of proportion. I am really happy with them!",150800933
863780,3,02/12/2017,"Cool shoes, not good for running The main thing I look for when purchasing running shoes is cushioning: these seemed to have a soft chunky sole, which to me translated to good cushioning and support but I got disappointed. No support at the arch, not enough cushioning and my feet and ankles are sore after a couple miles. I love the sock fit and the flyknit fabric but I need to look for another pair of running shoes.",150589165
863780,3,02/10/2017,"No Arch Support I have pretty flat arches but this shoe does not have any padding or support where a normal humans foot arches are. The arch support on this shoe is much closer to the heel that it is to where my arches are. There is uncomfortable gap where my arch is and too much padding by the inside part of my heel. If the arch support on this shoe wasn't so far back, it would be a very comfortable running shoe. So, if your arches are small and on the inside part of your heel than I think you will find this shoe very comfortable. The padding and design everywhere else is super nice and I wish this shoe would have worked out for me.",150272335
863780,3,02/08/2017,"A bit too narrow in the midfoot This shoe is definitely light and soft, great for lounging around in, but a bit too narrow for running. I have a wider midfoot which tends to cramp at any distance over 3 miles if the shoes are too narrow. The fabric is flexible so it's not quite as bad in these, but if you need a wider shoe this one probably isn't for you. I got a size 9 and for length they fit true to size. If you have normal or narrow width feet you will probably love these shoes. They are very light given the amount of support they have, especially in the arch. All in all a good shoe I will continue to wear around, just not one that fits my foot structure for running.",150076491
863780,4,02/07/2017,"Good update I'd like to start off by recommending going up a half size. I got a size 8 in these, and will be needing to to get an 8.5. These feel softer than the previous model, which is nice. However, the upper feels much tighter and maybe a little more narrow, which I think is caused by the new bootie fit, which doesn't have a tongue, making it a little less accommodating, but it does make it easy to slip on and off as needed. I'd imagine the durability is the same as the previous model, since it is the same midsole.",150042171
863780,5,02/07/2017,"Running on clouds I fell in love with the new silhouette of the Flyknit Lunarepic 2 from the moment I saw it. 

The new flyknit bootie construction makes the upper one single but comfortable seamless piece. This tightly woven flyknit offers a balanced combo of stretch and support, hugging your foot without suffocating it. This shoe is the opposite of that painful, foot-numbing feeling!

I'm used to wearing snappy and responsive shoes such as the new Zoom Elite 9 (amazing shoes btw!) however, when I slipped these on I couldn't help but think “This must be what running on clouds feels like.” Seriously, they were that comfortable. 

The pressure-mapped pods on the sole offer targeted cushioning for a smooth ride, and the slits on the midsole offer a seamless heel to toe transition. These are definitely my new to-go shoe whenever I'm looking for a softer ride during my runs.",149989915

So far I have taken them on a couple of runs and have done about 10 miles. No discomfort and like the support. I'm definitely a fan and when they come out I will buy another pair.

863780,5,02/01/2017,LOVE LOVE LOVE I am in love with the LunarEpic Flyknit 2. It is truly a new and improved LunarEpic. The sock like fit of the shoe is nice. They are easy to put on and the laces help to give the shoe a secure fit. The shoe is more fitted to the foot than the original LunarEpic and the toe box is a little slimmer. The back of the shoe is softer but still sturdy. They feel just as good on mile one as they do on mile 8. I miss having the tongue on the shoe only because I like to tuck in my laces. The laces are long enough to tuck into the shoe but they do slide out easier. I highly recommend the shoe and suggest that everyone should try the shoe. It is even a great shoe for walkers.,149171119

878670,5,10/29/2017,"Great looking, super-comfy shoe for short runs and daily casual wear Had Zoom All Outs for 11 months so far and, although I'm a club runner/racer, I wear them more for casual and work, especially when traveling so I don't need to carry an extra pair of running shoes in my hand luggage. They are one of the best looking running shoes on the market and by far the most comfortable to wear casually. The rebound is incredible, but my only word of caution is they lack lateral stability on long runs, and I've personally found their comfort deteriorates on runs beyond 10k. I've read some negative comments on here about their durability, but mine have been exceptionally hard wearing: uppers and sole are in tact, no leaks in the midsole. I'm a typical light weight runner and perhaps some people are buying these just for their great looks and comfort, when something else might be more suited to their build and activities. Although these are such good looking shoes I can understand the temptation.",175383127

True to size fit and the tech on the shoe you can feel it propel you forward. The mid strike is great as well. Sadly to say... They arent so great for the road. I guess I struck a pebble or something. Who knows. You cant feel anything but bounce when you run, so I imagine you will not be able to tell when or what caused it until the cool down and the bubble hisses. I got 78mi out of them though. Probably a much better feel, performance, and durability on the track. I plan to cop another pair or two...",170251125

878670,1,07/27/2017,"Not for everyone Look great and are comfortable for casual walking. Tried running in them on a treadmill and regret it. I'm limited to running on a treadmill or grass as I cannot tolerate hard surfaces due to injury but I've been running for over 10 years. Used these on a treadmill last week and I am still paying for it! About half a mile into my run I felt constant ""pressure"" at the ball of my feet as though my socks had a ripple. Stopped, removed my shoes, adjusted my socks (which happened to be just fine) and started up again.About another mile into my run and it felt like I was running on little ""ridges"". Not sure if something happened to the air pockets but i had to stop running by 2 miles due to the discomfort. Woke up the next morning with mild foot pain on the bottom of both feet from the ball forward! I do a lot of daily walking as I am a nurse and 3 days later both my feet are still sore! I have used other Nike AIR shoes and never experienced this. Took these back to the store and returned them. Fortunately Nike has a great return policy. Maybe this was a defective pair. For now i'll stick with my Pegasus and Vomero's as I wait for my foot pain to resolve.",167465258
878670,5,07/25/2017,Incomparable comfort These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn. They are unique in that your feet feel like theyre sitting on little clouds from heaven.

878670,4,07/23/2017,Great Product AAA+++ Love these shoes in the wolf grey platinum. The platinum is a great color because it will not show dirt. People ask me all the time for my new shoes. I will replace every clear Nike shoe with platinum in the future. Easy to clean. Extremely comfortable. I like them better than my 2017 Free Runs,166753086
878670,4,07/18/2017,Very Comfortable Everyday Shoe I bought the Wolf Grey after having purchased the White/Pure Platinum. Both have been excellent shoes for wearing on a daily basis and going for walks around my neighborhood. The 3/4 air bag is excellent for daily wear comfort but I don't know if I would feel the same if I were running in them. The reason for this is that the air bag doesn't feel solid and stable when heel striking (in the times that I have run in them).,166435927
878670,2,06/28/2017,"Comfortable fit, unstable heel On the positive side, the shoe is very comfortable fitting and looks good. However, as a heel striker, I must agree with other reviewers who found the heel to be unstable feeling because of the air zoom cushioning. Nike says it works best when you want to run fast, and that it takes some getting used to, so take that into consideration. I'm not particularly fast, and I returned the product before taking the time to get accustomed to the weird feeling (like your heel could roll off to either side depending on where your weight was balanced upon footstrike.) Lots of people seem to like this shoe, but I'd rather feel more of the actual running surface, as opposed to feeling that I am running on a platform attached to the bottom of my shoe.
For now, I'm sticking to Nike Lunarlon shoes.",164988624
878670,1,06/18/2017,"NOT Durable-Air Pocket Busted I received these shoes as a gift. They look great and fit great but they are not durable at all. Within the first 20 miles the air pocket had busted on my right shoe. The left will bust any time now as it is getting ready to pop. I would like to hear from someone from NIKE to send me a replacement pair. I don't know if i received a faulty pair, or these shoes just suck.

878670,5,06/12/2017,Amazing pair of shoes For years I have worn Air Force 1s and wanted to try something lighter and more breathable. I went into a local shoe store and was shown the zoom all out. They are so comfortable. The sole actually helps to lift your foot whileWalking forward. Im not a runner but as a dad I am constantly walking with our dogs and kids and have recently spent an entire day In NYC with my feet pain free at the end. I would recommend and will be buying another pair soon in a different color.,163657548

878670,5,04/16/2017,Best shoes from nike so far I bought one pair. Then I bought 2 more pairs because they are so comfortable. I also like that the soles are not white so if it gets dirty it will not be noticeable. I will quit buying shoes with white soles from no on. So far these shoes seem to deliver what I needed. Very comfortable everyday shoes. You will need to replace the insoles after a month if you wanna use the shoes barefoot. Everything else is great. I wash them in the washing machine no problem.,158664680
878670,3,04/16/2017,"Not For Everyone I've put about 15k on these so far so this review is about my initial impressions. 

As most others have mentioned, the soles provide little to any stability, if you're a heel striker. It works well if you're running down a hill as the Zoom Air unit allows some flex in how your heel lands but on level ground, your heel wobbles with every strike.

For forefoot strikers, these work. I found the Zoom Air unit to be cushioned and responsive. The soles are less flexible than other running shoes because of the Zoom Air unit and you'll want to tighten your laces to keep them locked to your heels. This might be why the ankle area over compensates with all that material above the heel cup.

The upper mesh material isn't the most breathable but they're light and the inner lining is soft and should reduce friction and help avoid blisters. There is some reinforcement in the toe box to keep the shape up and avoid your big toe ripping through the material like in some of their race shoes. I border on normal to wide width and the lasts on these are more generous than their Flyknit racers and Lunarepic Flyknit, which I find to be too narrow.",158586840
878670,4,04/13/2017,"Great shoes for walking The shoes looked great, they are my go to walking/errand shoes. It provided that cushion that I needed during long walks and prolong standing at work. I don't use them as my running shoes.",158375797
878670,5,03/31/2017,Bought for gym training and post cardio I bought this shoe for mainly weightlifting because i had surgery on my foot and needed something with a cushioned and durable bottom. The shoes does not flex like most running shoes I am used to which is what I like. I like the stiffness of the bottom.,156578639
878670,2,03/24/2017,"AS IF If you have ever tried to step on an air mattress in a swimming pool this is the exact feeling you get with these shoes. They look pretty cool on pics, to run in them is challenging. You feel like you are floating in a Cadillac. Once you stop running and have not wiped out, there is that floating effect again. 

Not for running, maybe ok for walking if you like the feeling of floating.",155792343

878670,1,03/17/2017,"I know why they are on clearance now Seemed like a decent attempt at a shoe and I liked it due to the lower heel to toe offset. If you are an avid runner or looking for a shoe to work out in, avoid this shoe at all costs. Major drawback is how the heel has a tendency to roll.

And I can honestly say that this shoe fits every requirement. I will however warn you that there because of my requirements there are things that others may not like. As many reviewers mentioned before me it does not have an arch - which may give you the feeling of inbalance when getting used to the shoe. I liked that because that is the type of thing bodybuilders needed when lifting heavy ( a flat sole). The second thing that others may not like is that the length of the show runs a little short so you may have order a half size up. I did and even with my wide foot nothing felt constricted.

It's definitely a stiff shoe out of the box, and when I first put it on I thought it was too small, however having worn it for a few days around the house, the fit is perfect, so it takes a few to come into it's own, and that is where it becomes so unique. The lockdown around the flywire and lace area is incredible; I prefer a training shoe to be snug and have no movement anywhere other than a tiny amount in the toe area (though this model seems to be a bit tighter in that area compared to the 33) so this is perfect for that. The 'zoom' aspect of this shoe is also much improved compared to last year, and I feel a much better response around the ball of my foot.

Prior to the model 34 Nike used what I would describe as oval profile laces which were wonderful, on the 34's they switched to a flat style shoe lace which came untied three times on my first wearing and have come untied multiple times since. The shoes are extremely comfortable and I would recommend them highly but I sincerely hope that Nike will go back to the previous models oval laces.

A majority of the time I run on concrete or pavement, so I wanted something with a little more support. The Pegasus 34 is a great looking sneaker, that's the reason for the 2 star rating. My first run was on a treadmill for about 4 miles it felt like I was running on feathers. My first run on pavement was not as good, it felt like I was running barefoot I could barely get through a mile. Back to the Lunar Glide 8 for me.",170372107
880555,5,09/21/2017,"Fresh, Fast and Focused The Pegasus keeps getting younger with age. With a sleeker and and more minimal aesthetic I think it's the best looking Pegasus to date. I also appreciate how Nike released it in the Ice Blue and Bright Crimson color to coincide with the Breaking 2 Marathon narrative. The fit of the shoe feels more focused with a snug heel and wide enough toe box to flex and splay toes. 
Best of all is the addition of zoom air to the forefoot that you immediately feel as you start to pick up the pace. For an everyday mileage shoe it's great to have a shoe that makes you feel fast every run. Durability is also great with the outsole having enough traction for unpaved roads, wet streets and everything between.",170207854

880555,2,09/02/2017,"Not for Everyone I ordered the Pegasus earlier this month because I saw many good reviews on the Nike website and other sources online. I tried them on, but the moment I started running, I started to feel a bump on the forefoot every step I took. It caused me a bit of pain because I wasn't used to the Zoom Air technology. Yes, it does help you run faster, but I would rather take comfort over having a bump in the forefoot that increases your running speed. I tried to ignore the bump, but I just couldn't. I returned this earlier today because I felt like this wasn't the shoe for me, and ordered another running shoe that didn't have the Zoom Air technology. I would only recommend it to people who really want to run faster, and don't really care about feeling an awkward bump on the forefoot.

Now that I want to order my Orange they took the color away from the shoe and offer it on most other shoes in their lineup.

The Pegasus 34 is a very breathable shoe, that has incredible lockdown due to the flywire technology. I had absolutely no heal slippage while running, so no need to tie my shoes in a certain way. The traction on this shoe was good for any surface, but tiny rocks and other debris has gotten in between the groves, but that is definitely not a permanent or a big problem.

In the beginning, I loved the feel of the shoe with the overall weight of the shoe and how springy the shoe felt. I haven't worn a pair of Pegasus since the 31's. However, I started to feel a pain in my midfoot area. I tried to attribute this in the beginning to a new shoe. Once the pain began to transfer (because I am sure that I am compensating for the pain) to my knee area, I had to stop wearing them although and start wearing a Lunarglide to ease some of the pain. 

I really want to love this shoe and not sure if it was something with the shoe or me. The last gait analysis that I had done prior to purchasing the shoe didn't show me overpronating so I am not sure what is the answer.",167640765

The only downside is that there feels as if the zoom units in the forefoot midsole are slightly loose as there is a slightly odd feeling under both feet but not uncomfortable. I do quite a lot of running, currently averaging over 70 miles a week so the biggest frustration i have is the durability, the outsole shows quite a lot of wear on the forefoot after only 250 miles and from previous experience with the 33s the midsole will be done for at about 450 miles. Costing me a fortune !!",165849917
880555,5,07/07/2017,"Greatest durability ever Nike classic Pegasus range throughout all the yearly reincarnations have never failed to provide the cushioning and lightness I need for long distance regular running sessions (5k 3/5x week). Amazing durability I have been unable to get from other models, stability of the shoe ensures you will not roll on the ankle & the sole/inner sole has a memory foam feel which is extremely comfortable. Forefront of the shoe allows for toe movement and breath ability

All in all for me, greatest running shoe I've ever owned and will never change, purchase 2/3 pairs yearly (for different colours/not durability issues) and my 28/29/32 are still in mint condition even after minimum of 200K+ mileage each",165711644
880555,5,06/30/2017,"Great marathon training and racing shoe This is a comfortable, light, and fast shoe that is perfect for distance training and racing. I'm really happy with how it lets me feel the road and avoid injuries. One thing to be aware of is where the shoe is manufactured (printed under the tongue) matters. I first tried the -001 style (black/white) shoe that is manufactured in China and almost bought it but it had a little too much forefoot movement for me. Then I tried on the -007 (grey/blue/white) and instantly knew that was the one. It's manufactured in Vietnam. I'm sure the soles and structure of the shoe are identical (they seem to be), but the uppers vary by country and that makes its feel like a different shoe. So, try before you buy, but after about 100 miles or so in it I'm expecting I'll get another pair before my race later this year. The one minor improvement I'd like to see is a smoother fabric inside the heal that doesn't pill.",165120669

The recommendation landed on the Air Zoom Pegasus 34's so I placed an order figuring if they didn't work out I could try a different design under Nike's return policy. 

From the first run I could tell I'd landed on the perfect shoe for me, they're supportive while not being overly bulky, the dual Zoom units in the midsole and forefoot provide responsiveness and great foot control and the upper mesh is breathable. 

They fit true to size for me, the toe box is spacious and the width was normal as well. I don't like the instability that overly soft shoes have so these were a perfect fit and don't have that marshmallowy plushness that some other Nike foams have, however they are still very comfortable on long runs. 

I ordered these for performance however this is a great looking shoe that I get compliments on constantly. Overall they are a great shoe for me, my only wish is they had an upper a little more open knitted like the Flyknit Racers.",164584859

880555,3,06/21/2017,"Comfortable update with one major exception I purchased these as I have been happy with several other iterations of the Pegasus series and hadn't purchased a pair since the 32's (which i still love).
Overall the shoe is stylish and very comfortable although it feels and looks wide even though I ordered a half size down. Aside from the width the rest of the shoe fits true to size. 
The major complaint I have, and the reason I'll be returning the shoe, is that the Air units in the forefoot are definitely noticeable, per other comments on the lumpy feeling, and in my case unevenly pressurized. The unit on the right is at a higher pressure and therefore larger than one the left and after just 2 runs and a couple walks I was noticing joint pressure on the right side which became uncomfortable. 
I really looked forward to these and like the new styles (the Solstice is great) but didn't want to risk further injury by having to compensate with an uneven gate on one foot vs. the other.",164262435

Why? because this shoes has all the features just like all in one running shoes every features are included, good cushioning, good bouncing, good fit and light weight , but this shoes not master in any feature! 
-They are soft&cushioning? Yes, but Vomero 12 & Lunarepic 2 are softer. 
-They are light weight? Yes, but but Flyknit Racer & Zoom Streak are much lighter. 
-They are fit on the foot? Yes, but Nike Free RN Motion Flyknit 2017 are much better fit and wrap around your foot better too.
Anyway Nike Zoom Vomero, Lunarepic , Free RN Motion Fryknit and other not included all the feature of each other. 
So if you looking for The All-in-One shoes I suggest you The Pegasus 34 that included all necessary feature with reasonable prize.",164043732

Not much has changed other than some improved breathability. For some reason the shoe just feels just a tiny bit larger than the 33. Maybe they changed the inside cushioning of the shoe slightly?

Some minor annoyances are that the Black / Dark Gray sold on Nike actually has a lot of blue in it which doesn't look that great. The new flat laces also come untied very easily during my runs.",163376519

I ran a bit in the Pegasus 33's last year and was happy with those so, when I saw these were available, I decided to give them a try. I went for my first run in them today and barely made it to mile 3 before I had to stop and give my feet a break. These shoes are unbelievably narrow. I pushed through the rest of my run, but it was one of the worst ones that I've ever had. I'm back home and have taken the shoes off, but my feet are incredibly sore and I have a blister on the back of my foot (heel cup is too narrow and pinches). The length of the shoe was good and felt true to size, but be aware of the narrow width. Thankfully, Nike has a good return policy and, hopefully, I'll have better luck with the Vomero.",163033766
880555,5,05/31/2017,BEST YET I have been strictly running in Pegasus shoes since the Peg 30's. I didnt think the shoe could improve from the 33's besides the laces but they have. The added breathability in the upper is very noticeable. The new laces stay tied all the way through any distance compared to the circular laces that were always in need of adjustment. The larger check always makes the shoe look better. Also the balance from heel to toe feels absolutely centered and controlled all the way through each step. The price point for the quality is outstanding as well.,162855054
880555,1,05/27/2017,"Worst update since the 31 I will start by saying I have been running in Nike Air Pegasus for several years and have owned multiple pair of each version since the 27. I thought the Pegasus 31 was the worst version, until I bought the 34 this week. This shoe has absolutely no spring or give anywhere in the foot. I literally feel like I have a 2x4 strapped to my feet when I run. It also feels extremely stiff and heavy compared to previous versions. I ran 35 miles in them this week, and finally gave up. Lucky for me Nike has a good return policy and took them back no questions asked. If you like a light springy shoe that makes you run fast, this shoe is not for you. If you want a stiff, bulky, heavy, slappy and slow shoe that feels like a board tied to your feet....buy these",162557233
880555,5,05/26/2017,"Zoom Pegasus 34 After picking up my first pair of Pegasus' last year, I was excited to buy this new model. It doesn't disappoint. 
Upper - The new fly mesh material is noticeably more breathable and flexible than the previous years more stiff and thick mesh.
Design - The addition of reflective elements on each swoosh is nice if you like running at night. Additionally, I enjoy the change of the new reflective element on the heal. Speaking of the heal, the lock down in the heal is quite a bit better than last year. I feel as if the hard heal cup wont cave in or become altered in shape over time. One of my favorite changes is in the mid foot. The material used around the laces locks down the foot with help of the fly wire and the new flat laces opposed to last year's round laces do a lot better job staying tied and locked down to your foot.
Sole - The zoom units in both the heal and forefoot are noticeably responsive. Hopefully the will not become flat as I add more and more miles onto the shoe. When you are walking you will notice the unit in the heal and if you forefoot strike the zoom unit will be very useful to you. Lastly, they kept the same outsole as last year and I have found the rubber to be very durable and grippy for most all surfaces.
Overall Opinion - This shoe is a great upgrade from last year and I expect to get at least 400 miles in these before I need to get a new pair. These will be good for long slow runs as well as tempo runs and possibly some speed on the track. I would definitely recommend.",162422248

880560,3,11/21/2017,"Didn't live up to my exceptions The overwhelming hype for this shoe from every runner friend I have was what actually got me to buy a pair of the Pegasus 34. The delivery was fast and once I opened the box, I was so excited because the color (Ice blue) and the design of the shoe made these one of the prettiest pair of running shoes I owned. And once I put them on, right away I felt the comfort and flexibility that everybody was talking about. However, on the left shoe I started to feel a small and hard bump in the forefoot area. It was somewhere in the middle of the forefoot, at the base of the 2nd toe. I thought it was just going to be temporary and the cushion would wear down after a few runs, but unfortunately that didn't happen. I ran about 30 miles (about 2 weeks) in these shoes and while everything except the left forefoot was SO comfortable, I couldn't help but focus my mind on the small bump during my whole run. So I gave up trying to break them in. And you must be thinking 'What if it was only that pair that was defective?'. Yeah, I thought that, too. I wish that was true because I wanted this to be my running shoe soo bad. So I went to the Nike store and I tried other colors, a size up, a size down... no luck, every single pair bothered me in the forefoot area. Now I don't know if it's just my foot, or if it's Nike and anybody else has had this issue, but if you do, then at least you won't think you're the only one when you see this review. I've been faithful to Nike for years and I've never had this bump problem until now. I really hope the next version fixes this issue because the Pegasus seem really comfortable to run in and also very good looking.",176232140

I was excited to see one other than black!) After wearing them once, I knew they had to be returned. They were way, way too narrow for me.

While I do run during my exercise sessions, I needed something that provided shock absorption during high intensity cardio classes & combat workouts as I suffer greatly with pain in my knees & legs.

I've now ordered a second pair in a different colour!",169083108

I have trained in Nike air pegasus', mostly the 31's, for the past five years and loved them. However the Pegasus 34's are very uncomfortable while running in. The Zoom Air pockets in the fore foot have caused me to shorten my stride and make running uncomfortable. The 34's are very comfortable while standing and walking round in, but are simply uncomfortable while running in. The Air Zoom pockets in the fore foot were a great idea on paper but missed the mark in the field. Unfortunately I will be switching to another shoe brand for a while. I truly loved the Nike air pegasus before the recent addition of Zoom Air unit in the fore foot.",168011948

I have extremely flat feet and terrible ankles (I'm 2 surgeries into my left ankle and I'm only 23), but this shoe is like running on clouds. I find them a little bulky to say they're ""cute"" but they are much more attractive than other brand's runners. 
I find them very comfortable and I keep returning to rebuy them. I had the 32's but they wore out within 9 months. I do find that the structure of them does wear out and they need to be replaced, but if you're running a lot, you should replace shoes every 6 months to a year anyway.

Bonus is that they look nice too.",173743151

They offer moderate support (the stock insole is garbage) and a nice ride. It's been a long time since I've used an Air shoe and they are more comfortable than I remember. I get good traction on dirt and gravel trails thanks to the rugged outsole. After a month of using these I think I would have preferred an extra half size. I'd try your typical size plus the next half up to get the right fit.",170699813

The trail tread provide terrific grip on gym floors (including carpet), concrete, and off-road. My workouts are 70% resistance training, and the Terra Kiger 4 performs well across the board. Lateral support is minimal, however that is common for most running shoes. My only critique is the tongue; it ends right past the laces, and an extra half inch would go a long way. Great shoe all around!",169340882
880563,3,08/11/2017,"Great Trail Shoe - Just Coming Apart Love this shoe. Put about 90 miles on it before running a 30K trail race. The trail race was a tough test for a shoe, and the Kiger performed wonderfully. Great footing, great feel, great traction. 

I like to keep the laces loose on all my shoes, so I'm not sure if that added extra stress to the part of the shoe that's getting torn apart. And the part that's tearing is only on one shoe, not the other, so it might just be a fluke.",168503517
880563,5,07/26/2017,"Best version of the Kiger Having run now in all 4 versions I would say this is the best. Perfect for our area as you can go from pavement to crusher fine to dirt (open space trails) to mountain single track with plenty of cushioning and protection. More responsive and actually feels lighter than Kiger 3 even though it's 1 ounce heavier. The slipper like feel keeps the pressure off the mid foot and adds to its comfort as the previous burrito wrap and flywire added too much tension for my comfort. I'm 6'1"" and 172 lbs., medium build so the shoe is plenty for my body type (it is a low volume shoe). This is a great all around trail shoe for a wide variety of surfaces and I would highly recommend this shoe.",166963855
880563,2,07/24/2017,"Felt great but fell apart I have had these shoes for 3 1/2 months and have only run in them about 2x per week, mostly on trails in the mountains where I live. Nothing too vigorous and, obviously, not frequent enough to cause more than minimal to moderate wear and tear. Yesterday a large piece of the outsole ripped off on the left inside forefoot. My brother-in-law had a similar thing happen with his older versions. Other than this, I absolutely love the shoe, but I can't deal with this type of durability issue. Will not be purchasing again and will not be recommending.",166834128
880563,5,07/21/2017,"Great, just like the Kiger 3 I've only had the TK4s for about 2 weeks and have done two long trail runs. I also own the previous generation - the TK3s. And I love those. 

The trails I do have a lot of knee-height brush and there's lots of stuff that will usually get stuck to my shoes, socks, and legs - all kinds of spike balls, sharp grass tips, etc. 

On these trails, a lot of things would get stuck into the mesh exterior and flywire of the TK3s. That problem seems to be much reduced on the Kiger 4. The flywire is now better protected and the mesh above it keeps debris out. 

The only downside to the TK4 compared to the TK3 is a tighter toe box. It seems the shoe is not quite as tall in the front as the TK3. Visually it looks the same, but they feel different. My toes feel more snug in the TK4 and on long runs it can feel a bit tight.",166651132
880563,5,07/06/2017,"Great shoe! A friend told me he liked this shoe, so I ordered it from Nike.com. I originally ordered a 9. It was really tight, so I sent them back and got a 9.5. These shoes are great. I haven't tried them yet on a trail. They work really well on the street as well as the treadmill. Great shoe. One sort of odd thing. I use them at the gym for Cardio as well as working out. When I do a body plank and have to be on my toes with these shoes, they are really uncomfortable for that. Not sure why that is, but hmm. Great shoe overall, though!",165676358
880563,5,06/26/2017,"Amazing Trail Shoe I don't usually leave reviews for shoes because I believe shoes and how they fit are truly unique to each runner/athlete. However, I have to say, the Kiger 4 are possibly the best running shoe I've ever used (road and trail). 4mm drop, relatively wide toe box, great rock plate, enough stability yet responsive and great ground feel without being too stiff. I'm training for a 50k trail race and have no doubt these shoes will take me that distance.",164574705

Just got them so I can't rate them for durability yet. Sizing... It's been some time since I have bought Nike shoes.. I typically wear a 10.5M in all quality dress shoes, and an 11M or 11EE in this type of sports shoe. According to the trufit on the site, I should have ordered a 12 in this shoe, but an 11.5 is perfect. Highly recommended!",163121866
880563,5,05/23/2017,"Great fit and awesome performance! Bought these shoes with a bit of hesitation, as I've never worn Nike trail shoes. Out of the box they felt fantastic on my feet and aided me in a successful 50k after just two shorter test runs. As far as sizing I'd say I'd go up a half size next time to give my toes a little more room in the toe box. On steep downhills my feet slide forward a bit, coming into contact with the toe box. Nike gets two thumbs up from me on these. Can't wait to see them take me to the 50m and 100k distance this summer!",162238994
880563,5,05/20/2017,"Great Fit Just bought these today and was really pleased with the fit. They are a bit softer than the Wildhorse but still give your foot plenty of control and stabilization.

880564,5,09/14/2017,"LOVE This Shoe! Don't Change a Thing!! I'm an experienced trail/ultra runner accustomed to running in zero-drop (equal heel-forefoot height) shoes. I got these because I had a slight ache in my Achilles' tendon after a hard training week, and thought the slight (not too aggressive) heel lift of 4mm would ease tension on my tendon. 

I was surprised and amazed at how comfortable these are. The ankle/midfoot fit is secure and sock-like, while the toe box has a wide enough flare to avoid blisters. The toe box is shallower than some trail shoes, but the material is forgiving enough that it doesn't bruise the toenails. At least not up to 15 miles; I'm yet to race further in them, but plan to try them out for my next 50k.

The cushioning is amazing, responsive on hard trails and road sections, and forgiving on rocky, rutted singletrack. The shoe feels nimble and light when hopping along the trails, and I think it'll do pretty well in mud too.

The pink color is adorable. I'm so used to running in dark grey/black ""tanks"" that it's a really refreshing change to have trail shoes that are cute as well as functional and FAST.

Please keep making this shoe. It's a phenomenal racer/trainer for those who like to strengthen their ankles/feet and really feel quick on the trails.",169993691
880564,5,08/27/2017,"My Third Pair This is my third pair of Terra Kigers, and I love them!!

I read the previous review, and as soon as the reviewer mentioned using trail shoes on a treadmill, I knew that it would be bad news! DO NOT WEAR THESE ON A TREADMILL. DO NOT WEAR THESE TO THE GYM. They are trail running shoes for a reason!! I learned this the hard way too!! I learned to buy a pair of Nike Frees for the gym specifically because polyurethane treadmills wear down your shoes because of all the friction! Also I realized that it's terrible to be that person bringing in dirt and pebbles in from the trail. My bad.

Why I love this shoe:
I've run (trail) marathons in these bad boys... and even hiked Mt. Whitney (22 whole miles to 14,500 ft) in these twice because I hate wearing hiking boots. No, they do not provide that much ankle support, so maybe it's not the best hiking shoe for older people, buttttt it works for me! 

Whether I am trudging through mud a tropical forest in Hawaii/Thailand or stomping through snow in Tahoe or Norway, I know I can rely on these shoes! They dry fairly quickly, so even if you get wet, you will be okay. I personally don't like GoreTex shoes because if you do get wet on the inside of your shoes, then it's trapped!

Comparison:
I've owned Adidas and North Face trail running shoes, but keep going back to these. Adidas trail runners do not seem to have enough grip for me (I like my trail runs a little muddy), and North Face trail running shoes are simply too narrow for me since my feet are on the wider end (I have bunions). I have tried other brands in stores, but the flexibility of the shoe given the tread is the best for me.",169518023
880564,2,08/15/2017,"Major Wear and Tear I walk my dogs on a pea-gravel trail 2 miles max per day during the week and walk a treadmill 1.5 miles per day on weekend. I've only had these shoes for a month and a half of wear time. For a pair of shoes that has a max of 120 miles on them I would expect them to be in pretty good shape. The ""cleats"" on the outside bottom of these shoes are already worn smooth and there is already a crack starting where the ball of my foot rolls. This is to be expected in shoes, I get that, but for shoes that are supposed to be of a higher quality, I wouldn't expect this to happen so quickly. I'm very disappointed in these, which is such a shame because they're the only pair of shoes I've found comfortable enough to walk these outdoor trails.",168718507
880565,3,10/20/2017,"Preferred the Wildhorse 3 I absolutely loved the Wildhorse 3--best shoes I've ever ran in. They also happened to be a very good looking shoe (slightly retro). Once they wore out I wanted to get another pair but couldn't find them in my size, so I decided to try the Wildhorse 4. Overall they are somewhat similar, but I don't like the fit as much on the new shoes. Specifically these shoes rub my ankles and there is a seam that rubs the inside of my arch. The 3 also seemed to have a slightly wider and squared-off toe box which felt more natural compared to the narrower 4. Overall they are still a pretty good shoe that I use for hiking, running, casual wear, and general gym use.",173826602
880565,5,09/16/2017,"All-round Shoe I love these shoes! Not only because they're great on trails, but also because they perform really well in whatever activity I'm doing.

880565,2,09/06/2017,"Great Comfort and Support, BAD Durability! I got these for a gift and really love this shoe, it was so comfortable and supportive right out of the box...but, they have not held up at all to say the least. I did 10+ miles and over 4000' of run, hike, scramble for their first use and had no issues with anything. Now, not even 2 months in and the toe caps on both shoes have completely separated from the uppers, with holes now starting to appear. I want to recommend these bad boys, but the durability has been an epic let down.",169797143

I live on an island with varying terrain. These are lightweight sturdy shoes and are great for light to moderate grade trail running. I would recommend something a bit more heavy duty with more ankle support for steap and rocky terrain. But for your every day trail, these are great. My only caviet would be they have no traction on slick wet surfaces, so be careful on wet bridges and wet concrete.",166833998

880565,5,07/09/2017,Great for hiking/trail running I run in the evening around my home and wear a different shoe for that. Bought this one for hiking and light trail running. Perfect fit and comfort and seems to have a lot of support and protection for tougher terrain.,165986689
880565,4,05/25/2017,"the Goldilocks Shoe The Wildhorse 3 was about as good as an everyday, high mileage trainer gets for me. The fit, performance, durability, and price made the shoe arguably the best value going for my needs. Version 3 yielded over 600 miles a pair, which given the terrain I run is exceptional. The fit is excellent for a medium to medium-wide foot. The midsole provides wonderful cushioning for those who don't need/want a maximal shoe, while groundfeel is decent given the levels of comfort and rock plate-aided protection. There are certainly lighter, more responsive, technically capable shoes out there, but no shoe manages to balance the attributes mentioned above in the way the Wildhorse does.

Version 4 appears to have addressed a problem with midfoot security that I didn't personally experience with V3, but the fix fortunately hasn't hampered the fit/performance for my particular foot. I will say that I don't actually find the revised flywire system especially effective if you're looking for greater levels of midfoot lock-down. 

My real complaint with V4, unfortunately, is durability With roughly 225 miles in V4 I've sheared a lug or two clean off (exposing the rock plate), and have otherwise experienced extreme lug wear compared to previous versions. Disappointing, to say the least. I've had such great experience with Wildhorses that I'd likely still recommend them, with the caveat to watch the outsole carefully for durability issues.",162415347
880565,5,05/24/2017,"Great hiking shoes I wear Wildhorses as hiking shoes rather than trail runners, and they perform fantastically. I started with the Wildhorse 1, and enjoyed it but they ran small and the sole seemed to lack some durability. The 3 and 4 still run small compared to all other Nike's I wear, but they do seem to have improved durability. Even hiking the unforgivingly rocky desert terrain around Arizona (including granite that wrecks every part of a shoe), they held up well. So far I have hiked approximately 50 miles of shoe-shredding desert trails and the 4s are almost unscathed. I suspect if you wear these on a stereotypical forest trail they will hold up for quite a while.

I just completed hiking the Grand Canyon, Rim to Rim, in one day wearing my Wildhorse 4s. My feet are pretty much the only part of my body that do not ache in any way. I got a small blister on the side of my big toe that I only noticed after taking my shoes off. As far as cushion and protection from the jutting rocks, these performed fantastically. My feet never fatigued or felt any discomfort. 

As compared to the Wildhorse 3s, the biggest change is the fixed strap over the midfoot. It did not affect fit for me, and did help my feet feel more snug. Also, the tongue is stuck in place giving this shoe more of a sock-like fit as on some of the flyknit shoes. I appreciate one less thing to have moving around. 

The one caveat is that I find the Wildhorses, as a product line, to run about 1 size small. Since age 16 I have worn a size 14 in every Nike product I have tried, which is primarily running shoes. In Wildhorses a 14 leaves my feet cramped so I have to go up to a 15. 

Great shoes, highly recommend.",162285382
880565,5,05/17/2017,Added Stability I've bounced back and forth between the kiger and the wildhorse over the years depending on the model. I really like the new lacing/forefoot overlap construction. It gives the shoe the added stability that is needed on rough trails and adds to the overall durability of the shoe (from what i am able to tell so far). I think it is a big improvement. The sole is pretty much the same if not exactly the same as previous models. Comfortable and aggressive enough to handle any trail. Great shoe overall.,161765238
880565,4,05/16/2017,"Wildhorse 3 vs. Wildhorse 4 I've been running in these since the first version of the Wildhorse. I loved version 1 and 3. I believe I've owned 6 pairs across the difference versions. The new version 4 is very similar to 3 except for one critical difference for a foot with a higher instep like mine. The new stretch spacer mesh over the the top of shoe makes it too tight and constricting without a way to relieve any of the pressure on the top of the foot (i.e. just loosing your laces a little bit). A great shoe very similar to version 3, but just be aware of the subtle changes. The tongue is now attached into more of a sock like fit, but i think it's still loose enough that this isn't contributing to the problem in my case. Hopefully (for me) they alter it a bit next time again. The attached tongue is one of the things that's kept me from being able to wear the Terra Kiger in the past though. Happy trail running, I hope these work for you.",161652129
880566,5,08/01/2017,"Love This Shoe! This shoe has been awesome for hiking. I've worn them on some pretty tough terrain, and they've given me great arch and ankle support. They're also super comfortable. The cushion on the tongue and heel are great. They're light and my feet have not gotten hot in them, despite the hot California sun. Bonus, I really like the look of the shoe. I went with the black, gray and volt. 

I sometimes wear a 6.5 and sometimes wear a 7 in Nikes, and 7 was the right size for me for this one. Sometimes Nikes are too narrow on my foot, but this shoe's width works well for me.",167730892
880839,4,10/12/2017,"Just Do It I hated these shoes when I first got them. Fives miles in to my run, I felt like Nike had invented new ways for my body to feel pain. During my next run I didn't feel any unusual pain and they've been great since.

The Nike Free 5.0s were such a huge fashion statement that has influenced a lot of brands. Everyone keeps talking about comfort, and the 5.0s were comfortable, but that combined with how they performed is the most important aspect of their success. In contrast, I think Free RN 2017 has more flexibility and more structure. They still give you a very natural running experience and look great off the trail. Certain things about the materials and the name changes are a little off but they'll carry you where you want to go. The only bad thing about this shoe is that it won't live up to Free 5.0 standards because its just a different shoe, but the performance is still there.",173535477
880839,2,09/04/2017,Nice looking shoe but... My issue with this product is the material used for the sole. It is snow white and nice looking but the rubber stained immediately and cannot be cleaned.

880839,1,08/24/2017,"Worst Nike Free shoe ever I've been using Nike Free running shoes for a number of years now. The 5.0+ and 5.0 line were far and away the best running shoes I've ever owned and run in. Comfortable, good fit, lightweight, extremely durable. I could easily get up to 600 miles trail/road running per pair of shoes before they were completely wiped and relegated to yard work shoes. 

But these...these were the worst pair of running shoes I've ever owned. The cushioning on the outsole just feels off and the soles themselves started peeling off within a couple of months and 150-200 miles of running under the same conditions as previous Free lines of shoes.

I bought these ones in June 2017 primarily to workout in. They have never been outside and I already have to buy a new pair to work out in. They no longer support my feet which is a disappointment. They also stretched out a ton making it difficult to wear when working out. Definitely would not recommend to someone who is planning on using them specifically to work out in.,169302921
880839,1,08/11/2017,"Very Poor Quality Within the last week I purchased these Nike Free RN 2017s for my son and during the second time he wore them, the fabric ripped by the small toe. I had to sew the hole together and, needless to say, we are both terribly disappointed in the quality of these shoes especially considering the amount of money I paid for them. In the past, we have always purchased Nike and have never had a shoe break down in such a short period so we will now be considering other options when purchasing athletic shoes. It appears quality is no longer held in high regard at Nike!!!",168552659
880839,4,08/10/2017,"A little confused Been using the Free RN's for 5 years now each new model usually offers pretty consistent improvements to the overall shoe design. After using the Free RN's for 5 years I would recommend them as a good starting shoe for people who want to get into running. I recently switched to the Free RN Distance 2 a few months ago and have found them to be a far better shoe. However, for some unknown reason, the Men's version is no longer available on the Nike website, but can still be purchased from outside retailers. If this was not the case I would recommend the Free RN Distance 2 over the standard Free RN as I have found that it offers slightly more cushion and support. Still confused as to why Nike no longer has the men's version on their website.",168499685
880839,1,07/15/2017,"what happened, Nike? There are so many things wrong w/this shoe, they aren't even worth buying on sale. Returning immediately for the following reasons:

-fit is too narrow, toes are cramped on the side and as others have said, you foot feels like its going over the sides...I didn't have this problem in the same size w/free run's in the past 
-sharp spots under the tongue where it is stitched to the upper..u can actually feel sharp nylon bits sticking out..your skin will get scratched up if u dare to wear these barefoot 
-insole is loose and moves easily in the shoe
 -build quality, at least for the black/white color (made in Indonesia), is significantly worse than China or even Vietnam-- glue spots on the upper/laces, damaged laces, rubber outsole parts glued at different heights, just a total lack of attention to detail",166328092
880839,5,07/15/2017,"A welcome return to comfort! I own a set of Free 5.0's (2015) that were my favorite running shoes. Comfortable, durable, lightweight, and flexible sole. Unfortunately, last year's edition of the Free RN (2016) was a disappointment: tighter fit, narrow toe box, overall feel and fit. I ended up passing on those and kept running in the 5.0's. Thankfully, the 2017 Free RN is a welcome return to the design of the 2015 release. Wider toe and a more snug fit. Improved tongue and support in the heel. Flexible sole with more cushion to help with impact absorption. Hopefully, future versions of the Free RN's will stay consistent with this design.",166324090

So I order a pair and they came a week later, no problem. I order a size larger than what I had already outgrew to find the new pair was actually smaller than my old pair. Now, were they broke in? No. But it was very uncomfortable and my foot was coming over the sides. I know new shoes are snug, but nothing like this. i went into a local retailer to just try a bigger size. It worked - expect there was an inch of shoe infront of my toes...",166212897

I haven't used the shoes very much at all, so surprised that pieces would be falling off. Disappointed.",162943265
880839,4,05/24/2017,"Lightweight Comfort, Like Snug Slippers I don't run, so I'm not bothered by the additional cushioning compared to older models. I wear these (maroon pair) with jeans, and I wear them when I have a decent amount of walking to do. 

The fit is on the money, so don't upsize or downsize. If this helps, I'm a 10.5, I wear 10 in Jordan 1's and 11 in foamposites. For these, 10.5 works out perfectly. They match the size of the Airmax Plus and most Nike running shoes.

They're super light and very comfortable, but they haze no arch whatsoever. The idea behind the Free line is to do no more than strap a flat sole to your foot, like the Taramahura Indians strap pieces of old car tire to their feet as running shoes. Barefoot running for people who don't want to run barefoot.",162329521
880839,5,05/22/2017,Very comfortable I purchased a shoe on the recommendation to use for walking for exercise as I am recovering from surgery and can no longer run. I walk up to 5 miles a day and the shoes are extremely comfortable for walking. I am planning on purchasing another pair soon in a different color. I cannot comment on durability is an only had them for a month or so. At this point they do seem to be holding up well.,162119215
880839,2,05/18/2017,"Good Lifestyle shoe, not good running shoe I bought a pair of these to replace my old nike free 5.0's, since the change I've found the cushion is way too much on the free rn's and it changes the way you have to run (not for the better). 

Safe to say I use these purely for the gym and have got my old 5.0's back out.

Comfort is great but for running you need technique there as well.",161839772
880839,5,05/16/2017,"Excellent mid-tier comfort shoe I bought these for my boyfriend as a present for his birthday. He has owned about 3 or 4 pairs of Nike Free Runs prior to this pair, with each lasting him about a year before they begin to fall apart at along the bottom seam connecting the fabric to the white cushion. He mentions that they are a fantastic shoe for walking and wearing to work every day - they provide substantial comfort and are incredibly light weight. He does not recommend them for high-mileage running, as they do not provide a significant amount of cushion and have actually hurt his feet after a long workout. These shoes are also incredibly easy to ruin by playing agility-based sports that require quick side-to-side movements such as tennis and basketball. One of the ""cubes"" underneath the shoe actually sheared right off one of his brand-new shoes when playing basketball. However, these shoes are certainly not designed for those activities. 

In conclusion: the Nike Free Runs are fantastic, decently-priced shoes that are light and comfortable to wear daily at the casual level, but do not provide the type of support necessary for high-mileage running. If you are an avid runner and Nike fan, there are plenty of other product options available that better-fit this need.",161686043
880839,2,04/27/2017,Too Much Cushion I am a runner who went from the original Free Run 3+ 5.0s and these have too much cushion. My form is becoming less efficient with longer ground reaction time and greater ground impact forces. I can feel it and it is not good. The only plus is I can run on uneven surfaces more easily than when I was wearing my worn out 3+ 5.0s. Im returning these shoes to find something with an 8mm heel differential and less cushion before I lose the gains in leg strength that I had achieved prior. Very dissapointed.,159786431

Although they took a little longer to break into these are are a way better version than the other ones. I like the new laces and because of the backing, the back won't fold in half. I haven't washed them yet but it looks like the things that hold the laces will not go back into the shoe if i take the laces off and wash the sneakers. And i also like the new tounge.",169629377

These sneakers are super comfy & very cute on...very athletic looking. I own a few other Nike models like the flyknit & the Air Zoom...but the Free RN is the most comfortable even better than the distance models. Keep your feet snug & dry.

I've only worn these shoes a few times, but the sole has already started to get torn into and they feel loose on my heel despite the shoes themselves being the right size.

The shoe has no support for my ankle and I find my ankle always turning. Also, for a running shoe, it doesn't absorb a lot of the impact like it should, so it does cause me some back pain. It is fine for walking, but I wouldn't say it's great for running.",164075145
880840,3,06/16/2017,"Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned but... I was so happy to have found these shoes. The shoes looked perfect when I bought them. Kept the cardboard inserts to keep them looking good when not wearing them. I was worried about the fabric collapsing but it is good fabric. The problem is the toebox right at the edge of the sole and toe puckered so badly they look terrible. I  wish there was a way to prevent this from happening. If it wasnt for the high ticket price, I might have kept them. But given they were expensive, I feel this unexpected change in the shape of the shoe should not have happened within the first week. Perhaps I got a defective product...?I also overpronate and usually need a AA width. These were truly amazing and I walked and ran beautifully. I will look at other models of this shoe and see if there are some that dont do this strange puckering. I was so disappointed. But I will definitely consider Nike again.",163926998

The outside ankle area cushioning is made a bit too high, so it digs into the ankle and the toe material is thicker making that part of the shoe less flexible. Personally think last years version had a better style to it. Generally, the shoe is fairly comfortable but I would have expected more from Nike.",163370429

They hug your feet and fit like a glove, with a very close fitting seamless neoprene bootie. Unlike many reviewers on this thread I found the to-box to be ample in width and the shoe to be true to size. The fit and feel is very similar to Huaraches, the main difference being the barefoot like ride and of course the more conservative silhouette. These are probably one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had and whilst I wouldn't recommend doing this every day for hygiene reasons, I must say wearing them and walking in them sockless is really quite a pleasurable experience.",170294648

880841,5,08/06/2017,"Perfect travel shoe, order half size up, durable I've owned these for two months now and have put many miles of running and walking on them. They still fit snug, but are remarkably easy to take off and on at airports. Contrary to the other reviewer, I find them to be excellent running shoes. Good cushioning and support. I really like the color.

I always order size 10 Nikes, but bought the 10.5 after trying on the 10. Even after 2 months of wear the 10.5 still fits snug. I'd default to half size larger. They are somewhat narrow but the fabric is so easy to stretch that they are never uncomfortable.

For me, these are the perfect all-around shoe. I'd buy another pair when these wear out, although they're showing no signs of premature wear so far.",168018360
880841,5,07/19/2017,"Great every day shoe I love how comfortable the shoe is. Fits snug and feels like I'm wearing just a sock when i walk in them. The look is great as well and the wolf grey color blends well with almost anything I wear for work. I had to get a half size larger when trying them on and that was a perfect fit. I don't know about durability as I have only had them for about a week but it seems sturdy enough to last for a while. I wear these as a daily commute to work and don't necessarily run in them. I don't plan on putting unneeded stress on them as I have actual running shoes and they only serve one purpose for me.

Great walking shoe
Fits like a glove
Feels like a sock
Get a half size larger",166521210

I have always loved the comfort provided by Nike Free as well as the fit provided by the Nike Flywire. Having all those functional shoes, I wanted some thing ""athleisure-like"" and this looked the perfect fit. They are comfortable and easy to put on, plus look great (I have burgundy). As the title suggests, I wouldn't use these for running, but more so just going out and about, and if a slight jog is required (catch a train, a toddler, or making it across the street, they are perfect.

Is there any way to loosen up this shoe before putting it on via the shoe laces similar to traditional sneakers? NEver had this sock type sneaker before.

Since this shoe is more or like a sock almost, is it supposed to be kind of tight on you? The shoe fits great length wise but width wise, it seems a little tight on my foot.

I wear a 5.5 & Free RN are my go to so I have purchased several pairs throughout the progression of the shoe with no issues. I have to say this is the first time I am disappointed with my purchase even more so since I can't wear them because they are so tight. If I go up a size they are to long it is more about the width of the shoe. The stinky part of it is I can't return them as I have worn them several times to stretch them out.

These will be more for casual and daily street wear until they get their turn in my workout rotation. These are really comfortable, although slightly less than the older ones. These newer RNFk are more narrow and slightly tighter just above the toe box. However, these will likely stretch a little. They are super breathable, lightweight, and have a sock like feel to them. I hope they remain durable. Ive had some good luck w/ my older ones (although the oldest pair has a tear at the tongue, so I have to remember not to yank them too hard when putting them on. These also make excellent shoes for traveling. Not only are they comfortable and light, but the ability for them to basically lay down to the sole makes them very packable. If you are going on something like a 3 week trip to Europe and backpacking it, youre hard pressed to find a better shoe that not only often gets compliments on the appearance (in my experience anyways) but also ticks so many boxes. Just short of a formal shoe, these cover just about most other situations. My oldest pair are now basically water socks. I wouldnt hesitate to wear my newest ones out hanging with friends at a bar or patio. They also clean pretty easily in the sink and dry relatively quickly.",176651440
880843,5,11/26/2017,"Awesome shoe Without a doubt THE most comfy shoe I’ve had. Feels like one is in bare feet. Used for long distance walking & lounging. The minor bubble aforementioned at the toe is natural, like toe guards on other shoes and no problem at all.",176527588
880843,5,11/19/2017,"Also great as a sockless casual shoe! This is actually my 4th pair of Free Run Flyknits. I had the 3.0 and own 2 pairs of the 2016 version of this shoe, so I'm a long standing user of these and a big fan for use in my running....The main difference is I didn't buy these for running, I bought this pair particularly for casual wear. 

I prefer to go without socks as often as possible, but only in shoes that are comfortable and breathable and I must say that this shoe delivers in abundance on both counts. I have a pair of Free Run Commuters and it isn't possible to do this with them. The Free Run Flyknit 2017 is soft, supple, breathable and stylish. They look especially good with a shorter pair of skinny fit stretch jeans.",176207234

Now, all that said, I do have concerns about the durability, but I cannot ding them, as they are new.  Itll be interesting how this sock-like shoe holds up.",173319959
880843,3,10/07/2017,"Toe Bubble I am loyal to Nike through and through but these shoes are disappointing. Dont get me wrong, theyre comfortable and typical Nike flyknit quality but theres something with the toe....out of the box, they look just like the pictures but after you wear them in a bit, a bubble in the flyknit shows up on the toe. It makes the shoe look awful. There doesnt seem to be a way to get rid of it. Its permanently creased. Ive noticed it on other people as well with the same shoes. It sucks to love the look and feel of the shoe but then have it ruined based on nothing you did besides walk in them",172120915
880843,5,10/03/2017,Very comfortable and light. I run on trails mostly with Salomon gear but also occasionally on the walking paths so I wanted something light and minimal. These are perfect and very comfortable. Good job!,170760367

880843,4,09/10/2017,"Little Pillows of Heaven I previous had a three (or maybe four) year old pair of Nike Free's which held up well but had basically no sole support (had to put gel heals in them). I tried the 2016 Nike Free's and found that while the sole was improved it was pretty hard. I purchased the 2017 Nike Free Flyknits in Black/Volt/White and love them, like walking on little pillows of Heaven. Whatever Nike has done to the sole is perfect, please don't ever change! The color I chose also works good for business casual or a casual night out. I would prefer additional less wacky colors choices for business casual/night out. One star deducted since the top of the toe area does start to fold in on itself as others have pointed out, though I find you can't really see that while wearing them, when you hold them in your hand to put on its more noticeable and annoying.",169906985

- The sole is too narrow, the foot is slipping of the sole, the feeling that you have too little support surface makes me angry :)

I have a generally skinny foot and these shoes are a little too tight, even after playing with the laces. The Flyknit in this shoe is much thicker and causes a ton of creases above the toe area which over time grew to be an occasional annoyance. On a light note, the sole is still great and probably even better than last year's Free Run but with the other drawbacks, this shoe will take some getting used to.",166421119

The only downside is that I noticed that the soles of both shoes had melted during my FIRST RUN. They are still quite comfortable and look good, but it is quite unsettling knowing that the soles melted during their first run.",166161120
880843,3,07/09/2017,"Alright shoe, should be wider. Looks cool, but not that comfortable. Too narrow around midfoot. I have a somewhat narrow foot and this was still too snug. Also the upper material is too coarse, and you can feel it even with socks on.",166016109

The old ones had a soft and comfortable sockliner, and these new ones have a stiff material with no sockliner. It doesn't even feel like a normal shoe..my foot is spilling over the edge.

The shoe also runs very large, I had to go a full size down and had to return my first pair. I like to do trail runs and the shoe does not hold up well, the flyknit material snags easily and is getting pretty banged up. I would not expect having this shoe past 4-6 months (as with most nike shoes I have had).",164991105

I have narrow feet, so they actually fit better than most shoes do, although Im sure to some they are quite narrow. Size fits well, Im a size 16 and they fit perfect. Comfortable and light. Its not a shoe for ankle support, as expected. It is made to be as light as possible, and does quite well at that. Ive ran in them both on trails and treadmills, as well as a school track. Grip is decent, they flex well over small bumps and dips, although I havent really stepped on a large rock or anything yet. They have handled everything well. Overall great shoes...",164520908

I purchased the men's shoe because the toe box is wider than the women's. Anyway, after my 4th run that excitement went away fast. I agree with the review that said the sole compressed and the shoe had zero heel support. I had the same problem with mine. I'm 5'9"" and 130lbs, there is no reason the sole should have compressed after 4 runs. Really disappointed and going to see what my return options are.",164273872

They are great for running and having started training for a marathon I had full intentions of using these but after less than 200 training miles to date the sole has started to come apart at the heel which will make them unusable.",164159531
880843,1,06/20/2017,"Poorly designed shoe This shoe is poorly designed. When compared with the thoughtful design of the 2015 Nike Free 4.0 (and 5.0), the 2017 model doesn't compare. The most obvious error are the rubber nubs on the outsole. This part of the shoe is not a high wear zone; in fact the rubber on the heel doesn't touch the ground at all. This shows that not a lot of thought was put into this model. There is ample room in the toe box, but the midfoot is too tight. The fit is bizarre, wobbly and unstable. The shoe feels cheaply put together. The quality has dropped off in every area. Nike, PLEASE bring back the old Free designers, or hire new ones. What's happened to this shoe is depressing.",164158296

The cost was slightly higher than I would have liked however I think that they are worth the price and they are very comfortable to run in (having run 21 miles in my first week of owning them.) I wear them around casually sometimes due to the comfort and they fit very snug around the foot (I bought the size below my foot size as recommended), they are very lightweight and the sole of the shoe is easy to clean is dirty and colour is just how they look in the picture advertised (I own the red pair of these shoes.) The only negative is that the front of the shoe by the toe does wear away easily and leaves a rough patch which shows up quite clearly. Apart from that, a great pair of running shoes which I would highly recommend.",163045325

Other reviews state different problems with the toe box but mine just crease in the middle. It literally looks like the whole sock/sandal bit.

Also, when running, the heel of my other foot wouldn't land in the middle of the heel support; it kept creeping inside. I played around with the laces & socks, but nothing seemed to remedy either.

I looked to the left and had noticed it had done the same thing. I was eager to purchase these, and thought they would be stronger, but wouldn't recommend them again. Overall the shoe was comfortable. I was able to lace up and keep my foot in place and the flexibility was awesome, it's just the shoe wasn't strong enough.",158447058
880843,2,04/13/2017,"Great shoe held back by heel design I'll get down to the details. The shoe fits great everywhere except the heel. It feels as if there's too much material and space in the heel, which causes it to end up creasing and folding as I sprint/run. It's strange because the shoe fits perfectly fine everywhere else except the heel. 

Thinking I may have ordered a size too big, I had my brother try the shoes on (I'm an 11, he's around 11.5-12). He felt the same even though the shoe was an extremely tight fit everywhere else.

I'm unsure what the results would be after a long period of running with these. I'd imagine blisters or issues with the material would quickly pop up. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product as I feel anyone who wants to run in these shoes will encounter the same issues I had",158364701
880843,4,04/12/2017,"Overall Good This shoe has a great spring in your step and is perfect for running as well as being fantastic as a lifestyle shoe. Unfortunately unlike the previous flyknits, these ones let your foot slide out more so it feels unnatural when running because it makes you feel like your shoe is going to fly off your foot. Also, after tightening the laces, the shoes become incredibly tight the next time you put them on, and to make matters worse, hard is an understatement when referring to loosening the laces. 

Nevertheless, this is a fantastic shoe and is definitely worth purchasing whether it is for running, walking, or cycling.",158211094

I am a barefoot fan, so I like more feedback and lighter is much better. This shoe is perfect. I've run my short runs (2-4 miles) in them and It feels great. I have spent all day training in them and they are my go-to.

The knit conforms to my foot, which is usually the hardest part for me because I have a wider forefoot.

They aren't great for sudden lateral movements , as they are a little slippery in that sense. But they are a RUNNING shoe, not a training shoe.

This is the most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned and I am about to purchase them again in another color. The flyknit top conforms to my foot but does not constrict it. It is very breathable and I recommend to everyone who comments on them.",173319005
880844,4,10/05/2017,"Almost as good as the 4.0 Flyknit.... I was pleasantly surprised by the Free RN Flyknit 2017. It was a little tight at first , but then I realized it was because of how it came laced from from the warehouse.
Here is the breakdown..
The original Free 4.0 Flyknit from 2015 was the best in terms of width, comfort and heel size, everything.
The RN Flyknit was horrible. It had a gator like front, tighter and I always felt as if I was wearing heels.
This 2017 version is not as good as the 4.0, but is a very close second. I like them a lot.
The orange is the original and the best. It is like going barefoot. The purple is the RN flyknit and very uncomfortable . The 2017 version is the gray and it is like wearing padded socks.",171841927
880844,5,10/04/2017,"YES Ive owned flyknits before and I love them, these are no exception. I got the grey pair and they're so cute. I always get blisters from shoes and these do not give me any problems. They may feel tight at first, but they stretch out (not in a bad way) but soon you will be able to slip them on without ties which is pretty convenient. Plus, this price is a steallllll",170827778
880844,5,09/30/2017,"my favorite nikes I love these shoes. I don't use this pair for workouts but exclusively as casual fashion shoes when I want to be comfortable and active. I wore them for the first time at disneyland and after a whole day of tromping around on pavement, even my terrible knobby flat feet felt great and my legs didn't feel sore or fatigued. They're super light and just so comfortable. The stretchy knit is a brilliant material for a shoe! It feels like wearing a super supportive sock--I forget they are even there. They also look great. I get compliments on these literally every time I wear them.",170435653
880844,5,09/14/2017,Most comfortable walking shoes I love these new sneakers. I love the color options and how comfortable and stylish the shoes are. A great option for college students who walk on campus.,169995222
880844,5,08/30/2017,"Love. They are like slippers for your feet -- natural and neutral, and I'm always pumped when I can put these on! Light and sleek. Plus, retired pairs are great slip-ons for errands. I also just got a pair to wear touring Europe because they are cute, classy, and just all around comfortable. If you're not sure, just get them, and you'll understand when you put them on! :)",169630501
880844,1,08/23/2017,"Poor quality, extremely disappointing I am extremely upset with the quality of this shoe. These were the first pair of Nikes that I have ever owned and I was excited about my splurge, however; after one month of wear, the heels of both shoes started to collapse, meaning that my foot experienced slight torsion each time I took a step. The sole is made of a foam material that cannot handle long periods of walking on pavement. Indeed, not long after the sole started to peel off from the edges of the boot. After another couple of wears, both heels collapsed completely and the shoes were garbage. Unfortunately I was traveling in Europe at the time and could not return the shoes to my store in New York. Extremely disappointing, I do not think I will be splurging on Nikes again.",169357763

880844,2,08/16/2017,"Disappointing! I have owned 2 pairs of the Nike free flyknit 4.0s and absolutely loved them, but after lots of use the soles were starting to wear out so I needed a new pair. The 4.0s aren't sold anymore, so I went with the 2017. The color was very pretty, and I was excited about the shoes at first and then I started running. The shoes were the right size and seemed to fit well, but within 5 minutes of running the inside of the arch of my feet started to hurt. In less than 2 miles, I had 2 huge blisters from the shoes. I bought arch inserts for the shoes, tried socks with more cushion, but after 4 runs, each with new blisters, I've given up on the shoes. Wish I could return them but they've already been worn. Very disappointed as these were pretty pricey!",168912565
880844,5,07/31/2017,My favorite shoe These are the most comfy shoes that I own. Flexible. Lightweight. Best for daily use. I don't run in them.,167668037
880844,1,07/31/2017,"Big Disappointment First off, I would like to introduce myself as a fitness professional. I have been disappointed and have noticed the decline of the Free Flyknits since the incredible Flyknit 4.0. I have been wearing Flyknits since they first came out 4 or 5 years ago. These are by far the worst yet. I am assuming the design and fabric was changed to cut cost because these are not functional running shoes anymore.
My feet cramped on my usual 6 mile run and I got blisters from where the fabric meets the insides of my ankles, near where the laces tie. To top it all off, the sole has broken down on both sides after just a few runs.
I am at a loss because there are no other ""barefoot"" feel running shoes and I so desperately miss the Free Flyknit 4.0! Bring back the 4.0's!",167652714
880844,3,07/29/2017,"The material has flaws. Nike Free Flynits are all I ever wear. The last two versions, I have received shoes where the toe area dents in on the material. This does not look good! I bought my last pair at a Nike store.",167595009
880844,5,07/17/2017,MUST HAVE!!! If you have a wide feet thn this is the right shoes fr you. You dont have to break it in. It feels as if your wearing socks...i weigh in 260s 55  Im on my feet all day long at wrk.(12 hours plus) So Yasss this definitely covers the comfort part. so flexible. Im definitely going to keep buying these pairs.,166376748
880844,3,07/14/2017,"Very disappointed I bought my first pair of Flyknits after a friend recommended them for their comfort. Initially I fell in love with the shoes. They fit perfectly and were incredibly comfortable to wear, often forgetting I had trainers on! However, I have started to add a little bit of distance to my runs recently (up to 10 miles) and have found that after a few miles my feet are in agony causing me, on occasions, to have to stop. The pain comes in the top of my foot and is something I have never experienced while running before. I have recently replaced the trainers for another pair, also designed for the neutral foot, and found the problem has not returned, having had a few weeks of rest to recover. I feel the trainers are lacking in the support you need for running and function better as a fashion trainer. I would not buy these again for training.",166265105
880844,4,07/11/2017,"Fits great - shoe laces too small- can see these falling apart The heel is just fabric so there is no real ankle support here.  That being said they fit my wide feel by going up one size.  I also got elastic laces that were longer to get extra support. I can see these are already compressed in the heel after a few weeks so Im not certain there will really hold up, but so far I can complain.",166135783
880844,3,06/23/2017,"A Little Disappointed I bought these for running, as they are intended, but the switch to these from my old Nike Free pair has completely thrown off my stride and caused a bit of pain due to a lack of proper support. They also run a bit big, so I'd suggest going a half size down. They are also absolutely horrible for training. I was going for a run to the gym and then lifting, and the latter activity was so uncomfortable in these shoes. They just don't feel stable enough, and the material feels as though it could rip or fall apart quite easily. Honestly, I would return if I hadn't been wearing them for a couple of weeks now.",164370354
880844,2,06/21/2017,"Great look but terrible for running I was excited to finally try out this shoe, because I'd previously been running in my Nike Free Trainers. I felt that I'd have better runs and more foot support given that these shoes are actually designated for running. Although I love the breathable flyknit material and find the shoes to be comfortable for walks, they have sadly been disappointing for running. They have given me blisters and foot pains each time I've taken them out. I even went out and bought socks with better cushioning and support hoping that it would resolve the shoe issues, but it did not. They were not at all what I expected from Nike. Sad to have to retire them to the back of the closet after a month of repeated tries to make it work.",164170868
880844,5,06/19/2017,IN LOVE The shoes are great. I bought a pair one year ago and a new pair just a week ago. They are so comfortable that it feels like I'm walking on clouds. They are so stylish. I always get compliments on this style of shoes. Great work Nike with these ones!,164087483
880844,4,06/16/2017,"Overall a Great Shoe I purchased this shoe to use for my track team,I wanted something comfortable and light as I run long distance. (800m, 1600m, 5k) I loved it for the season and use it as casual wear now, but there are a few thing that need some work. This wasnt a problem for me but I know it will be for some; I have toothpick ankles. This shoe supportted my ankle (in the way a flyknit* shoe should) very well and it fit tightly (in a good way) It was very comfortable with thicker socks (like the nike mens training socks) and thinner, but if you have larger ankles, this could give you blisters (as it did my mother, in ONE day) Also, this is just personal preference; I think the sole could be a litte thicker. I run cross country as well and I adore how it bends to fit with the environment (ex. sand, steep hills, rocky terrain) but it could use like a half a cm overall. Otherwise this shoe is super comfortable and highly recommended",163925888
880844,4,06/13/2017,"Love these shoes I love everything about these shoes! The color stands out, they are super comfortable with just the right support and cushion for a high intensity workout. Nike keep up the good work!",163724615
880844,3,06/13/2017,"Very comfortable, but disappointed This product was recommended by a friend who said they were very comfortable and great for running. I run doing HIIT and they completely lived up to their hype, however I left them on when I went into the sauna after wearing them for the first time and the fabric melted and wrinkled re shaped the toe area. I didnt realize it until I felt my feet burning, so I took them off and tried to reshape them. Unfortunately that didnt work, so Im dissapointed because they were brand new! So my advice is to not wear them in any type of intense heat.",163673122
880844,5,06/02/2017,"AWESOME SHOES! Hands down the best running shoes I had so far for medium distance (15k max done with this shoes without any issue). If you run a lot I'll suggest get up to a size bigger than your normal one. Extremely comfortable, you really don't feel them when you running or generally training. Stylish too (so extra brownie point!) Hopefully they will NEVER discontinue them.",162944347
880844,5,05/18/2017,Great colors Not gonna lie had to buy my wife two pairs of these shoes.. Great  colors!!!  She said loved them cuz they felt like she was wearing no shoes! great price!  Nike is the best hands down!!!!,161837692
880844,2,05/16/2017,"Very Disappointed !!! The best shoes I have ever had was the Nike Free 4.0 Flyknit. From the first minutes of wearing them it was true love! My Flynit 4.0 were getting old needed to be replaced. I was learned they were discontinued. They told me the the 2017 were the replacements, so I gave them a shot. In the store they felt fine but I did my normal hike up and down hills about 3-4 miles and my feet hurt! They rub around the ankle and my toes were numb. I am pretty bummed and they are going back to the store! PLEASE I beg you..... bring back the Nike Free 4.0 Flyknit!",161679309
880844,2,05/12/2017,I was happy but then.... I recently went to a Nike store to purchase shoes for dance and the Nike free run flynit 2017 was recommended. I tried them on and I loved them and the store had great service.  The shoe feels comfortable and I loved it but only after wearing this shoe three times to a dance class the sole on one of my shoes has torn on the front! I am very sad and upset about this. I spent money on a shoe that was supposed to last way more than three days. I dont know what to do because Ive already worn them.,161378430
880844,2,05/10/2017,"Will Not Be Keeping I don't know what the motive was to stop producing the Nike Free Flyknit 4, but after scouring the internet for the last few available pairs, I finally bought the new Free RN. I used to train and run my marathons in the Free 4 and found the shoe to fit like a glove. It was lightweight and perfect, and I never had to break in a new pair-they were perfect out of the box. I knew that the RN would be slightly different, and that it would have a little more support, but I was told multiple times by Nike employees that I would love it. I was hesitant (my new pair sat in the box for a couple of weeks before their first run) but hopeful that the changes wouldn't be too noticeable... Unfortunately, they were. This shoe base feels completely different, for some reason the flyknit material does not fit as smoothly and is almost uncomfortable, maybe even scratchy, and much less breathable. The extra support was way more apparent than I had hoped-the thing I loved about the Free 4 was how lightweight and natural the shoe felt, almost unnoticeable. The Free RN felt the complete opposite, and as much as I tried to like it, I will be taking my pair back. Not sure what I will do when I can no longer train for my marathons in my Free 4s... but at this point, with the latest 'natural ride' offerings, it looks like I will no longer be a Nike runner.",161185191
880844,5,05/08/2017,"This is perfect for gym training too I primarily use it to train in the gym and for running outdoors and its perfect for both! It offers the perfect support for my feet, especially the midsole area. Definitely buying another pair.",160820088
880844,5,05/05/2017,Lightweight and breathable These shoes look and feel great and are worth every penny. The flyknit is extremely breathable and the shoe itself is incredibly light. You will not regret this purchase.,160574759

880844,5,04/23/2017,Favorite Sneaker This is by far the most comfortable and best fitting sneaker I have ever had. Bought my pair 4 months ago at a Nike store and they still feel and look like new. I was concerned the knit might lose its elasticity over time but this had not been the case. Excellent sneaks!,159391728
880844,3,04/22/2017,"Last years model was so much better! :( I just recently discovered the Nike free flyknit and i am totally in love. I have really narrow feet which usually swim in any other shoe on the planet, but not these. I bought three of last years model, and two of this years, not realizing that this years model is much different. It's much bigger. Not only does it run longer, but it's not nice and snug like a sock on my foot any longer. Also the pattern of the material is not as ribbed/textured anymore. I'll be returning the new model shoes, and just hope that next year they change them back to awesome way they used to be.",159306203

These shoes fit perfect which doesn't normally happen, I have narrow feet but because of the knit, they will give to whatever your size foot it. There was zero breaking in-they have been comfortable since the first time I've worn them. I am writing this before I purchase my second pair. Worth every penny, glad I made the investment-I walk/run about 6mi/day on rocks, sidewalks, trails-I cannot really speak for durability of the sole yet since I haven't had mine more than a month. I'm hoping they last as the knit does have a good amount of rebound to it. Cheers.",157060623

These shoes are very light weight, snug form fitting and comfortable. The flyknit and Free outsole technology make your feet feel very natural when walking/running and you feel agile and nimble all day. However, I try to wear socks that rises higher than the ankle part of the shoe as that kind of digs into your achilles a little when against bare skin. Not a huge problem though. Also the black rubber bumpers on the heel of the shoes tends to peel off after some time. I am going to try to use some super glue or something to keep that in place. Overall I love the shoe. I would wear these everyday but I need some more color ways to match them up with my wardrobe.",170032895

880845,2,07/20/2017,"Do not rely on these for running/training These shoes are nice if you want to walk around in. I would say they are more casual than anything. Whenever I do sprints either outside or on the treadmill the shoes feel like they are either going to give out and sometimes it feels as if my feet are moving in them. If I wear them for awhile it begins to impinge on my toes and becomes really uncomfortable. Last week I wore them for a test, and my toes begin killing me...I have skinny feet and have never had this problem before",166588577
880845,2,06/28/2017,"From a Flyknit Motion Lover: New Features Cause Pain/Discomfort To preface this review, I am a marathon runner and try to get in a 5-20 mile run every day. Nike has been my go-to stop for everything running and I have been very satisfied up until this purchase. I've probably put 60 miles on these to date.

I have owned the Free 3.0, Flyknit 3.0, 2016 Motion Flyknit, and now this 2017 Motion Flyknit. Pretty much following the new releases every year. All have been among the most comfortable shoes I've worn, each new rendition, better than its predecessor. I was hesitant to buy this iteration due to the laceless and over-ankle aspect, but I took the plunge. Since day one I've experienced discomfort with this shoe. 

During my speed workouts where I am on the balls of my feet, I will experience pain in my achilles. I have found this to be due to a very stiff heel in the shoe. I love the flyknit material, but for structural purposes I assume, the heel on this shoe is not the same material as the rest. I can pinpoint my pain to a spot exactly where the material is different. There is a point where the 'cuff' on the ankle material presses against my tendon causing unrelenting discomfort.

Secondly, these shoes are very narrow leading to pain in my outer foot. My feet are wider than most, but this hasn't been an issue in previous Nike shoes. With the 2017 Motion shoes the straps are positioned at the exact spot where my feet are widest, putting pressure on the exact wrong spot. I've experimented with the straps, both tight, one loose, both loose. There is still discomfort. I am not concerned about sizing because there is ample room in the toe box. Loosening the straps alleviates some discomfort, but at the cost of my feet not being locked in as well ex. the point of the straps. However, if you have a more narrow foot, the straps will be tight and hold your foot in place very well.

Overall, I am dissatisfied and should have waited to see if there will be a more traditional 2017 version. The two main features of this shoe cause discomfort that was not there with the more traditional look and feel. To end I don't normally write product reviews, but I would like to caution anyone with wider feet to avoid these because, the straps will cause pain.",164693577
880845,5,06/13/2017,"How Flyknit is supposed to feel. Really enjoying them. I'd put them up there with Lunarepics and LeBron X's. Great ground feel while maintaining plenty of cushioning. They are not as soft as Lunarepics, but the straps give a very nice and snug fit. The heel cup and, ""toe box"" keep movement solid. True to size for slightly wider feet. Ankle collar works well with low sock and while I dislike straps on shoes (can't wait for LeBron lows), It's perfect here.",163725342
880845,5,06/10/2017,"Lightweight Performance Shoe! Amazingly stable and straps keep foot secure. I ran with them on the treadmill today and then did my gym workout. You could easily run 5k's with this shoe. The straps are great because you can reposition them through velcro to tighten or loosen a bit depending on need. I would like to see this kind of strap added to the Pegasus FlyEase 33.

Overall this shoe does more than just look cool.",163521762

880845,2,06/02/2017,"Great Shoe, until... I absolutely loved running in these shoes--they had great road feel, good responsiveness, and felt like they ran true to size, until I got to about 120 miles into owning the pair. I suppose I hadn't noticed, but the right ankle of the shoe was so tight that is actually caused my ankle to become inflamed, irritated and swollen to a point where it became almost impossible to run in them without discomfort. Even after switching to an older pair of low-top Frees and the swelling subsided, the right shoe's ankle remained too tight and was immensely irritating. I'm not sure what happened or why, or if it was a manufacturing problem with the right shoe and NOT the left, but i simply cannot run in them anymore. The left shoe fits true to size in all aspects, but the right shoe is very tight around my ankle and causes pain and swelling with even short distance runs (for me, 5-8 miles). I want to recommend these because they started strong, but I can't because I wouldn't wish this kind of frustration on anyone.",162941575
880845,1,05/31/2017,"disappointing direction I have been very happy with the improvements since free 3.0 until this 2017 one; The material at the heel is stiffer than on previous versions and uncomfortable just to walk around with.

I mostly been using the shoes for jump roping (hard to find a shoe for jump roping) and the stairclimber machine. Also been using the shoe when working out on the punching bags, due to the fact the shoe doesn't have laces, I can kick the bag too. It's like a well cushioned sock with grips.",162413918

Went for a 2 mile run to try them out having the exact same result .   Ive never had any shoe do that before .   I wanted them for marathon training ,  sad to say I had to return them",161616264
880845,3,05/15/2017,"Great idea, so-so implementation I love the Flyknit and crossing strap design of these shoes. They feel stable enough while remaining nice and flexible, like wearing a cushioned, supportive sock. 

However as others have mentioned, the sole design is pretty bad. They collect mud and small rocks like crazy. Also, if you look at them from the side, you'll notice how much heel there is protruding out the back, away from where the sock is. Most peoples heels don't stick out that far, and it leaves too much of the shoe a bit loose behind my heel towards the back/bottom of the shoe. I'd also prefer less slope, or rocker, in the front near the toes. 

Otherwise they're pretty great, even if a bit narrow for me. I look forward to an improved next generation soon. Really love the all black color way.",161596750
880845,5,05/14/2017,"I can't stop staring at these shoes. Amazing sock-like shoes like the Lunarepics. I would say these are even more comfortable, since you don't have to worry about laces at all. 

The sole brings the same comfort you get with any Free, and the upper (I got it in the all-black version) looks stunning, *BUT* unlike the other Free RNs, I didn't order half size down, and I'm glad I didn't because even though the Flyknit upper is forgiving, the straps are not as elastic as I would expect, which is not bad considering they are the only sources of foot lockdown.

In a nutshell, these are the coolest-looking, most comfortable Free RNs I have.

(I cannot really rate the durability since these are still pretty new)",161517154
880845,1,05/11/2017,Sole has no soul This may be the worst designed sole ever. Picks up and keeps every small rock or pebble. See photos,161229209
880845,5,05/06/2017,"Superior Upgrade This shoe is a really superb upgrade to the 2016 model (which I really liked a lot ). Starting from the bottom, the ""auxetic"" patterned Nike Free sole is amazing. This year's sole seems a few millimeters thicker (and perhaps the midsole foam was reformulated) but, the shoe doesn't seem heavier or more unstable. I'm a mid to forefoot striker. So, I really appreciate the level of (in this order) flexibility, cushioning and stability that is engineered in this design: super nice!

The 2017's Flyknit upper doesn't have the pronounced exterior tubule-like texturing as compared to the 2016 model. This change along with what feels like a refinement in the Nike Flyknit yarns has a noticeable improvement in the interior (next-to-skin side). This is a big plus for those who want to skip wearing socks. I've gone on several 5K runs wearing this shoe sans socks: no blisters! Depending on shoe fit, running distance and other factors, this may not be ideal for everyone tho.

The straps provided a measured amount of lockdown fit. The crossover ""X"" placement also contributes positively to the aesthetics of this shoe. But, personally, I hope the near future brings a version of the NIKE FREE RN MOTION FLYKNIT without the straps (or laces). I imagine this near future would also require a combination of personalized, custom tuned Nike Flykint yarns and precise scans of both of your feet. I anxiously await this future!

Final notes:
I purchased both the 2017 versions of the NIKE FREE RN MOTION FLYKNIT (Black/Pure Platinum/Wolf Grey/White) and the NIKELAB FREE RN MOTION FLYKNIT (Sail/Black/Mushroom/Black). Alas, I could not recommend the NIKELAB FRNMF (what a mouthful)! These kicks appear nearly the same with the exception of colorway and minor material differences. But, in my experience, the fit was a bit too narrow for my slightly wider than average feet (men’s US size 11.5). If Nike posts my review, check it out for all the details. Anyway, I’m Very interested to see how these kicks perform for others! Lastly, I made my purchases of the first run colorways in April. But, I’m really digging the new colorway drops: fresh!",160677240
880845,2,05/06/2017,Eh I had to return these shoes because the black grips fell off in less than 2 weeks. They weren't that comfortable either. Probably won't recommend these shoes:(,160655296

880845,4,04/20/2017,This product looks really cool I have no problems with my product exept for when I run outside on a surface that is not pavement. The soles pick up a bunch of gravel in between those bumps that get you the grip because they are so deep.,159113430
880845,5,04/15/2017,Like wearing a sock When you first put the shoes on you feel your feet held nice and snug because of the nice convenient straps that are on the shoe. The straps help keep your feet snug and stable to focus on keeping your feet down on the ground. I would recommend this shoe to anyone that enjoys a nice sock like experience for running or for everyday use.,158540865
880847,5,10/30/2017,"OMG Fast!! From the first run I could feel an extra pop. I am a midfoot striker and the pop is noticeable. These shoes are light and offer a very comfortable ride. I'm 6'0, 172#, 51YO male. I like a soft ride.
I raced a half marathon today (1:25:03) and using Jack Daniels VDOT running calculator I can compare two recent 10k races to my half marathon time. I calculate these shoes improved my half marathon time a full 2%. That's 2 full minutes in the half, incredible. 
I can not speak to durability yet as I only have 18 miles on this pair. They will be my marathon racing flats. 
Yes, I would prefer to pay less, but I am trying to think what I would be willing to pay for a 4 minute faster marathon. 4 min can be the difference between qualifying for Boston or not. 4 min can be the difference between breaking 3 hours or not. If I can run a 2:59 or better in these shoes, I'll have that PR forever, a month from now I won't remember the $250.",175428033

I have run 6 marathons in the Vaporfly 4 and I am sure the shoes have helped me defy gravity by running each marathon at least 5 minutes faster than I had run the same marathons in in 2016. I love the shoes but I had some durability issues with the rear black rubber sole falling off after the 3rd marathon race in the first pair of Vaporfly 4s that I owned. I loved the shoe and I hated to return them. I got a second pair from a Nike reseller and the same rubber piece came loose after my first marathon in the shoes. Instead of returning a second pair of these great shoes, I got some shoe repair glue and repaired the rear sole that had come loose in my race. The glue worked and I Won my age group in my next marathon wearing the repaired shoes. The shoes truly are awesome and I’m sure Nike will fix the sole coming loose problem. I am eagerly standing buy to buy my 3rd pair of Vaporfly 4s as soon as they become available.",175234556
880847,5,10/20/2017,"The Best In Durability Actually So I added a review about the Zoom Streak 6 and it's durability issues in the Upper..The upper tore for me after 175miles (280km)...

So I think I've retired my Baby Blue 4%'s with 600+ Miles..the Midsole took a beating after 30 miles..but just because it looks bad doesn't mean its functionality is compromised in any way...IT IS NOT! After about 300 Miles an area in the Midsole between the Index of my Toe and the ""Big"" Toe there was a huge ""dip"" impression..(the cushion in that area was ""pushed-in""(depressed)) and again..did not affect the shoe in any way..after 450+ miles the Rubber (black) blast in the Midsole starting wearing to the ZoomX foam..but at the front of the foot..and it was probably at this point the Mesh in the upper started tearing where the tearing occurred in the Streak 6..with 600 miles now..the Mesh has torn a bit more..but not so much that the shoe is unusable..These are VERY durable shoes..that look like they get the junk beat out of them in a very short period of time..ZOOMX feature!",173826003
880847,5,10/01/2017,"BEST SHOE EVER but wear on sole is concerning Got these 2 weeks ago and took 9 seconds off my 5 miles PB on the first night training without even trying. 3 days later took 5 1/2 minutes off my half marathon PB (including over a minute off my 10 mile during the race). These runners are by far the easier shoe I every ran in.

My concern is the wear on the sole is already showing after just 18 miles.
I'm afraid to wear these in training and haven't in my last 4 runs but the biggest rule in marathon running is break in your shoes.

The question is do I return them (within the 30 day period) knowing that the wear will only get worst or do I risk all and do 1 long break-in run (22 miles) and then just keep them for racing hoping I get a few marathons out of them.",170692222

Pleased to say they did exactly what they said they would and on race day I knocked 20 minutes off my PB, finishing at 3:20. I love the shoes but sadly had to return them as after only 66km the soles were badly worn. I'll definitely buy these again when Nike fix the problem.",170431225

Bought to run Manchester Half Marathon in them in 8 weeks time hoping for them to take me sub 1:20 but after only two runs I have decided to return the shoes due to the durability concerns I have with them, after only on 23 miles put in the shoes they are showing considerable wear in the heal which makes me think they would not even last over 100 miles, I know they are a race shoe but I just expected them to be more durable, I also have ZoomFly with over 200 miles now in them which I use for tempo runs and they still have a lot of life still in them

880847,5,08/02/2017,Greatest running I ever own! This shoe live up to the hype! My 1st run was 10miles (I usually average 1351 per mile) was a whopping 1105 ! The only problem is will Nike re-stock ? Will they make bigger sizes ( I have a13 but really could use a 14)? How long will these shoes hold up over time (like over 100miles )?  Great Job Nike,167799986
880847,5,08/02/2017,"Believe the Hype All I can say is wow. I managed to scoop these up locally after striking out on nike.com and as soon as the sales associate put them on my feet I was sold. I stood up and could immediately feel the effect of the ZoomX midsole and was even more blown away by the sheer responsiveness and bounce when I did a trial run on a treadmill in-store. I know it sounds like a lot of hyperbole but I honestly never felt a shoe like this before, from Nike or otherwise. I mostly run to train for basketball and football so I can't really speak for those looking to use these for road races and/or marathons but the difference I felt during and after running 3-5 miles in these compared to others was completely night and day. Nike's Innovation Kitchen really cooked up something special with these and their ZoomX technology and I can't wait to see this implemented in other models and possibly other silos such as basketball (if that's possible).

As for sizing, my true size is 98% always 10.5 but the Flymesh upper is so thin and lightweight that I had to go down to a 10 for these. Also, the forefoot is purposely wider than most other runners (in my experience at least) to allow your toes to better flex and expand on foot strikes so keep that in mind. I really recommend trying these on in person if possible and if not, half a size down should be a safe bet for most.",167752229

880847,5,07/29/2017,"Impressed I have the new Zoom Fly shoes and I really liked those, so I got the 4% just to see what the extra technology could possibly do - and they delivered! Wednesday I did mile repeats in my Zoom Fly shoes. Today I did a harder mile repeat workout in the 4% - not only were my split times significantly faster (at least 4% faster), but the workout felt far more effortless than the Wednesday workout. 
Not a lot of data points yet, but I was certainly impressed with this. Will be curious to see how they hold up - 20 miles on them so far and they still look brand new. 
One small thing - the tongue of the shoe is strange and the inner part actually cuts my ankle. I am going to try a few ways to fold the tongue to prevent it, wear higher socks or possibly just cut the tongue shorter. This wouldn't cause me to return the shoe, as I am sure I can fix It, but it is worth noting as I cannot imagine I'd be the only person this would happen to (I am female, so perhaps it is because it is a unisex shoe). 
Great job Nike!",167592446

880847,5,07/27/2017,"Incredible Sense of Propulsion Amazing feeling as soon as you stand in these. Extremely lightweight with a true fit.
The downsides are durability and cost. The heel of the sole has worn away exposing the foam after 8 miles. Disappointing for a shoe at this price point. 
Still in the early stages but these are a definitely a game changer.",166967207
880847,5,07/26/2017,"The only option When the shoe finally launched, I was extremely excited, and when I came through the line and was able to buy the product, everything went perfectly well - So well done to you Nike for making it so easy and not complicated to place an order on your site!

Enough about Nike in general, let's talk about the shoe. Putting it shortly, IT'S AMAZING! 

First of all, the looks. It is unbelievably sexy to look at and looks wise, I'd prefer this shoe to any other running shoe on the market. Believe it or not, it's actually even sexier when you see the shoe in real life, geez.

Secondly, the way it fits. It feels snug and tight, yet surprisingly light and airy. It's so comfortable to wear, and as soon as you start running it becomes even comfier.

Now, the ""Ultralight Nike ZoomX midsole delivers our greatest energy return."" is by far the best and most ingenious part of the shoe. There's quite nothing out there much like it, and it leaves the Adidas Boost shoes far behind. The feel of it can't really be described in a proper way. It's super freaking soft, yet it responds and bounces back in an absolutely unbelievable way. Running in the shoe feels like you always run with a tailwind pushing you forward, making every stride easier, and motivating you to keep on going. 

And that 4% part, is not a lie at all - I've recently come back from a two-year long knee injury, and I've not been able to run a training 5k in under 19 minutes since I've come back - That is up until now. Today I completed an 18:12 5k, for the first time in years, and it feels amazing.

so THANK YOU, Nike, you've done an amazing job!",166940310
880847,5,07/26/2017,"Beyond expectations! I've been looking forward to this release for quite a while now and finally received them today. They went straight to feet and it's been a while since I literally said ""wow."" 

Extremely lightweight, fit is great and TTS. I can immediately feel the new zoom cushioning system and how the shoe reacts with each step. I am beyond impressed. Nike did a great job with these! I would definitely recommend these if you're in the market.",166936655
880847,5,07/25/2017,"Wow! I normally wouldn't be so enthused about a running shoe but I have to give credit to Nike for doing something really innovative here. Their attempt (so close!) to break the 2 hour marathon with this technology really captured my attention and I've been looking forward to getting these shoes since I first heard about them.

So what are my first impressions running with Nike's Zoom Vaporfly 4% shoes?

Wow! The shoes felt great and what was supposed to be an easy training run turned into a really good tempo run.

The shoes are amazingly light. The soles are firm (not surprizing given the carbon fiber plate the provides a lot of the rigidity and spring) but I felt cushioned at the same time. The soles are also higher and more angled than what I'm used to and it took me a little while to adjust but once I did, they felt great. The upper part of the shoe is a type of canvas (possibly mixed with some synthetic materials) that I've not had in other running shoes. I'm used to running with my laces relatively loose but I had to tighten these to reduce an initial sense of ""wobblieness"". 

I suspect some of the engineering trade-offs with these shoes is that while they are lighter and faster they will be less durable (kinda of like a fancy sports car) but if the shoes live up to their promise of getting me that ""4%"" then it's a trade I'm happy to make.",166911293
880847,5,07/25/2017,wow the sole on this shoe is incredible it launches you forward as you run making you a lot faster. its like cheating almost dont tell your track teammates about them,166907735
880847,5,07/23/2017,Nike Vaporfly 4% I ran with these shoes for the first time in Prospect Park Brooklyn this morning July 22. I ran 3.5 miles to see how the shoe would feel and handle. The shoe felt great. It makes one seem to run faster and at the same time the cushioning was terrific. I couldn't feel the pounding and the pavement and being an older runner this was important to me. The fit was perfect for my feet and very comfortable. It was so light it felt like I was running barefoot. I would highly recommend these shoes. They seemed super to me.,166706089

I usually have to go up a size and double-sock for my distance shoes or else the outside of my feet get blistered pretty bad.

These shoes are great right off the bat. I've only had the shoes for a week now (that's why I'm not reviewing durability yet), but they are definitely good for wide-footers. I've never had a running shoe fit true to size with its width, so this is great to see.",175123175

880848,5,10/06/2017,Cushioned distance runner I recently ran a marathon in these shoes after running a handful of training runs in them. I am coming back after a stress fracture and looking for cushion to offset my healed bone. These are perfect. As I understand this offset is specifically for taking stress off the Achilles. Well the cushion also is great relief off the joints throughout the leg. I ran close to my PR taking it kind of easy. Awesome shoe! Order a half size up for a perfect fit.,172086216

Last week I ran the Berlin Marathon. This is the first marathon that I have run with ZOOM FLY'S. They made me feel like I was floating.

880848,5,09/26/2017,"Different. But Excellent This shoe takes a little getting used to. The ride is unlike anything else I've experienced but superb once you're used to it. Ample cushioning whilst remaining very responsive. For me, this shoe is better suited for longer distances, I think it feels a bit cumbersome for 10k and under. You're going to want to size up slightly too. I take a 10 in everything else and a 10.5 in these is perfect. A word of caution though, if you heel strike, you're probably going to shred these in no time. The heel area around the edges is exposed 'foam' and is soft, so I imagine will break down quickly. Generally though, I think durability is good for mid/forefoot strikers, I've put 200 miles on my pair and there is barely a mark on the soles. Overall, an excellent shoe and I would definitely consider spending a bit more on the 4% if/when they become available again.",170343818
880848,1,09/24/2017,"Great while they lasted... When I received these shoes in July I strongly felt they were the best running shoes I had ever worn. Running on level roads was so effortless and fast it almost seemed like cheating.
Now almost 3 months later durability issues with these shoes have changed my opinion. After only 70 miles of use the inner midsole has become completely crushed to the point that the shoe is visibly tilted inward when setting on a flat surface. I bought these shoes to do an uptempo run each week but can no longer wear them as I am certain to injure myself if I continue use. All of my other running shoes are neutral and I have never encountered this problem before with any other shoe, even after a few hundred miles of use. I first noticed the problem while running on a slightly sloped paved shoulder of a local road. I tried only running on level surfaces after this, but once the midsole was deformed it hurt to run in these shoes. The heel midsole is so high, so soft and so narrow on these shoes that they are inherintely unstable. They might be suitable for occasional races but that is all in my opinion.",170290842

If you buy these make double sure your feet are narrow enough.",170118845
880848,5,09/16/2017,"One of the Best I've been alternating between these, the 4%, and the pegasus 34 for the past ~2 months and I've loved every run in each pair. Generally, I only use these shoes for mid-paced runs as they do persuade you to go faster than most other shoes. While that's great for racing and hitting workouts with fast intervals, they're not really a great recovery day shoe.

The only downside, which is pretty minor, is that upper somehow manages to get really dirty really fast (I have the breaking 2 colorway). I almost exclusively run in a city so this was really surprising to me, but not really a big deal since the shoe preforms well.

Overall, I would recommend all three pairs to everyone. They're incredibly comfortable and they continue to preform well and continue to help me drop PRs 200+ miles in. Not much more you can ask for out of a shoe.",170059098

I bought these shoes a few months ago when they came out and got in a few runs before I ran a marathon on Monday that was on concrete, gravel and asphalt on one of the toughest courses around and these shoes rocked! Great cushioning and a very nice ride. My legs were not prepared to run that far but these shoes made it happen. Worth every penny. Nicely Done Nike!",169865639
880848,3,09/08/2017,"Not for causal run This is not a shoe for someone who is just trying to run casually. This is a very stiff shoe. The cushion system is great but stiff. It does push you a little ""further"" if you just a little push to finish your run (in case of training or long-distance run). The other problem is the ventilation; your feet will get hot after a while. Returned the shoes. Pegasus might be a better option if you just want to run, not train to run.",169827822
880848,5,09/07/2017,Best shoes I have had Since I have bought these shoes I have smashed all my PBs in running. My fastest 10k before I got them was 42:05 but I have since ran 4 sub 41 10ks with my fastest to date being 40:40 as I aim to break the 40 minute barrier! I.

It springs you forward as you run and made me decrease long run mile splits by over ten seconds, just by switching out with my old pair. They fit pretty tight, but are definitely worth every dollar, and are good for long distance training. I have about 200 miles on them and they are still in great shape.",169772919

Typically shoes that are comfortable, light and cushioned aren't responsive enough for me (I'm 6'4"" and 210 lbs), and vice versa. These shoes have it all. I've run in them six times 5-7 miles each run and I've already had my three best runs of the year in them.",169528326
880848,5,08/21/2017,"Best Nike shoes yet. Far from just a marketing campaign, these shoes really deliver. A great design, allows for cushioning without the weight. Also appear super durable, which i was surprised at for a racing shoe. Take the plunge, you wont go back.",169265832

These are the first shoes Ive ever tried which have made a significant difference to how I run and how fast I run. Cushioning is excellent, they change my running style because I automatically get pushed forward. Time on the ground is simply shorter than usual.I am really impressed with these shoes and can only recommend getting a pair!",169123295
880848,5,08/16/2017,FAVORITE SHOE OF ALL TIME When I bought these shoes I had no clue what to expect... THESE ARE THE BEST SHOES I HAVE EVER RAN IN! I am a high school runner that runs more than 40 miles a week and I swear these shoes make me want to run longer and faster. Ive never been so excited to put on my shoes and go for a run because in these shoes I know Ill feel good and run fast! They are very light and durable too! The price is very reasonable. Nike did their best job yet! Cant wait to try the 4%s,168920487
880848,5,08/11/2017,"Best Nike I've Run In The lightweight, responsive, comfortable shoe that I've been hunting for years. You did it right this time, Nike, and have ruined me for all other shoes. I'm marathon training and at 45 miles per week right now. The Zoom Fly has added comfort and speed to those longer runs that I've not felt in any other shoe. It creates a truly unique running experience and I'm hooked on it. I'll wear it them in the Marathon and won a 5K in them last week. Perfect at every distance in between.

It is slightly narrow through the midsole, but not to the point where it is bothersome. It breathes well and offers some structure in the upper, but not too much to be restrictive. The carbon-infused plate blended with the foam sole creates a springy, fast, comfortable and minimal-resistance ride. It's rained every day since I bought them, so I'm probably ruining them running in the rain, but they even hold up well on slick surfaces. 

Nike, please add more shoes like this to your rotation. You are truly onto a revolution in distance footwear.",168522757

This shoe is amazing; I took these out first run in pouring rain on a 9 miler, barefoot, these shoes took my pace down by 20 seconds, and reduced the anaerobic fatigue on my muscles by about 40-50%. 

A little chaffing on the heel and where the tongue is, but at the same time I was running barefoot. 

Looking at the bottom/heel afterwards, looked pretty solid to me post run.

As soon as I tried them I knew they were something special; long runs and speed work alike felt incredibly effortless thanks to their superb cushioning and lightweight feel.

However, I have only been using them for just over a month and have noticed that the sole has worn away considerably near the heel; meaning they aren't offering as much support as they once did.

880848,1,07/14/2017,"SO wanted to like them Like many other reviews these shoes are beautiful and once you get them on it feels like they force U to move ahead. However, the fit is off. My heel and arch seemed to be positioned in an area not meant for a wider foot.

However, I bought a pair of these sneakers and they are a complete game-changer. They are light, provide tremendous stability and I can really focus on my form. It feels like I have nothing on my feet because they are so light. When I want to kick it up a notch these shoes really let you go into high gear. They are incredible. I look forward to every single run. The only minor quibble I have is the laces pinch a little on the ankle. Apart from that they fit perfectly. A true marvel. I love 'em.",166250471

Love the snappy toe-off and the forward roll sensation... the shoe just feels fast and comfortable, especially at tempo paces. The stiffness give it a race shoe feel, but the cushioning provides the comfort and protection needed for training and long runs. Really fantastic. My ONLY gripe is the same as some of the other reviews: the back of heel collar is a little high and has caused some rubbing on my achilles. Got a blister the second time I wore them. I've been really careful since then to wear slightly higher socks which seems to have prevented or curtailed the problem. Hopefully, in the next iteration of the shoe, Nike will notch the heel collar or something.",166230781
880848,5,07/13/2017,"Great Shoe After having put 57 miles on my Zoom Fly's so far, I'm very happy with them. I think comments about how the shoe does tend to demand focus on form, stride and foot landing / placement are true --- at least for me. I tend to need a neutral to stability leaning shoe and the Zoom Fly seems very neutral. As I train for the Chicago Marathon this October 8th, I'm happy I've chosen these along with the Pegasus 34 as my training and race day shoes. May look at the Vapor 4% as well once it's released - if its similar to the Zoom Fly -- only better --- I'm on board, great shoe!",166222014

I've been running in Air Zoom Structures for years, and these are the first new running shoes I've tried out in ages. I'm now 62.6 miles in on my first pair, and I love them. They are super light, provide ample support and cushion, and I've felt noticeably faster in them. I don't know if it's mental or the carbon/nylon plate is really providing added propulsive effect, but it definitely feels like the shoe is almost rocking you forward. We'll see how they hold up over the next few hundred miles, but so far, I'm sold!",166161649

This is a pretty big downside, and may not happen if using a size above your true size.... apart from that, great shoe.",166024359

However, after my 2nd and 3rd 5 mile runs, I now have issues with my right inside ankle being really sore. I have a feeling this is because I'm most likely a heel striker and noticed some stability issues with the inside heel with the Zoom Fly. My normal running shoes are the Pegasus 33, so I'll be returning these and getting the Pegasus 34.",165713146
880848,5,07/06/2017,"Great shoe for track speed runs & races After running in Zoom Fly for a few days, it is clear that this shoe is not designed for uneven and trail surfaces. It shines on the track and, I presume, in a road race, where you can focus on your stride and technique to extract the maximum out of this shoe. On my last run on the track, after a few break-in runs, it started to come alive - I can actually feel the shoe forcing me forward, the plate inside obviously doing its job. Yet, the landings are not overly stiff - there is just enough cushioning in the heel and elsewhere to ensure your legs don't shatter with every step. Best part of the shoe, though, is the upper. Normally, when you run for the first time, you expect for something to go a little bit wrong or uncomfortable here and there, but with this shoe it didn't happen. I just laced up as I normally would, ran 15 km and didn't feel uncomfortable for a moment. Best of all - this shoe makes you think about your stride and technique. As it is aggressive, you get a sense that it wants you to also be focused when you are running - it is forgiving when you put your foot wrong or twist it a bit - but you also get a sense that it doesn't want to do that. Overall, serious shoe for some serious speed work on track and, of course, on your race day.",165669797
880848,5,07/01/2017,The next level I have tried and liked many brands of lightweight racing shoes and never really had a bad pair. What I do get is the odd pair from time to time that stand out from the rest giving you that extra bit of confidence on race day. Then the Nike Zoom Fly comes along and I have to say these have a total different feel to other lightweight racers Ive tried. My last pair was the Nike road racers and I loved these but as they were so light with minimal support I wouldnt chance a longer run in them. However these zoom fly are every bit as light on your feet and feel so supportive I feel I could wear them for any distance short or long. They have such a good feel on the ground I almost feel Im bouncing along the road. Always kept my racers for race day in the past but these can be used for either race or training. Very impressed with these,165161482
880848,5,07/01/2017,Amazing shoe I ran with these shoes 5 times and they make my run feel great and effortless. They are very responsive and light weight and I can go for miles with these shoes only downside for me is that I have a wide foot and wish there was a wide size for them.,165159769
880848,5,07/01/2017,"Great shoe So I'm not a full-on runner. I am trying to become more of a runner as I'm getting a little older. I'm 6'3"", 255 so I'm not light by any means. This shoe feels great on my size 13 foot. The placebo effect people say is not a placebo at all. Once I get into a stride I need to go faster than my normal runs. The shoe just wants to go fast. 

It does have great cushioning. As I said, I'm bigger but I have no issues with knee problems or anything that plague many bigger runners. The back of the heel does dig into your ankle, which I did not mind, nor did I notice once running. It did cause a blister after my first run so a good higher pair of socks should be worn as I was wearing no-show socks on the run.

I love the shoe. It feels great on my feet and the cushioning and the material seem durable. I am rotating between this and two other pairs of shoes so I know it will last me a little longer, plus I'm not a long distance runner. I am impressed.",165158306

When I put them on and jogged around in them the feeling of the shoe is great. I like how it rolls your foot forward, I like the weight of the shoe, the material used, and the foam had the right amount of cushion. However the sides of my feet (both the inside and the outside) hung off the sole of the shoe enough that when jogging it felt like I was running on the edge of the sole with about a quarter of my foot hanging off the edge. If you have even moderately wide feet these shoes are not designed for you, which really bums me out because I was very much looking forward to them.",165072703
880848,5,06/28/2017,"A Revolutionary Daily Trainer Although some of Nike's recent debut models have been lackluster, the Zoom Fly differentiates itself as a reliable, fast, and luxurious trainer. The Zoom Fly does an excellent job of balancing responsiveness and cushion. The thicker midsole and lunarlon foam do an excellent job of absorbing shock, while the nylon plate provides a nice ""springy"" pep with each stride. Unlike other maximalist shoes, the Zoom Fly does not feel too soft and heavy. Unlike other Nike models, the Zoom Fly's toe box is anatomically shaped and allows room for your toes to splay, thus improving your form and efficiency. I noticed that when compared to Nike's LunarEpic shoe, the Zoom Fly provides more stability, security, and response and faster paces. While the 10mm offset may seem like a lot for midfoot/forefoot strikers, I actually found it quite pleasant. The larger drop reduced the strain on my achilles and the heel does not feel clunky. Nike is headed in the right direction with the Zoom Fly; however, my only concern with this model is its longterm durability, as the midsole is already showing extensive creasing and wear.",164988048
880848,5,06/27/2017,"Great, fast shoes As a long time user of the Pegasus, I was intrigued to change things up and wanted to try the Nike Zoom Fly.

The first few walking steps are weird because of the shoe's structure (you feel your foot falling forward). However, a few minutes into the run and I felt comfortable.
I do not know how much is the shoe itself and how much is placebo, but I did feel the need to go faster by pushing on the tip of my feet at every stride.

I have been using the shoe about ten times so far: they are comfortable and do a good job.
I would recommend it to anyone looking to spice things up a little. I hope they last long given the price.",164637107

I figured I would give these a try to see how they'd roll through the paces and I have been pleasantly surprised at how great they feel. I love lighter-weight shoes but often that has come at the sacrifice of cushioning. This shoe is the perfect combo of both and I couldn't be happier. It definitely takes a little bit of adjusting to the different ride they offer but once you do these shoes just help you float across the miles.",164375363

No pain at all!The support is great too! Great lockdown from the flywire, but not so much that it cuts off circulation.My favorite aspect of the shoe is the Carbon-infused nylon plate!

The toe box had plenty of room and they felt extremely comfortable, just sad I will never get to find out for myself how good these shoes really are.

880848,5,06/16/2017,Best shoe in decades I have been running in Nike for over 25 years. I had the pleasure of running in these and they did not disappoint. These are hands down the best running shoes from Nike that I have worn. The fit is outstanding. The cushioning is really good (I am 180 pounds). These shoes make you run efficiently and lessen the impact on your legs. I love the footplate in the shoe as it propels you forward. I cannot believe that Nike put all of this into this shoe and it only weighs a few ounces. Please keep this shoe available. I will be purchasing another pair at the end of the summer. Well done Nike!,163927352
880848,5,06/16/2017,"Super! These are a breakthrough training shoe in all dimensions! They have a good fit, soft feel, with a snappy toe off, and they are fairly light. I have owned them since launch day and trained and raced in them for over 80 miles. Seem durable and well constructed- remind me of the original Clifton 1, which IMO has been replaced by inferior updates, and these Nikes fit me really well. Can't wait for the delayed Vaporfly 4s- but for training and some longer races you can run fast, have fun, and draw some attention! Go for it!",163924070
880848,4,06/16/2017,"Great shoes, need more widths These shoes perform as advertised. They are soft yet responsive, which is a difficult combination to achieve. Recommended if you have narrow-ish feet.

Weight-wise, they are light, but not super light. For comparison, I think the original Hoka Cliftons may have been a little lighter. Nike took out the weight from where it is mostly unnecessary, but kept it where it is needed for comfort and durability. 

The upper is extremely comfortable and I like the relatively unpadded tongue and flat laces which allow for lightweight comfort versus round laces that you tend to feel more across the top of your feet, thus requiring lots of padding (and weight) in that area.

The toebox is comfortable: wide enough and tall enough for me. The heel collar is padded enough - not over padded - just enough to be comfortable without adding weight. Again for comparison, the Clifton 1s were much more uncomfortable in the front foot.

The sole has harder rubber in high wear areas, so I feel durability will be good. Some small debris can get caught in the white foam area, but not as much as on the LunarGlides/Epics so perfectly acceptable.

My only gripe with this shoe is that the heel area is extremely narrow, so while the shoe fit me well in the front half, my heel was hanging out the inner side of the shoe. In other words, part of the inside heel of my foot was not resting on the sole of the shoe, but on the place where the sole meets the side. This, in turn, caused the shoe lo lean inward at an awkward angle, even when just standing and looking in a mirror from the back of the shoe.

I don't think this is a flaw with the shoe design, just my own foot shape. I think if the heel area were a bit wider, the heel would have fit right in the middle of the insole in a more normal manner. 

If these shoes are ever manufactured in a 2E I will try them again, because I did like the amount of cushion and the forefoot feel quite a bit. I particularly liked that even though they are cushioned, whatever hard plate is in them keeps them from feeling like you're running on marshmallows. In this respect, comparing again to the Clifton 1 (which I think is the closest feel to these of the shoes I've worn) the Zoom Fly is superior. The Clifton felt mushier that the Fly but the amount of shock absorption feels equal. The Fly felt less stable on the inside of the heel for reasons I mentioned above.

So you have an idea of where I'm coming from, I wore this pair for a six mile run. I'm a slow 8:30min/mile guy, my runs are usually 4-5 miles on weekdays with a 9-10 miler on the weekend (more if training for something) and have knee and ankle issues that always have me looking for cushioned shoes, but ones that you don't sink into. The sizing just didn't work for me.

Feel free to suggest your favorite cushy shoe based on the above!",163884988
880848,4,06/16/2017,"Almost... I just received my Nike Zoom Fly's yesterday and sadly will have to return them. The shoe is absolutely gorgeous and is very comfortable however it has the thin attached tongue (which I sadly didn't know before ordering) and I always avoid Nike's with this non-standard tongue as they usually cause irritation on my skin and I also find that the thin tongue doesn't hold my foot in place as well. Also, some other reviewers have contradicted each other on the width. The reason for this is (1) the area under the laces does indeed run narrow and ""hugs"" your foot but (2) the toe box is wide, actually too wide for my foot so another reason I am returning the shoes. Really disappointed as these look so cool and just love the style.",163828754

The shoes are a little more plush than im used to. I actually dont like the whole ultra cushion trend, but these work for some reason. 

I ordered the same size that i wear my Frees in, and it fits just fine. The weight is really light too, comparable to my normal regular runners. 

I was even able to shave 15 seconds per mile, running at the same heartrate, for 10 miles on my first run with these. I wasnt even paying attention to my pace the whole time! I only noticed it when I looked at my GPS watch at the finish.

Next mile 5:16...then ripped a 5:06...shoe performed absolutely flawless didn't even have to relace them once. Absolutely no fit issues. I'm pretty sure I could've run a marathon straight out of the box. 

 I can say I've been waiting for a shoe like this...for several years ....and I'm absolutely blown away. I've been a big fan of the 'tempo"" and lunar racer....but this shoe blows those out of the water.

I couldn't wait to run in them, so 20 mins after I was on the treadmill for a quick 25' test run and felt great, day after I did 10miles progression run and was another great feeling, especially when i started to bang those forefeet into the ground last 2 miles.
On the 3rd day went out for a 5k run and end up running 10k, today 4th day I own them and still feeling pretty excited about go out and run again!

The Pegasus is one of my favorite models to run in.

The lady that I spoke with was awesome with her help in trying get the shoes. They had my size NIKE ZOOM FLY But unfortunately the Nike Zoom Vaporfly 4% was unavailable because the shoe has been delayed for whatever reason. Though that was sad and all I was still amped on the NIKE ZOOM FLY, but I was destroyed as soon as I put them on. They were too narrow. And not by much but enough to know that they would have been uncomfortable if I would of tried to run in them. That being said with the exception of the width I could tell the should would have been a great shoe to run in.

They are very narrow and my toes are compressed.
I think they are ok for walking if you order the right size, but maybe not for running, unless you have a narrow foot it's better to pick a different model.
I hope Nike will add more width options, because I think these can be great shoes if sized correctly.",170338697

I ordered them again in a 9 (even though I am still waiting on my refund, so now I'm $300 out) and they're still narrow. I took them on a run today and the three right-most toes on my right foot started to go numb and the outer part of the ball of my left foot was tingly-numb the whole run. I'm incredibly disappointed. The shoes are very comfortable to walk in but the second I ran over a mile my feet began to go numb (probably from a lack of blood flow because the shoes are so narrow). 
I've never had such a terrible experience with Nike shoes. I haven't been able to find the Zoom Structure's that I like, which is why I've been trying out a new running shoe. 
I will be returning these shoes.",169640643

Many reviews say they run small so I went to Nike store to try them on rather than order online. Glad I did or I would have gone up a half size based on other reviews and they would have been too big. These shoes fit me the same as the Nike Flynit 2 which is what I was running in prior to trying these. I love how light they are and the outsole seems like it will hold up nicely (will know after a few more runs). The upper is very light and has a lot of give so does not put pressure on your foot where it shouldn't. I like the cut out in the tongue.... nice little detail that also eliminates a pressure point. I will definitely buy a second pair so I can rotate them. Oh, one last point.....I love the dark blue color, they are really nice looking.",167755989
897821,5,07/19/2017,"The take over. The Nike Zoom fly is a shoe that I would say beats out all of the competition. I say that because it really seems like a shoe that does exactly what you want. Imagine a shoe that has a very nice heel that is very cushioned, and the fore foot is so smooth that every stride seems to push you out further. Its impossible to not PR in a shoe like this. You can just stick to a normal runner. Nike did their things with this shoe. We all would like the elite versions but I just know that if this is where Nike is going with the technology. Wow... the takeover is approaching quickly",166569694
897821,5,07/12/2017,"New Love I was a little hesitant to order, since I have a knee injury coming back has been an absolute nightmare...by suggestion of my Dr who is also a runner, she recommended I try those other brands with the fat soles, but I told her I didn't want to seem like I was cheating on Nike. See, Nike and I have had a long term love affair for over 20+ years. I have twin boys and they only wear Nikes, and have been since the day they were born and they are almost 9 and one of them is in MEN size shoes (yes can you say I am BROKE) anyway...then I looked and saw Nike came out with these...I ordered them, at first I got a blister, but I think it was a combination of the sock with the shoe, it was a different sock I don't normally wear and the blister was where the sock met the shoe (if that makes sense) But since then I have not had a single issue, and when I wore that sock with another shoe, it did the same thing! 
They are a touch smaller than other Nikes, but that's okay. I usually order my running shoes a bit bigger, and this one fits PERFECT!!! 
Only issue I had was at the first wear, I got a blister, on the back, but its healed and when I went running again in them, it was fine.

Anyway...my knee didn't have one issue while running. The cushioning was amazing!
I have weird feet, and a jacked up knee so to find the right shoe, is imperative! And I most certainly did...I have found a new reason to love you Nike...you have done it again...I thank you, my knees thank you! I just want to know if these are going to come out in more fun colors!? Hook a sista up!! :)",166181272

I find the Zoom Fly to be a bit more comfortable than the Lunar Epic, although they are slightly narrow, which may be problematic for some people. I do have a slightly wide foot though and have not had issues. I feel the springy-ness of the shoe and I do tend to clock a few seconds per mile faster when I run these than my other shoes. I've taken them out for runs up to 15 miles and they have remained comfortable. I plan to run my fall marathon in them!",166163130
897821,5,06/26/2017,"Shoe Box to Marathon PR & BQ! I got these shoes the day after they were released after realizing the Vaporfly 4%s would be delayed. I raced my first Boston this year but had a poor performance, finishing in ~3:28. I vowed redemption and selected Grandma's Marathon for a come back just 2 months later. I did most of my training on Nike Pegs. I had purchased the Energy Boosts as a race pair in case I couldn't get the new Nike Vaporfly 4% in time. I settled for the Air Zoom Fly's. I did a 4 mile recovery run and a 3 mile shake-out run prior to racing in the Air Zoom Fly's at Grandma's Marathon. I love these shoes! While the fit is narrow, it is intentional and provides a snug fit while allowing your toes room to wiggle. I never had that shooting pain from mid-foot to ankle that I typically experience 20+ miles into the marathon. I did end up with very small blisters on the back of my heel, where the top of the shoe's heel touched my heel with each step, but didn't notice at all during the run. I also had my right shoe a bit too tight and had a small blister at the front of my ankle but again just because I tightened the laces too much in my opinion. I ended up racing 31 minutes faster than my Boston performance and also set a new PR by 3 minutes at 2:57! While I had trained for 6 months at this point, I still think the shoes helped, even if only by providing the proper cushioning I needed. I can't wait to try on the Vaporfly 4%!

I will try the Pegasus 34s.",164369499
897821,5,06/23/2017,"Great shoes! I mostly run in Nike Free shoes, but I wanted to try something different for long distance runs. I ended up ordering a 12.5, whereas I normally wear 12. These fit perfectly with a half size up. 

The shoe is incredibly comfortable, and honestly just fun to run in. They have a great deal of bounce to them which I am not used to coming from the Free series, but it is pleasant. I have been a minimalist runner for several years now but these shoes may have converted me back to padding. 

Previously when I used to wear padded shoes I would get shin splints like crazy. Relieving that issue is what drove me to the Free series in the first place. Since running with these Nike Zoom Fly shoes I have not had any pain or discomfort, so either I grew out of that particular issue or these are just really well designed shoes.

The shape and color are quite nice and I have received several compliments on them already. I would buy again, and I intend to get a backup pair just in case they get discontinued.",164332359

The thick midsole feeling strength but cushioning and shock absorb, There nylon-carbon plate inside midsole but I can't feeling it because seamless assembly and softness foam. How to compare this shoes with other Nike shoes? 1.The midsole that much softer than Vomero 12(The Most cushioning yet) 2.It's light weight as same as Racer shoes(Zoom Streak. & Flyknit Racer) 3.The upper wrap around foot very well and better than Pegasus 34. 
This is the best running shoes on the market this time for sure (or last til 8 July that Vapor Fly 4% will release) it fast enough for Raceday and durable enough for training or daily run . My suggest is ""Just leave other shoes and grab this! """,164158531

Insanely fast shoe and very comfortable. I have a wider foot, so much so that the LunarEpics were completely unwearable. These fit my foot like a glove in my normal size (11).

Try these shoes for some speed miles and you can't help but smile. I wouldn't say they're great for a slow, easy run, but that's not what they're meant for. Incredibly responsive and practically command your absolute best with every stride. Came back from my first run raving... and ready to buy a 2nd pair.",164045987

Now I am waiting for the size 38 or 7 to be delivered. The shoe is narrow but it does not bother me very much, what bothers me is running a half marathon and getting my feet wet because the shoe was created to support performance, but only in sunny weather. The sole could easily slip on wet surfaces. I would like an anti slip sole to a waterproof shoe and then I can say it was worth the investment. I woul not try to use these for racing, just for training. Plus, you cannot rate durability unless the shoe was intensely used  for at least one month - and it was put out for sale at the beginning of this month.",163927401
897821,5,06/16/2017,"Dream Running Shoe! WOW! I've been waiting for these shoes to become available since the beginning of this year, and they didn't fail to amaze me. Out of the many different shoes I've gone through since I started running these are by far the most comfortable and supportive. 

Immediately upon putting them on, I noticed how much more cushioned they feel. For those of you that prefer a firmer sole, this might not be the best option, but personally after having significant foot pain from some harder types of shoes, these felt amazing! I ordered up 1/2 a size to allow for foot growth--my suggested size was 9 1/2, but I went with the 10--and it gave enough room to allow for foot swelling, and worked perfectly during my hill workout. These are quite narrow compared to other shoes I have tried, but it worked great for my narrower foot. 

These came just in time for my second 5K time trial of this week, and I really felt like they propelled me forward, which was just what I needed to lengthen my strides a bit. They felt super smooth and supportive (even with my super high arch) and definitely fit closely to your foot shape. On my long run (15 miles), they continued to provide the perfect amount of support and stability throughout. Hopefully the cushioning will last for a bit.

The only con so far is that they were really hard to get on. Maybe it's just me, but I had to push and pull a bit to fit my foot in at first, whereas I can normally slide right into my other shoes, but once I got them on they fit perfectly.

Overall, I would definitely recommend these shoes, especially for those who like a very cushioned and responsive feel. I'll plan on using these for all of my road training this summer and during XC season as long as I don't grow out of it too fast! THESE ARE THE BEST!!!",163925923

897821,2,06/15/2017,"Great but not for minimal/neutral peeps I was one of the lucky kids that got to try the Vaporfly 4% beforehand and assumed the Zoomfly would feel similar, but they're entirely different animals. The Zoomfly's fit feels much more rigid and the shoe runs slightly narrow and almost a half size too small. If ordering I would default to a half size up to allow for foot swelling while running. As a neutral forefoot striker, i felt there was less support in the front crashpad and the ride wasn't the best. If you're a mid to heel striker these may work for you. Fans of the old Vomeros might also love these shoes, but for someone who runs 2+ hours in flyknit racers, this just felt too rigid and constrained for me. Keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get the Vaporflys and they'll be as I remembered though!",163788769

Opened the Box and they looked fab and felt good UNTIL I started running !!! 

They feel like your running with shoe boxes on your feet !!

1. They are Super Narrow across the midfoot,
2. Really Hard around the heel 
3. I run in the Nike elite socks but these are cut so high at the back that after only 2 miles they had torn the skin off the back of my heel and were digging into my achillies 
4. The tongue of the shoe also sits high and on an angle so this also digs in as you move your foot !

These look fantastic but Sorry Nike these are an Epic Fail for me ;(",163486877
897821,4,06/09/2017,"Good feel, less than great fit I made fun of the shoe endlessly, until I tried it on and actually kind of liked it - so much so that I bought it and took it on a maiden voyage yesterday. The shoe very much has a Hoka-y feel in that it very much rocks you forward. I just ran comfortably so I can't talk about it's responsiveness, but it did feel rather well cushioned and generally comfortable.

The negatives are isolated to the fit of the shoe. The shoe runs about 1/4 size small, is quite narrow throughout (not like the Pegasus that is narrow in the heel and midfoot and then ballooned in the forefoot, this shoe is narrow from heal to toe), and the upper is quite low depth. Great for some, not so much for me.

While I was considering using these as marathon racing shoes, due to the sizing issues I'll only be using it as a workout shoe. 

If you have narrow or low volume feet you will love this shoe. If not, I would recommend going to a store to try the shoe on before buying.",163469957

I have over 9 pairs of Nike's from Training to Running to Lifestyle. But nothing outdid my Winflo 2s. Any occasion running, going out, hanging around the Winflo model could not be beat by any other shoes i bought. the Winflo 3 took a total dump but this model brought it right back. Stellar feel, phenomenal look and at a unbeatable price. This shoe would be my first recommendation to anyone looking to buy Nike.",165715289
898476,5,10/08/2017,"A really comfortable running shoe. I've run over 100 miles in these and have already bought a second pair for when I retire the first pair. Super lightweight, running feels very natural, the neoprene soft back on these shoes makes these really comfortable.",172199521

In sizing they run a bit narrow and a bit short. I've worn a size 8 in Nike all my life, and in these I wish I had ordered the 8 1/2. Though the Air Max weigh more (and sometimes deflate), they are so much more comfortable than the Flex 2017 Run. I'd recommend the Air Max over these if you are looking for a comfortable run.",168623182
898476,5,08/03/2017,Love these shoes! Prior to buying these I had knee pain and had stopped running. In the short time I've had my Nike Flex 2017 running shoes I've been able to get back to running and my knees no longer bother me. These shoes are a blessing.,167810809
898476,5,06/30/2017,Amazing Ive been running since elementary school. Im in my late 20s now and have never strayed from Nike. So far out of the dozens and DOZENS of Nike running shoes Ive bought these are my favorite. I run over 30 miles a week and these hold up. They light enough that they dont hurt my ankles unlike a lot of other pairs Ive had. I cant rave enough about them. Ive never ran better or been happier with a purchase and consider they are about a hundred dollars cheaper than running shoes Ive bought Im REALLY happy. Just get them.,165121694

898485,4,09/14/2017,"Great fit! I bought these with the intentions of having to return them because I didn't think they'd work for me, but I'm surprised to say that these are great shoes for my needs. 

I have slightly wider feet, and I'd say I have slight pronation, so the free runs are a No Go for me and most other Nike shoes seem to run really narrow, especially in the toe box. I bought these in the standard width and they are actually roomy, but snug that they aren't allowing my feet to lose stability and the toe box is comfortable. The best part is the cushion, I run on a park track that is made of that rubber material so the bounce of that combined w/ the soles of the shoe are great, no more knee pain or shock to my shins. 

I've tried using these for HIIT workouts as well and for the cardio type exercises they're great, but when it comes to strength, the soles are so cushioned that it doesn't allow a flat, steady surface. Not a problem as these are intended for running. Lastly, I normally wear an 8.5 but i ordered a 9 and they are a tad too big, but with proper socks (not those thin messes that allow blisters) these shoes are the perfect fit without your toes beating against the front. Really glad I purchased and even more happy that I was able to stay w/ a brand I love!",169983372

898819,4,03/30/2017,Thank you Nike for creating shoes to fit over AFOs I love the fact that NIKE now offers 2 different style FlyEase shoes in kids sizes. My 7 year old son wears hinged AFOs (dafo tami 2) that can be very difficult to fit into a pair of shoes. Hes worn braces since he was 14 months old so Im a pro at searching for and trying out all different types of shoes. The FlyEase running shoe is awesome! My son is learning to put on his own shoes and these make it possible. A couple of suggestions. 1) make them just a few cm wider through the middle/top section. 2) Remove the stretchy/bungee type laces and replace with a toggle style lace so the shoe can be  opened  wider and stay wide to make it easier for a child to slide an AFO into it.  We can work with them and use as is and my son loves his new Nike shoes. These are pretty awesome and with a couple minor adjustments they would absolutely perfect. Thank you Nike!!!!!,156470573
898819,5,02/22/2017,"This has been a game-changer for my son! I highly recommend the Fly Ease series to all who may struggle with the fine-motor skills it takes to tie shoe laces.

We just bought him a second pair because he's grown out of the first. Thank you, Nike for developing this line!",152066842

904252,5,09/22/2017,"NIke Flex 2017 RN This past July I was able to purchase the Nike Flex 2017 RN and truly it was a great decision that I made. If you are on your feet throughout the day look no elsewhere than the Nike Flex 2017 RN. I have found over my lifetime that the best shoes based on durability, comfort and water resistance come from Nike Brand Shoes like the Nike Flex 2017 Rn. These shoes are ideally fit for people standing throughout the day or even people who are active long-distance runners. I base my criteria for judging shoes on four main areas. They are durability, comfort, water resistance, and breathability. I think these four main ideas are critical for assessing shoes to be purchased and worn every day.

Durability: 
The Nike Flex 2017 RN are very durable despite its lightweight nature. These shoes are very light but have very good strength and resistance to wear and tear. I like these shoes because of them being a multi-purpose shoe. They are suitable for running and walking as well as working out in gyms. They hold up well when doing various types of activities like running or playing sports. 

Comfort: 
The Nike Flex 2017 RN are the ideal shoe for people who like comfort. They are a low shoe that doesn’t ride up ankles and shins like basketball shoes. They are easy to fall in love with if you are walking long distances. My own personal experience is walking at the state fair and not having any issues with climbing up hills, even though I only had the shoes for a month. These shoes were very reliable and I felt comfortable throughout the whole entire day at the fair.

Water Resistant and Breathability: 
When it comes to water resistance, these shoes pass the test. Not a lot of tennis shoes are able to keep out water very well. These shoes have a protective layer on top which I believe helps with keeping moisture out. Breathability is also an important task when assessing shoe value. I also like how these shoes are put together. I know for myself that having moisture in the shoes which limits breathability, allows the athlete’s foot to set in. I have had athletes foot problems in the past, but I haven’t had any since I bought the Nike Flex 2017 RN

Negatives: 
If I had one negative about this shoe it would be treadwear. It seems like this shoe has problems with keeping the tread on the bottom of the shoe. I have had problems in the past with Nike Shoes with overall tread. I have had better traction with Cowboy Boots than tennis shoes!!! 

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Nike Flex 2017 RN are an excellent shoe choice to purchase for various activities, whether it be running or even walking, these shoes pass the test. These shoes are very reliable in everyday strenuous activity!",170247454

After moving to other shoes over time, I decided to come back to what helped me in the beginning. It was the right and easy decision to make.

904701,5,11/21/2017,"4 years of loyalty to this shoe. If you are looking for just style, then you are looking in the wrong place. This shoe and I have had a relationship these last four years, and I have never been disappointed. I partly give this credit to the fact that I knew what I was looking for in a shoe: amazing arch support that lacks in the pegasus, cushion on the heel for my over pronation, and a thin sole by the toes to be able to dig in for my sprinting workouts. Its a tighter fit, so go a a half-size up since if you train in them your feet naturally swell and you do not want to regret getting too tight of shoes. 

Overall, this is the shoe I search for and will forever be a fan of. Nike out-did themselves in this shoe.",176234203
904701,3,11/13/2017,Not what I expected Way too big: order a half-size smaller than your normal Nike size. Very stiff out of the box & not very comfortable for the brand (I'm used to Nike Free Runs).

Big fan of the LG line over the years and one of the 50% or so it seems who thought the 8 - whilst quite a change - was a great progression.Bought the 9s and pretty much feels exactly like the 8s to run in. In my opinion the changes from the 8 are hardly improvements though.. the upper seems closer to a flyknit than the fly -mesh though disappointingly not entirely, and not sure why the heel counter has been changed - not as good as the previous model and looks weird/ cheap and glossy like the back of a school shoe in the black/ grey model. Aesthetically overall a step back I feel. Still a good shoe though",170251124

904716,1,10/22/2017,"It's like a shoe you can't unlace I've worn Lunarglides for years, they were my go-to casual sneaker. But this new version doesn't work for me.

The main problem is that the sides of the tongue have now been sewn to the side of the shoe. There's no elastic. It's not like a slip on elasticized shoe. It's just like the shoe has been sewn closed. You can loosen the laces, but the tongue won't move.

We've all taken OFF sneakers that are laced closed, right? But try putting one ON like that. No matter how thin my sock, or how much slack I try to pull out around my toes, this shoe now pulls my sock back tight around my toes, and bunches it up in the heel. Yesterday I walked around all day and ended up with blisters on the tips of my toes because of the way this shoe pulls my socks.

They've also changed the arch support in this model so that it's either higher than it was previously, or in a slightly different position. My feet were in such pain because of this that by the end of the day I pulled off these shoes and literally threw them across the room.

I'm now going to spend way too much money to buy the one last pair of Lunarglide 7s in my size on Amazon, because I need a pair of sneakers that won't cripple me. And Lunarglide 9s aren't it.",175097834

The shoe is extremely narrow & painful to wear. I tried running in them once & felt as if my feet were slapping the concrete. The arch is not aligned to the foot, seems too far back. And the outside of the mid-foot area is not ""hugged"", it is rather annoying lifted/tilted. I tried with an insole and it didn't improve...made it more tight and uncomfortable. 
Going back to the competitors product, there is no comparison with the boost provided.

I use them for road running, trail running and circuit training (body weight) - don't use them for weight lifting/crossfit. 

I found the shoes are a lovely fit and the new ones are no different, they felt perfect and Nike certainly haven't changed that winning formula. The most noticeable change is the looks. I found the older ones look a bit clunky and a bit dorky - built for comfort rather than looks. But the new ones look so much nicer than their predecessor, the minimalistic approach works a lot better for me, with the all black exterior and reflective strips on the back with an orange border, they seem to look a lot more refined. With the added water repellent fabric only adds to the list of pro's rather than con's.

Walked in the rain a couple of times now with my new NIKE AIR ZOOM PEGASUS 34 SHIELD and both times had water infiltration. Not sure if the new 'shield' technology is just 'resistant' but can't handle a couple miles in a downpour or if I maybe just got a Monday pair.

Theres also no printed name inside the sole of the shoe which state VaporMax on the kids to the ones in the womens section.",176660692

918021,5,09/12/2017,"Great Shoe This shoe is awesome. My son loves it. I actually bought 2 pair. Just buy a pair you will not regret it!

 The only thing I would ask Nike would look in to making a FlyEase cross training shoe.",169948312
918021,5,09/07/2017,"Amazing! I purchased this shoe for my 10 year old daughter with cerebral palsy. It has been an enormous challenge for many years to find a cute, stylish shoe that will also fit well with her AFO's! I cannot begin to tell you how thankful I am for the FlyEase!! They have changed our life! I am highly recommending them to all parents who's children require AFO's! Thank you Nike for making our lives a little brighter....and a lot more stylish!! Bring on some more colors, we will own them all!!",169819684

AA1622,5,08/28/2017,"Want more colors I love the Nike free RN commuter. I did have to get a half size bigger but I think nikes in general run small because my other pair of nikes are the same way. These shoes though in particular are very comfortable and the color is so beautiful. I want want them in more colors. I cant wait to put them to the test with a work out, but so far with walking around they are pretty durable and like I said before comfortable!",169553169
AA2430,5,08/08/2017,"Great shoe runs small As other people have said the shoe runs small however my favorite thing about the shoe is the laces that it features. I want to buy more of the laces but can't find where I can get them, if anybody knows please comment, thanks.",168270939
AA2430,4,08/01/2017,"Awesome Shoes but order a half size up These shoes look amazing and are super comfortable. I love that I can use these for the gym, casually, or a night. Just a great all around shoe.

Only reason I docked it a star is because they do run small (Im usually an 11.5, but 11.5 here was too tight on me, returned and ordered a 12 and these fit perfect now).",167725401
AA2430,3,07/29/2017,"Look cool, but run very small These shoes look great, but they are really small. I ordered a size 10, which I wear in everything. But got these and they were REALLY tight. You should order a 1/2 size up",167556150
AA3172,5,10/23/2017,"The Road Runner! ..."" beep beep""... Nike outdid themselves again! 
I am seeing same revolution as in 2005 with Nike Free and then in 2013 with Nike Free update which I was lucky to get my hands on. 
Since then I ran in Nike Free 5.0 around 750km, primary on asphalt and just a two years ago I retired those shoes and bought another Nike with their innovative component the Flyknit 3.0 - excellent shoes due to so much comfy upper, however running 10k and up is where I notice these shoes are not for breaking records or long runs. 
Unfortunately Nike wasn't releasing the perfect mix (at least to my individual preference) until Nikelab Fly SP came out - oh boy! once put on, you could feel these the perfect race shoes. 
The shoes are designed so well, that not only they are even more comfortable than Flyknit 3.0, but perform so much better. 
Flyknit 3.0 are shoes that will go with the flow, so if you are running low on energy Flyknits would just kick back and you find yourself in slow pace which is hard to pick up from as the shoes itself are not racers, but great for training and easy paced short distance. 
The Nikelab Fly SP are total opposite and you don't even get the chance to slow down because they just keep you moving forward - motivation itself as once you pick up the pace (almost immediately) you don't want to slow down and unless you stop completely these won't let you slow down. 
Alright, enough talking, here are the facts: 
I ran since 2013, my 5K PR was in 2013 in 2017 I moved to USA, which made it harder for me to adapt to the temp, air and so on and so I didn't train as much nor seen improvements.
Bought these two weeks ago ran in them 5 times and WOW broke my PR on 5K and 3K plus keeping my pace at 4.40/km from 5.15/km in Flyknit or Free 5.0. 
Very glad to see Nike taking research seriously and it's not just a hype to market their product. 
For those considering these as serious runners shoes - go for it. 
For those considering these as a fashion accessories/ addition to your shoe rack - pass on these. 
For the first time I see a company to make one purpose shoe and I am glad its done by my most favorite brand Nike. If you wonder about the size, these are identical to fit size of Free 5.0 or Flyknit 3.0.",175098867
AA3172,4,10/17/2017,nice looking and comfortable This lab SP is probably better for wearing as sneakers. it looks very nice on street. I would go for another pair zoom fly or 4% which is better for real running. I like it very much.,173775991
AA3172,5,10/15/2017,"Fly Hybrid This taupe is dope! I’ve had the regular zoomfly and now these. I like these better, because the upper is more like a Vaporfly, with the soft heel and hidden Flywire. These also weigh a half ounce less than the regular zoomfly. I can’t claim that they make me faster, but I can say my legs stay fresher longer. I will be wearing more of these in the future and recommend them to anyone. Because these seem to be a mix of the zoomfly and Vaporfly, I would call them a hybrid between the two.",173683289

AA4080,5,10/10/2017,"Incredible I have very flat feet, I have no arch what so ever they look like feet shaped pancakes! I have been looking for a workout shoe that gives me great arch support, stops my right foot from turning in, good stability, hard bearing, but also allows me to move. I do a lot of zumba and dancing so I need to be able to slide across the floor. I know they are meant for running, but I have yet to find a gym shoe that has good arch support. These shoes tick all the boxes Im looking for and more. Furthermore they have also help correct my posture. They have helped to tuck in my pelvis to a more neutral position and I am no long so wonky on my right side due to my over-pronation . They are to me a miracle shoe. I have worn them for five days in and out of the gym and all I can stay is INCREDIBLE. I may just have to buy a few more pairs in different colours. Thank you Nike.",173234928
AA4080,5,09/06/2017,"Great shoe these are my go to pair for style and comfort. they're also the best when practicing on turf for a sport (when you're not using cleats), highly would recommend to anyone looking for something clean, in style and affordable",169801433

The last mile or so I noticed a loss of pressure in the air pocket of my left shoe. After further inspection I found that the air max portion of the shoe had in fact popped. I really appreciated the design and comfort of the Air Max Fury, however they are they are fragile and delicate.",169923236
