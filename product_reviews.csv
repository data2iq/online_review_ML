1,04/10/2017,These shoes look nothing like the picture! I expected a grey color...they aren't grey at all..more like cream..I'm so disappointed that I spent so much money on a pair of shoes that I hate and can't return.,,4002178_W
1,02/26/2017,I ordered this shoe because i loved the displayed blush pink color. However when I ordered them they came out much more of a neon salmon color and it was nothing like I expected. I would have never ordered the shoe if the online color was portrayed more accurately. I'm very dissapointed. The neon of the shoes don't totally show up in the picture i took but you can still tell it is far off from the online sample.,color sample was way off,4002178_W

1,07/30/2017,"I got all black with white soles and they look very nice, I have gotten a lot of compliments on them. But I am very disappointed with the quality for how much I paid. The soles are much bigger than represented and for some reason the sole of my right shoe makes a loud squeak and it will not go away!! It's like it starts sticking to the ground and squeaks. Idk how to fix it! If anyone knows how to please reply.",Too bulky & squeaky,4002179_W

3,12/01/2017,"The shoes were great the shock red on my computer looked red, but in person looks more pink.  Worn once and boxed them back up.

2,06/07/2017,"I ordered these to wear in the Pride Parade because I always wear Adidas in the parade. I ordered gold metallic stripes and a gold metallic tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar 80s. Somehow they made a manufacturing error and put the Black Gold tongue logo that is only available on the Superstar RTs. Also, the personalized engraving is so faint it's barely visible. Hopefully, Adidas will rectify this situation for me and then I will revise my review. But even then, I will never have a new pair on time to wear in the Pride Parade.

4,04/06/2017,"The shoe is pretty much exactly what I wanted. The problem I have though (and it's a pretty big one to me) is, the monogram is much smaller than shown and barely visible.

4,01/20/2017,"Nice. I do love the ""Scarlet"" color. However, not a huge fan of the toe matching the base. It doesn't quite look right, and the difference in materials seems to be the reason. I love the chunky, rounded aesthetic of the toe, but personally, I wish the toe material matched the base material for a more uniform look. This is probably fine if you prefer to keep the toe linked to the outsole, and not the base as I wanted to.",,4002435_W
3,01/19/2017,theres not enough colors to choose from and why can't i get the tounge logo to match the stripes? plus the stupid nickname,"what about purple, yellow, orange, green or any other colors",4002435_W

5,06/22/2017,"I customised my own to match with my kit. It has my name in them too which I like. The main problem was picking the width, I contacted Adidas for advise and guidance on this and after a short period of conversing, they said they don't have a guide. I opted for the medium ones. These are really good, light and quick trainers, I am looking forward to racing in these.

5,08/05/2017,I use these shoes for indoor use and they have great traction and surprisingly good support. I use them to play racquetball and have loved them.

The tiniest bit of water will leave nasty brown marks in the shoe. These shoes are awesome, comfy, and only reflect on the back tab.

2,02/24/2017,I am a size 13 and thought about using the 15% deal on your birthday so I bought a pair of the alphabounce HPCs and was not very impressed when I tried them on and they were too big and too wide for my foot and I have a fairly wide foot so I'm going to try a 12.5 and hope they fit like 13s.

4,08/18/2016,"I would say these shoes aesthetically look amazing! I'm a Personal Trainer and found these shoes to be uncomfortable after 2 hours of use. My feet starting to get sore, I do have flat feet so that doesn't help. I only use them for walking purposes as I'm back and forth in the gym. These shoes are meant for running so just for that type of use they would probably be amazing as they have a really nice firm bounce/response to them.
If you are looking for a nice looking shoe, def would recommend these. In terms of wearing them for hours on end, I don't think they will fill the role of a ""comfort shoe"".","Would recommend for running, aesthetics but not for hours of walking.",GIV93
4,08/17/2016,It looks really nice and is really versatile meaning that you can wear it casually as well as to work out.,It isn't ultra boosts but it's not a trashy shoe either.,GIV93
2,08/12/2016,Ultra boost is still the best. I don't like the fit of the shoes because I have a wide foot.,Ultra boost is better,GIV93
5,08/11/2016,Great shoes! I thought the colour was more white as in the pictures but it turned out to be a little on the grey side. Should have read the Colour details.,So comfortable!,GIV93
5,08/11/2016,Great shoe. Very comfortable. Haven't worn for running as I stick with energy boost but I recommend as a lifestyle or gym shoe. More colourways needed though,Perfect day to day shoe,GIV93
5,08/07/2016,one of the best purchased i have i a long time. Good buy.,The shoes is comfy to run with.,GIV93
4,08/06/2016,"People with slightly wider feet may want to go a half size up as these shoes are very snug and wrap around your foot for a secure sock like fit, overall it is a good comfortable shoe with good support with amazing cushioning from the Bounce material in the mid-sole. The mesh on the upper feels very soft to the touch and seems thick enough for it to be durable. However, as this has a material which appear to be hard to clean once it gets dirty so I would recommend applying some protective spray on it to keep it looking fresh!",,GIV93

4,09/27/2016,"I have been an adidas customer for quite some time and you guys continue to give us great products. Pure boost, ultraboost, stan smith, and now the alphabounce. Great shoes. I just wish I could get my hands on a pair of yeezy boost, it is very difficult to secure a pair due to the popularity and people using ATC services. I would love to add those shoes to my collection of great adidas products. I used to wear other brands and now I strictly wear the three stripes.",Adidas comfort is unmatched.,GUA47
5,09/27/2016,"Comfortable and great looking shoes. Had some pain from the left shoe rubbing against ankle joint that lasted four days until the shoe stretched out. I've decided that it's not a serious problem and it may have just been that one shoe. Overall, I'm very happy.",,GUA47
5,09/27/2016,They are so comfortable! And they look so good!! Overall a killer sneaker!!,Solid Purchase!!,GUA47
5,09/25/2016,I use this shoe for work since I'm on my feet all day and it's perfect. Usually I buy a different brand of shoe and it usually takes a few days to break in and these were comfy straight out the box! I will never buy anything but alphabounce for work.,Comfort is unbelievable,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,Very stylish. Everyone at my school thought they were cool. Very comfortable for about 12 hours then you start to feel the pressure on the side of your foot and the ball of your foot. The grip on the bottom of the shoe wears away a bit but other than that they are pretty durable and underrated.,Definetly worth the price.,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,Some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn for working out. These shoes are not stiff. They are very flexible and allow your feet to bend naturally in any way. This makes them perfect for running.,Extremely flexible shoes.,GUA47
5,09/24/2016,"The overall appearance is stealth-like. I purchased the all black pair. They look terrific. I run 12 in Nikes and I know Nike runs a bit big so I got 11.5 for Adidas. The shoes fit incredibly snug. The safari print is very subtle so it does not look too girly. 

I am taking one star off because of the neoprene material they used. Neoprene as a material similar to that of a surf suit. I've just had the pair a week, but I feel it is a type of material that will fade in the sun and get frayed when I am doing more of my intensive workouts. 

Again, the shoe is amazing as a whole. I am just a little weary of the top portion material choice. 

Lastly, Adidas, make these in Orange, or Red, or military colors. They'd look AMAZING!",Stealthy and aggressive look,GUA47
5,09/23/2016,"Besides the amazing fresh new design , the comfort is amazing. I own some of the Ultra boosts and although the bounce doesn't have Boost , it's really up there in terms of the comfort.

5,09/23/2016,Best runners i have ever bought. They are comfy and great for work!,Best runner in my opinion. Planning on buying another pair.,GUA47
5,09/23/2016,What a great running shoe for the price ! This is what the ultra boost should have been. The Alphabounce is a real comfortable shoe with nice rebound. These are  a more firm feel compared to any shoe with the Boost material but they have a good feel of their own. The upper seamless material is very comfortable. Not as restrictive as the techfit in the 1st and 2nd gen energy boost and not as tight as the ultra boost. It has just the right amount of secure and firm snug fit with out restricting the movement of your foot and it has a better vent system as well. I have 3 pairs of Alphabounce each in a different color,Excellent value !!!,GUA47

5,09/11/2016,"I have long been a serious adidas fan and when I saw this shoe I had to try it. I wanted this shoe as a runner and a trainer and it did not disappoint. I've always used adidas specialty shoes for fencing using their fencing specific shoes for fencing training and competition. As a fencer and runner I put a lot of abuse on my feet so I always look to adidas for footwear. This she is excellent not just for its low price tag but for any shoe of any price. The support is perfect for me and the responsiveness and bounce I find to work well for me. A great shoe loved it so much I bought two pairs, one in the hard to find core black/crystal white aramis dot pattern and one in the core black metallic silver. I don't wear this as a lifestyle shoe but as a functional runner and trainer and even use for fencing practice. For me this shoe is simply excellent.",LOVE THIS SHOE!!,GUA47

4,09/08/2016,Great sneakers! They run about a 1/2 size big but they are extremely comfortable. I like the style of the shoe and I can't wait for other color ways. My only issue with the shoe is that the material gets dirty really quick. I chose the grayish color and I have so many stains on them from running.

5,08/31/2016,"Head turner out of the box. I wore them to a performance in a room full of people and I got stopped 10 times before I could reach the stage. People wanting to know what kind of shoes they were, where did I get them, did the store have any more. The whole nine. My drummer took one off of my foot to get a closer look.

5,08/28/2016,"I'm a size 11, but I decided to try the shoes in a size 10.5. To my surprise the shoes actually ""adapted"" to my foot. I could wear these all day, in fact I already do. These shoes are perfect for everyday life and running.","Great product, would reccomand to anyone.",GUA47

I saw 2 Chainz rocking them at the NBA Finals and had to get my hands on a pair. finally found a color way that spoke to me with the grey combo. These are legit running shoes, but stable enough for training and lifting. Overall super versatile because I wear them casually and get a lot of compliments.",Sneaker of the Year.,GUA47

5,08/21/2016,These are some of my favorite shoes right now! They are super comfortable and I can wear them casually even if I'm walking long distances.

And the best part is they look beautiful in pictures but even better in person,Can't believe they're only $100,GUA47

5,08/15/2016,"I've only had them a week or two. Mostly wear them in the gym, not outside. They're very comfortable and the neoprene seem to absorb  the sweat then, it seems to evaporate. Love the bouncy cushion. Great for running reducing impact on ball of the foot. Conforms nicely to your feet for great support.",So far so good. We will see how they hold up.,GUA47
5,08/15/2016,Great product especially for the price great quality mesh and a very comfortable shoe very underrated love the colorway too,One of the most underrated comfy shoes,GUA47
5,08/14/2016,"My experience with sneakers have always been the classic chunky cross trainers or running shoes. I decided to try something different and am so glad I did.

These shoes have helped me get back into exercising. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra bounce in your step but with hardly any weight. These were perfect for me to jog in, but also to wear to boxing where I found traditional sneakers too bulky.

These are now also my casual sneaker of choice because of how comfortable they are, plus I have gotten heaps of comments about how great they look (they look even better on person than in the pictures).

This is my first purchase with Adidas, and will definitely be my brand of choice from now on. I'll probably upgrade these when my running gets more serious (not sure about their support for long distances), but they are perfect for me now both for fitness and casual wear.

Fit true to size, I have quite wide feet and they fit me perfectly (US 13), for reference if I buy Nike I sometimes have to go the size up.",Redefined sneakers for me,GUA47
4,08/13/2016,I love this product but why it write made in china,Best purchase,GUA47
5,08/11/2016,I was in need of some running sneakers and these sneakers met my expectations and more. Very comfortable as well.,Comfortable and stylish sneaker.,GUA47
4,08/10/2016,This was a very good product I just advise not to expect boost like comfort. Its comfortable I just hoped that with the NMDs and Ultraboost that the Alphabounce would use that new comfort tech. Neverthe less worth it and fits like a sock,Perfect shoe for the price,GUA47

4,08/02/2016,"Super comfortable sneakers, comparable to that of ultra boosts but for half the price!
Having narrow feet, I was worried about the neoprene-like upper being too wide or buckling when tightening the laces; but not a problem!  I can pull the laces as tight as possible but no bunching occurs and the shoes remain supportive, comfortable and no loss of performance.

The relatively flat profile of the sole lends itself to being more of a casual or training shoe.  I found the curved sole of the ultra boost uncaged particularly conducive to running and following my natural stride.   

Length fits true to size (despite other reviews suggesting they run a bit large) for me. 

Core black colourway is minimalist sleek ... but hopefully we get the ""Aramis"" black/white patterned drop here in Aus!!",Perfect fit & comfort even for narrow feet,GUA47

3,07/22/2016,I'm not the biggest fan of these shoes after my purchase. I really like the way they look and how comfortable they are. I did not however expect them to be as heavy as they feel.

3,07/18/2016,Light & Comfortable but the mesh material stretches so the sneakers do not stay as tight as I like them to be and they aren't water repellent. just a little bit of water and your feet get soaked.,,GUA47
5,07/17/2016,"These alpha bounce shoes are very comfortable and lightweight. I bought a men's 8 since that's what I have in other adidas and I thought they might be a little too big at first, but after breaking in they're great.",Best shoe ever!,GUA47
5,07/17/2016,"This is such a great shoe for many reasons. Firstly the design is what attracts people but it is so much more. The shoe fits like a glove, the interior grips your foot perfectly almost like a sock and feels very stable and firm on the feet.

4,07/10/2016,"The fused upper mesh is actually more of a neoprene material and is one solid piece that does hug your foot like a sock. It's comfortable, but doesn't breathe much. I bought these for work use, not running. As an everyday shoe, they are excellent and comfortable. I'm on my feet 10+ hours a day and they are perfect for long shifts.

5,07/09/2016,Great shoe at a great price. Very comfortable and stylish. They do run a little big I'd say about a half size. Try them on if you can. I wear a 14/15 and wish I got the 14 instead of the 15 but they still fit well with a little wiggle room. Not really sure how they perform because I have them for casual use at the moment. Would buy 5 more pairs without a doubt. More colors soon please adidas! Great job as always.,Best bang for your buck,GUA47
5,07/08/2016,"Great shoe, I usually wear 13, these in 13 fit great with just a smidge of extra room in the toe. I have narrow feet so the width is good for me, could be tough on a wide foot.

4,07/02/2016,"The Alpha Bounce is the first pair of adidas I have purchased in several years. After I stopped rocking shell toes I started collecting nike exclusively. I decided on the Alphas after seeing 2 chainz rocking a pair in Game 5 of the Finals. I purchased a 10.5 online and they are still sitting in the box they came in. I tried on a pair of 10s in store and realized the 10.5 is probably a half size too big. I chose the solar purple colorway and I love the look! I'm sure when  I finally wear them out they will receive great reactions. I loved the fit in store and the bounce was super comfortable. I don't have to tell anyone that the price on these is ridiculously affordable and I think I may grab another colorway before adidas decides to match nikes presto prices at 120! Grab a few pair of these while you can, they are great summer shoes and perfect for a early morning or late afternoon run!",The price point is honestly the best part of these shoes.,GUA47

4,07/01/2016,"Good entry level running shoe. Adidas had me at $100! its definitely stylish and wearable besides just being a running shoe. Initially the forefoot cushioning feels great but as you get passed that, while running the lack of flexibility becomes an issue (if you crave a flexible runner this is probably not for you). Lastly get your true size, I went a half size up thinking they'd fit like ultra boost and I was wrong. The lack of heel support (locked in heel) in large part due to that 1.5 centimeter difference made for sloppy heel play during my run. Im beginning to think wearing my true size would make a difference in the overall performace of the shoe. These are 6/10 for Perfromance (not a heavy usage runner in my opinion) and an 8 of 10 in terms of style. Many thanks adidas!",Good bang for your buck shoe!,GUA47
5,07/01/2016,"It's a really clean looking shoe and it is very comfortable.

It's cushion is just like the name says 'bounce'.

I love the look and most importantly the comfort of the boost midsole. I tried NMD’s and the Supernova’s as well, but the Ultra Boost is what has healed my heel pain! I have heard great things about the EQT Support 93/17’s, BUT they don’t make those for women. I do wish Adidas would make those for women so I could get a pair to try! Hint hint! I am thankful they make the Ultra Boost though and I give them a 10 out of 10! I don’t run but I walk a lot and can be on my feet all day and not feel any discomfort, so thank you Adidas!! Boost is life!",Most comfy shoe ever!,BEV86
4,11/10/2017,"It is a very comfortable soft shoe. Slightly bulky, and the laces have a small ""surface area"" on the top. The top is like a sock and the cage is supportive but not as much as I thought, the shoe was too wide for my foot, they run large. I went with the pure boost instead and I prefer it over the ultraboost! I would recommend both shoes!",Great purchase!,BEV86
5,11/06/2017,"It's probably the best sneakers I've purchased so far. It's very soft and great for running or just walking in daily life. I like them so much and then my mom got those, too.

5,10/24/2017,"I have never owned a pairs of adidas in my life, and after having MANY MANY MANY years of feet pain, I have decided to invest in a pair of shoes that will do my feet pain some justice. I have walked a lot in many places like in amusement parks, traveling, school, walking even in my own neighborhood, and by the end of the day, the heal and the center of my feet sting like CRAZY. I do not have flat feet but a very small arch, which contributes to the pain. I would have to massage my feet in order to sleep properly, it's just that bad. Now, after some serious investigating and researching, I have concluded that the adidas ultraboost was the way to go. The reason why I researched these shoes so much is because I never have dropped so much cash in one pair on shoes in my life. I finally decided to order them two weeks ago, and ordered a 7.5 and 8 because a lot of people said to half size down and others said stay true to size. 7.5 reached my toes exactly and after trying on my 8, I noticed the center of my foot was being suffocated. It was perfect in size but too tight in the center. I ended up returning the 7.5 and kept the 8. I ordered an 8.5 (which by the way, took longer than expected to arrive....) and they finally arrived today! I put them on and immediately fell in love. The center of my foot was not suffocating and I felt super comfy in my bouncy shoes that curve to the shape of my foot. I ripped that tag off and officially called them mine. I can't wait for the comfort I am going to feel. I do not run but I do walk a lot. I will be using these these as a daily shoe. If you know you walk a lot or are just on your feet for a very long time, I recommend these shoes. I also remember reading that these shoes squeak a lot, the first two pairs I ordered did squeak a lot!! But the one that arrived today does not squeak, at least on tile. My last recommendation: If you KNOW you have wide feet, I recommend you 1/2 size UP! These are my very first pair of adidas shoes in my whole life. I am looking towards buying another pair soon, gotta be stylish and comfortable!",MY very first Adidas shoes!,BEV86

5,09/28/2017,"Adidas ultra boost is a great shoe. It is really comfortable in the fact that it has boost but also because it supports our feet really well. I have a flat foot and with normal shoes, I got to wear a kind of plating so that it doesn't hurt my feet but with these shoes, without it I could still walk pretty well. I would recommend these but if you think that it's kind of pricey you should go with pure boost or nmd but it should be the R2 because it is way softer than R1. If you really want ultra-boost just wait until it's on sale. Overall this is the most comfortable shoe with great design I've ever worn in my life.",This is a great shoe.,BEV86

Perhaps the sizing is off on other sizes, but I think if you're the same shoe size as me, ordering a 5.5 should be good enough. It matches what the sizing chart says of it being 22.5 cm, so if you're REALLY unsure, measure your foot!

I always wear a size 9 and the9 was ludicrously big and the toe portion was so wide I felt that downsizing wouldn't help. The arch was in the wrong place for me- but if the sizing works for you, I can see how the soles would be cushiony and comfy.

They told me no, to order true to size. So I did, and it was WAY too big. Now I have to return them and they no longer have the size I need.

1,04/05/2017,"At first when I bought my Boost Ultras I was as happy as could be. They are light, the have great arch support, and feel amazing when I went on runs. But after a short while I realized how poorly they are actually made.
 Within a week the paint of the ultra boost logo scratched away. This was nothing in my mind. But after two months the knitting on the sides of the shoes were quickly begining to tear and stretch out. I would like to point out that I am not an avid runner, so most of the use of these shoes was just from walking. 
Other issues I have had with the shoes include the cheap insoles on in the shoe. Whenever I actually did run on my Ulta boosts, they would bunch up almost instantly, causing discomfort. This happened so often that I opted to just take them out permanently. Out of all of these issues, these are the least of my concerns.
My biggest gripe about these shoes is the lackluster sole on the bottom of the shoe. It is so incredibly thin and wears away so easily. Within 4-5 months they were worn down to the boost foam in some areas. Again 90% of the use of these shoes was just walking and not even running​. Now, by the 9th month of having these shoes, the rubber sole is peeling apart and both of my shoes are torn practically all the way through the shoe near the front where the shoe should naturally bend when running. I really enjoyed these shoes when I first had them, but the are definitely not worth the hefty price for how short the last.",Low quality shoe that is not worth the insane price.,BEV86

2,02/21/2017,"I love the ultra boost line and the uncaged variant. I really like this colourway too. However, the pair of shoes that I received shouldn't (in my opinion) have made it through quality control. The boost midsole was a huge selling point, it's the first time it's been silver and one of the few times it has been coloured. On both of my shoes, the boost is damaged. It's cosmetic and doesn't really impact performance, but at £140 and an adidas product, I'm really disappointed. It looks as though the shoes have been worn before being shipped. The heel area is creased and there are holes present throughout the shoes. I feel as if the quality of boost has gone downhill as of late. I own 4 pairs of NMDs and 2 other pairs of Ultra Boosts. The shoes purchased prior to December 2016 had no issues at all and were perfect. But the shoes purchased from mid December onwards have been really sub par. This is the 3rd pair of boost shoes I've bought within that time frame that have had issues with quality control on the boost sole. 

I don't know if it's just my luck or what, but its really quite upsetting. I'm passionate about sneakers and love what adidas have been doing lately but this issue needs to be resolved. If you can get a pair without any issues, then I'd go for them. But I'm not sure if I'll be buying anymore for awhile.","Great shoe design, poor quality",BEY09

3,12/02/2017,I have worn Supernovas for 3-4 years. Previous versions have fit very well. This latest model did not fit as well as the previous models. The heel cup is more shallow and they are tighter across the ball of the foot. I will stay with adidas but will look for a different model that fits better.,Not as good as previous model,BEY10
5,12/02/2017,There wasn't a need to break them in. Once on they cushion joints and give an extra hop in step.,Put them on and it felt like walking on air.,BEY10

4,10/22/2017,"Compared to the Adidas Supernova Glide 8 these STs are not the same, the quality of the Supernova Glide 8 is far superior.

I do short runs (a mile or so) and play volleyball in them, as well as just general playing around, chasing the kids about.  They work great for everything.  They were slightly too snug/narrow at first, but with a little use are about perfect.",Great quality all-around shoe,BEY10

3,09/27/2017,"I bought these because I thought they would be a cheaper alternative to the Ultraboost ST. They just don’t compare. The heel is too shallow and you have to lock them down. Even then, they just don’t mold to my foot like adidas usually do. 

They aren’t bad shoes if they suit you, but they are not in the same class as the ultraboost ST. Spend the extra, especially since the adidas website gives you 15% off.",Shallow heel,BEY10
2,09/24/2017,"Weird heel design. Too short, too wide at heel. My foot slipped out.",,BEY10
5,09/10/2017,I ordered these because I always wear Adidas because of quality comfort and fit. I was not disappointed once again. I was able to start walking and jogging right away. No break in period necessary,Excellent like I expected,BEY10

4,07/20/2017,"For those used to running in Adidas Supernova Sequence stability shoes, the ST offers greater absorption of impact and much better cushioning with the use of the Boost technology.

The toe box feels slightly wider but the internally the shoe is a more comfortable fit as a whole compared with previous Supernova Sequence.

A slightly lighter shoe and sleek design with the boost technology is a great step in the right direction for Adidas and the stability line. 

I did buy the black colour online and would say these actually appear more on the dark grey side than the black it shows on the website.",Surpasses the old Supernova Sequence Stability shoe,BEY10

5,07/07/2017,"Great shoe, nice and light and you can feel the spring when running.",Glad I purchased it,BEY10
3,07/05/2017,"Found that the product ran a little wider / larger than supernova sequence 9s I owned.

Slight issue with the design around the ankle - feels a bit lacking in support compared to other adidas trainers (i.e. sequence boosts and boost STs) which led to slight slippage around ankle area over longer runs. Overall, very comfortable for walking around and gym use but have not my preferred choice for running outdoors over any 10km+ distance.","Comfortable, good looking trainer but not recommended for longer distances",BEY10

5,11/21/2017,AMAZINGLY LIGHT WITHOUT COMPROMISING STABILITY AND CUSHION!,2ND PAIR DIFFERENT COLOR,BEY99
2,11/18/2017,"I started running on a pair of tempo 8 (v1 green) and I loved literally everything about them (about 600 miles at this point). This new version went on sale and I jumped on it, to extreme disappointment. Out of the box the laces come going out to in, unlike literally every other shoe requiring you to take them out and re-lace them. The tongue is no longer gusseted, therefor slides and bunches. The quality feels HEAVILY reduced, feeling cheap on your foot. The toe box is much smaller, they reduced the stable frame from under the ball of your foot to just under your toes and replaced it with a energized stability boost, which I feel like once broken in won't give nearly as much pronation support as the stable frame. To try and compensate the pushing forward of the stable frame they tried to compensate by adding more torsional control on the inner heel alike the supernova, but it just makes the shoes ridiculously rigid out of the box. I'm disappointed because the tempo 8's are the most comfortable feeling shoes to run in both long and short distances, and this seems like a serious step down :/",Not the same,BEY99
5,11/18/2017,"Great quality, boost cushioning is awesome. Higly recommended.",,BEY99
4,11/18/2017,"I've had at least 3 tempos before (the 5 and two pairs of the 6), all of which were before the Boost technology. I still love the shoe, but the sizing is so frustrating - I was 9.5 in the other pairs, but the sizing for this model seems to have changed. It's silly that there is so little consistency. BUT, if you can get the size right I'm confident this would be an even better shoe than its predecessors. ""Light makes fast"" as the insoles used to say. I use mine for pretty much all running, not just threshold/tempo runs. If you're not too heavy (I'm 10 stone 2 pounds) and need no or only mild stability features, why wouldn't you?",light makes fast,BEY99

5,11/09/2017,perfect step between the supernova and boston/adios.,,BEY99
5,11/09/2017,This shoe is perfect for someone who needs a little bit of stability but not a huge amount. I used to wear Supernova's and Adios' but they had no stability features and so I needed to move to more supportive shoes. The Tempo's still feel light enough to race in but sturdy enough to get you through a marathon.,"Great shoe for speed, track and medium distance running",BEY99

5,10/27/2017,Super comfortable for the longer runs yet fast enough for speed work-outs. Great to train in these and race in the Adios.,Best training shoe ever,BEY99
3,10/18/2017,"I liked them but the process to get them was kind of hard cause the size I always wear with the previous adidas shoes I bought (I love adidas stuff) was 9 1/2 and this ones were too tight so I returned them and bought a half size bigger, and it results also this ones feel tight and also I can see my finger through the shoe, I am going to keep them and see how they work in a 10 km run.",Cool but too small compred to my terrex shoes,BEY99

2,09/29/2017,Quality wise no issues but colour was not as expected,The colour looks pinkish in reality so had to return. It doesn't looo like red as shown in pictures.,BEY99
4,09/27/2017,"These are just a little bit shorter than Adizero Adios 2 (the old non-Boost ones). I've always used the same size for Adidas but I think I need to go 1/2 size up with all the current Adizero models.

These have the same issue as I had with Supernova: The midfoot part is way too narrow. (I have regular width forefoot.) The high edge of the midsole hits my arch. I think at least the Supernova line has gone narrower from midfoot after Glide 7...

I returned these. However, the shoes appeared to be very good so if your midfoot is narrow these can work for you. The heel is almost completely neutral. The front has the most of the stability features. The cushioning felt excellent: not too soft but not hard at all, just right.",Great but way too narrow midfoot,BEY99
5,09/02/2017,"If you like the Adios Adizero 3 and looking for something similar with more support, these shoes are for you. Just like the Adios, they will take time to stretch and get comfortable. Put in at least 20 miles before judging these shoes. They offer support without the annoying heel slippage that comes with the big bulky stability shoes.",Perfect balance between light and stability,BEY99
3,08/29/2017,"These are great shoes in terms of quality &looks. However, slightly narrow on the toes and it seems the left and right fit not exactly the same. 
Still I like wearing them.","Great shoes, slightly in the narrow side",BEY99

shoe fits pretty well and is recommended for frequent runners with distance below 20km",great runners shoe,BEY99
5,08/06/2017,The shoe fits very nicely on the feet and wraps around so smooth and light..perfect for tempo runs,Wonderful fitting shoe!,BEY99
4,07/23/2017,"It's a great shoe for fast paced dailey training. I kept the same size as my other adidas shoes. The fit of this shoe is different from the other shoes. It has a snug forefoot, but not uncomfortable. It has also a pointy toe-box. Which means that the Tempo 9 has an overall snug fit including a relatively shallow toe-box.  A faster shoe is tighter like a race-shoe. As for the fit, the Tempo 9 has a bit of a racing shoe. For me, no problem.  However, people with a wider forefoot should keep this in mind and better choose a size larger. The Tempo 9 has a firm ride. Soft the shoe may not be, but responsive it certainly is. The Tempo 9 is a lightweight and supportive trainer. The tempo 9 is a neutral runningshoe. But I have a slight overpronation. However, the shoe supports sufficient and has no problems in this area. The upper is airy en there's enough ventilation. I can't say much about the durability of the shoe. But my experience with my other adidas says this is good. The Continental outsoles are very durable. So I'm verry happy with these shoes.",Good shoe for fast paced daily training,BEY99
5,07/20/2017,This is my third comment on these shoes. They are absolutely wonderful. I am going to order another pair.,Wondedrful.,BEY99
5,07/17/2017,"I've been wearing the previous version of the Tempo, the Tempo 8, as my daily trainer for everything from steady long runs to fast interval sessions. The Tempo 8 were very good shoes, but the Tempo 9 are better. I race in the Adios 3, and the Tempo 9 are a beefed up version of the Adios 3 in many respects. The upper of the Tempo 9 is the biggest improvement over the Tempo 8. Gone is the sleeve, in favour of a more traditional tongue with a lace loop. The tongue is more comfortable than the previous versions sleeve. I always found the sleeve a slight bit too short on the Tempo 8, but the tongue on the Tempo 9 solves that. The sole unit is changed, and now uses dual density Boost in the midfoot on the inside. In reality this feels quite similar to the previous version, offering just a touch of stability. The torsion system in the new version is very similar to the Adios 3, and extends to the inner heel, which it didn't do on the Tempo 8. If anything this makes the Tempo 9 feel more responsive, but not noticeably more so than the 8. The Continental rubber outsole, a brilliant compound offering great grip on tar, grass or even compact trail, has been beefed up a little and should last longer. If you liked the Tempo 8, you'll get on great with the Tempo 9. If you race in the Adios 3, you could easily use the Tempo 9 as your daily trainer. The fit of the upper feels a little more ""racing flat"" than the Tempo 8. Fits my foot perfectly, but those with wider feet will need to try them on before buying. Overall the build quality is a step up on the newer version, but the feel is very similar to the 8 if a little snappier. Drop remains at 10mm so nothing to worry about there.",A great companion to the Adios 3,BEY99
3,07/16/2017,"My first disappointing sneakers from Adidas. First of all, these shoes are much more green in person than the pictures show. So if you were hoping for a turquoise blue, like in the pics, you will not be getting those. There were also several QC issues. Loose stitching in a couple spots. Large chunks of what appeared to be excess thread stuck between seams, affecting the aesthetic. As for the Boost soles, they do appear substantial, but while moderately comfortable to walk in, the cushioning was nowhere near my Iniki Runners. I was pleasantly surprised by how breathable the shoes were. Very airy. But misleading color, QC issues, and insufficient Boost, make this an average shoe at best. Glad I didn't pay full price!",,BEY99

My only complaint is that the white midsole gets dirty and scuffed quite easily. So far it cleans up decently, but I can tell the bright white is not going to last. If you wear these sparingly and not on outdoor trails (dirt, gravel, etc.) it should be fine, but it will inevitably become scuffed.

4,06/05/2017,"Some things you may want to know about me before you read this. I have worn Ultraboosts (caged/uncaged), PK NMDs and Pureboosts before. While I have had several opportunities to cop, but I always cheaped out or returned them because I couldn't justify spending 150+ on shoes I intend to wear. That being said, in December I finally pulled the trigger on these shoes, and I was  pleasantly surprised yet slightly disappointed.

First, the positives. The upper is super breathable with a pretty cool pattern. I have wide feet (to the point where classic stan smiths are uncomfortable to wear) and these are perfect. I took these with me to NYC and they held up great. The breathable upper kept my feet cool in the humid weather, and the boost held up well under my 185 lbs of raw fat. And despite not being Continental, the sole is still holding up on my pair.

Here are the negatives. I feel that for the quality of the upper we should be charged a price closer to 120USD. The weave is tough, but doesn't feel/look the best (in my opinion). Also, I purchased the Core Black, Core Black, Running White version. I personally like the pattern, but I had to get used to people mistaking them for Feezys. The boost is also more stiff than the Ultraboost's which I've found to still be very comfortable (just not as comfortable). The tongue can also be off putting to people. I personally don't mind the burrito style but many people I have spoken to have been turned off by them. And lastly, the adidas website pictures fail to present how pronounced the three stripes are on the shoe. The three stripes look like a subtle grey in the website photo, but it is a very pronounced black in the final product. Some people may like that about the shoe, but I personally hoped for a more subtle look.

Where does this shoe sits in the current market? Besides knit NMDs, it's hard to find a pair of streetwear shoes with boost for this cheap. The uppers of both the Ultraboosts (caged/uncaged) and PK NMDs are far superior in softness/stretch, but not breathability. Despite this, I would still rank them in the following order of comfort.

1. Ultraboost (caged)
2. Pureboost
3. Ultraboost (uncaged)
4. PK NMD

The reason why Pureboosts beat out uncaged Ultraboosts and PK NMDs are the following. I have found that the collars of both Ultraboost (uncaged) and NMD to be very constricting around my ankle (I would say I have regular sized ankles). I also preferred the slightly wider cushion of boost. While the Ultraboost (uncaged) had a superior sole/midsole, I could not get over the ankle collar's vice-like grip. Maybe it's something you need to stretch out with time? I'm not sure.

While there are several negatives to the Pureboosts, the shoe is still great, and the current best gateway to comfortable boost. If you're on a limited budget and don't care what others think I couldn't recommend them more. But if you're looking for the best in comfort and style, save your money for a pair of Ultraboosts (caged). That's what I plan to be my next cop.",2nd Place Ain't So Bad,IJD73

5,05/25/2017,"These are a great alternative to the Ultraboost if you could not get the UB in your fav colorway or if you just wanna save that much extra cash. In my opinion, these are not that much behind the UB in terms of comfort. You definitely feel that the Boost is thinner than the UB under your feet, but this also allows for better ground feel if you plan to run with these. The circle knit upper is very comfy too. It's not stretchy, so it provides more support and security. Heel lockdown is way better than the UB 3.0 (you're out of luck if you wanna wear these as slip-ons). Style-wise, man, these are dope. The silhouette is not as classic as the UB, but these may even look ever so slightly cleaner that UBs.

These have held the title for the most comfortable pair of shoes I own for quite some time before I got my UBs. Take my word for it: throw a pair of Ortholite insoles in these, and you get about three quarters of the comfort level of UBs. No joke. These are a great deal.","Very comfy, great alternative to the Ultraboost",IJD73
4,05/19/2017,"The shoe is beautiful. However, the product team seems to have missed some very obvious and glaring issues. #1) What is up with the tongue? There is no reason it needed to be designed like that. As John Oliver would say... ""...cool."" It occasionally clumps strangely leading to blisters on the top of my foot. #2) The material around the ankle chafes me severely on every run. Friend has same shoes, same issue. I don't want to have to wear thick shin high wool ankle shoes to go for a run. #3) The sole is incredibly hard near the tip of the shoe. This makes running on toes painful. 

The shoe is beautiful though. So I'll give it that.","Beautiful, but really bad pitfalls.",IJD73

1,03/13/2017,I don't know if it's just me or what but that bump in arch was rock hard. The softness of the rest of the shoe only seemed to highlight the hardness of the arch support.

5,03/05/2017,Got the new pure boost in store because everything was sold out online. Chanced upon new released colors and after fitting I knew that I'm going to buy it or my size will be gone. The sizing is true to my size.,Very light very fit very soft very comfortable,IJD73
3,03/04/2017,These don't compare at all to the ultra boosts. Spend the $40 more dollars for those. They are also extremely wide so the loose lace look is hard to achieve.,If only style = comfort,IJD73
5,03/04/2017,Best shoe! I went a half size up and it still fits me very well!,Amazing.,IJD73
5,02/27/2017,These have got to be the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. One warning however - get good at cleaning shoes because the bright white picks up everything!,Would buy boost again,IJD73

5,02/24/2017,"Wide forefoot equals better stability. TAKE OUT SOME INSOLES FROM ULTRABOOST , then you have ULTRA pureboosts!!! the only thing they need is an insole and then they are softer, BETTER BALANCED and are cheaper than the hyped ultraboosts. The shoes look firee in hand, if only ultraboosts made the forefoot the same as in these pureboost. THAT would be dope and i would buy  them!!

4,02/16/2017,Extremely comfortable and responsive shoe. The next best thing to the ultra boost.,The only thing holding this shoe back is the lack of torsion bar and continental rubber,IJD73
5,02/16/2017,PureBoost shoes are what I use for running for long periods of time and they are comfortable to the feet and had no problems with plantar pronation . Also I use them for periodic non-workout use and have no problems with them. Note if you are for example a 9 get a 8.5 for a snug fit because the width is bigger in this type of shoe.,"Very comfortable, good for running!",IJD73

2,02/13/2017,"I love the looks and fit but the insole is very uncomfortable.  Rather than a solid foam insole, this shoe has an insole with round holes that seem to match the soles of the shoes.  I could feel them when I walked in the shoe and feel it would be very uncomfortable while running.  I returned them and will go back to the ultra boost which are my favorite shoe.",With a little work could be a great shoe.,IJD73

5,02/10/2017,The level of comfort would place this shoe between ultra boosts and NMDs,Great gift from my gf. Now I don't have to buy them.,IJD73
5,02/09/2017,"It is a very nice shoe for the price. I love the boost technology in the shoe. They are a very good running shoe but, it can also be used for a casual ware shoe. The only problem that I am having a problem with is that on the inside of the shoe they made they out-sole move up the side of the arch. I see what they were trying to do, but to be honest with you it sort of hurts after a while. The material is a circle knit it is not as comfortable as prime knit but still breathable and comfortable. All in all I would recommend these shoes to any one.",My best shoe in the collection.,IJD73
5,02/08/2017,"Since people undoubtedly want to know the differences between this Pure Boost and the Ultra Boost (3.0), here they are:

General comparison:
- The boost is the same material, and the compression rate is very similar
- The Pure Boost has no insole and feels the same as an NMD when I'm walking around; if I pull out the insole of the Ultra Boost and walk around, they're similar to these.
- The Pure Boost is much more laterally-stable than the Ultra Boost (I'm a neutral runner)
- I experience zero heel slip in the Pure Boost; however, I do experience a small amount of heel slip in the Ultra Boost
- The knit of the Pure Boost is soft and does stretch but not as much as my Ultra Boost
- The weird tongue of the Pure Boost is actually pretty good - when I'm wearing this sneaker, it feels like an NMD, but is easier to slip on
- I never untie my Ultra Boosts / NMDs (there's no point); you will need to tie/untie the Pure Boosts (btw the lace guides on the Pure Boosts bind a little bit, just like the NMDs)
- Traction is the same as the Ultra Boost. Different rubber most likely but any differences are undetectable

Sizing (I am a size 9.5 US on the silver foot-measuring tools found in shoe stores):
- These match the measuring-tool. I ordered a 9.5, and they are spot on. I could easily go to a 10, if I wanted more toe space and I anticipate no issues, since a 10 would be only about 3/16in longer
- Same length as my size 9.5 Ultra Boosts
- Footbed width is the same as the Ultra Boosts (outsole is much wider than the UB outsole)

Conclusions:
- I love these as a casual and/or trainer 
- These are close to NMDs in general comfort/feel
- Lockdown is superior to the Ultra Boosts
- I'd run in these before I'd run in the Ultra Boosts
- If anyone reading this is looking for a purpose-built running shoe, ditch these and pick up the adidas Supernovas. Those are true running shoes.",Solid training shoe so far...,IJD73
3,02/07/2017,"Boost sole was hard , not as squishy as the nmd at all. And dont even try to compare it to Ultra Boost, theres no comparison, you better off paying $40 more for Ultra Boost instead.",,IJD73
5,02/06/2017,Go a half size down. Very high quality and very comfortable.,Best purchase ever,IJD73
5,02/05/2017,"my new beaters! lots of people are sleeping on these but at least one pair should be in your rotation. the length is TTS and the width is actually pretty wide... you won't get that snug fit like an UB... so for those with wide feet, these are your sneakers! if you want extra comfort, get half size up and put in a thin insole (no insole like the NMD).. that'll put it very close on par with a UB cushion.. makes a big difference. That burrito tongue ... doesn't get in the way, you won't even notice it. and if you can, lace swap with black 3Ms!! totally recommend this shoe!",these should be in your rotation!,IJD73
5,02/05/2017,"Got both Burgundy and Black one, they are super comfy. I went TTS, but i think down 1/2 a size would fit better.

5,01/25/2017,"Really enjoy these shoes, very comfortable and super stylish. I have the black/ white ones and they are the best colorway to me.

5,01/22/2017,Very comfortable and god for running. Overall very good shoe,Best purchase ever,IJD73
5,01/22/2017,Was finally able to purchase a newly released boost shoe! The first colorway released and sold out quick online. I found mine surprisingly at my local mall. I have been trying to cop a pair of ultra boost for long time but not knowing how it fits makes it hard to order correct size even if I had a chance. These new pure boost fit true to size some may prefer a half size down for a more snug fit. I went TTS because I didn't like the added pressure on my big toe. And I figured my feet would like the extra room during a long work day. I purchased a size 12 but 11.5 fit as well though more snug. It was nice to go into a local store and actually be able to try on multiple sizes and make a purchase. Hopefully more adidas boost shoes (hint hint even more expensive ultra boost) will atleast have basic non limited colorways available at more brick and mortar stores. This would allow a customers like me to see the shoes in person and get a feel for the fit. Then we would know what size to order when the limited colorways arrive! Boost feels amazing and this new pure boost style is dope!,Great looking and very comfortable shoe.,IJD73

I am a standard size 7.5, and I could've honestly used either the 7, or maybe even the 6.5 with how large this shoe runs. I bought this shoe with the intention of running - and with purpose of going to the gym and walking around / running errands. Would have loved to use it, as it is SUPER comfy - but I'm not sure it's worth the purchase price (plus, it's a little heavy for a running shoe)... so I sadly did not exchange for correct size. Cannot comment on durability or longevity of this product, as I have not ran in them. The concept seems cool, but the price tag is not (especially since the sizing is so far off).",Neat idea. Poor sizing. Comfortable Fit. Heavy for running.,BEY13
4,05/02/2017,"Usually wear between a size 6 but knew these would run a bit narrow so I went ahead and order a size 6.5 fits pretty good length wise and snug on the sides, I would recommend if you have a wide foot to order a half size but.

3,03/11/2017,It definitely needs getting used to the first couple of times. A bit too tight and narrow for my own liking and you'll either have to go barefoot or wear thin socks. I suppose it's because I'm used to my other pair of incredibly comfortable Ultraboosts.,Buy a 1/2 size up,BEY13

2,08/15/2017,"I liked the boost material on bottom. Having foam instead of all boost actually gave a more firm feeling (which I kinda liked).

5,11/20/2017,"I have been running in Supernovas for over 6 years now - long before BOOST was a thing.

This newest model is an extremely high performance shoe which is highly stable, fits like a glove, feels extremely comfortable and is FAST! Ever since BOOST came around, I haven't had any stress fractures training for Ironman races, and this shoe is no different (I have ~200km banked in this current model and they feel great.)

3,09/16/2017,"I bought 2 pair of these shoes at the outlet mall in Allen, TX. I've been looking for a replacement running shoe for one named after a mythological winged horse. This shoe is definitely in the same class and category. Initially I was very pleased with the comfort and softness of the shoe and the Boost foam. The shoe felt a little heavy and clunky compared to what I was used to running in, but then again, I'm on a shoe hunt. It's now 7.5 months later and each shoe has about 160 miles on them. The uppers still look great and no separation of materials. But the tread material on the outsoles is thinning badly. I'm a bit of a heel striker, and the soles have worn down to nothing on the outer edges and ready to start wearing into the white Boost foam midsole. I don't know if I'll even get 200 miles out of these. 160 miles seems a bit low to expect to get out of a pair of running shoes.

5,07/24/2017,"So, I have flat feet and these shoes are the perfect match for my needs. When I run the outside of my foot lands first, and this leads to getting really fast shin splints for me. I did some research and I concluded that these were prob the best shoes out there for my kind of foot. I'm not the type to write reviews, but man not even a week in and my shin splints are already to a minimum. There's only one downside about the shoe, but I believe that it's outweighed by all the pros: breaking in the shoes was the worst on my shins I could barely walk after the first time I ran in them. But if you need a shoe that helps with supination then I believe that's a small obstacle that's easily overcome within a week. Also, I know that you should always buy bigger running shoes than normal shoes, but in my experience these adidas shoes scale a bit bigger than normal running shoes. I got the 10.5 even though my normal shoe size is 10, but they were a perfect fit",Best running shoes for supination,CEN74
3,07/23/2017,These shoes run small. I ordered an 11 which is the same size as the ultra boost I ordered previously.

1,07/14/2017,"Complete overhaul on the 8s and not in a good way. These are now best suited as walking shoes, too soft and unstable for the long haul running that the previous generations were VERY good at. The imbalance is largely due to too much boost, a new cage/heel cup and a change to the continental rubber which seems less durable. If you can find previous models in your size, I'd recommend those instead. Real shame.",Taken a step back,CEN74

1,06/27/2017,"I have the previous version (Supernova Glide 8) of this shoe so I had high expectations for this newer version. I was excited to get these in the mail however once I put them on, I was extremely disappointed. The midsection of this shoe is extremely constricting. The stitching connecting the tongue to the upper in the inside of the shoe is too thick and puts a lot of pressure on top of my foot. This makes it feel like an object is stuck between my sock and the shoe. I have readjusted the laces but it is still uncomfortable.

I will be returning these shoes ASAP.",Disappointing,CEN74

1,06/15/2017,"adidas has been churning out a series of bulky, extremely heavy running shoes lately. Also, I notices adidas has been focusing on style (looks) rather than functionality. At any rate, these shoes are well designed. They're pretty. But when you wear them you feel like you're wearing lead boots. This is a shoe that comes at 10 oz for size 9. That's heavy! I wear size 11.5, so you do the math. There are other options on the market of shoes that are much lighter and are also durable.

4,04/28/2017,These sneakers fit great and are super comfortable just what I would expect from a supernova glide.

5,04/14/2017,"I haven't had a chance to run in these shoes yet, but from experience with Boost shoes they will be comfortable from the first KM all the way through many many hundreds of KMs. When I first put the shoe on, and wore it around walking for a bit, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the material on the inside of the shoe. The shoe really hugs around your heel and achilles tendon very nicely. The upper material is very soft and stretchy further increasing comfort without sacrificing stability. There is more of a Boost midsole compared to previous models of this shoe and you can feel right away the added ""cloudy"" feeling within every step.

4,03/19/2017,The Glide 9 appears to be a complete sole re-design from the SuperNova Glide 8.  You should consider the Glide 8 to be the last of its line and the 9 to be a completely different model.  I have trained for and ran 6 marathons in the SuperNova Glide 2 through 7.  After only a couple of winter runs it is too early to tell how this shoe will compare.,A good marathon training shoe.,CEN74

This new version feels too heavy and lost the responsiveness I loved. Will be returning these shoes and sadly need to look for another shoe. Frustrating when shoe companies change an already very good shoe to something completely different.,Really miss previous versions,CEN74
5,02/22/2017,"Not my most expensive shoe purchase ever, but it is my best purchase ever. No other shoes compares when it comes to comfort. Boost + Torsion + Continental rubber you can't go wrong.

5,02/18/2017,Good running shoe good spring in the sole for calf protection not quite a marathon trainer but good style and all round run performance,Very good running trainer,CEN74
2,02/18/2017,"I have to agree with the other reviewers which have pointed out how the Glide 8 was so much better. This has nothing of the responsiveness of the previous model, it's just too mushy and soft, and the tongue is too long and won't stay in place.

Why change what was pretty much a perfect shoe for the worse?",Disappointing successor to the Glide 8,CEN74
4,02/18/2017,"quit making shoes so narrow! the sole is wider than my other adidas running shoes but ends there. tongue doesn't stay in place. I love adidas shoes but  they won't address people with wide feet. I'm 5'10"" and 195lbs.",narrow!,CEN74
3,02/16/2017,"The end of an era. Adidas finally changed this shoe...a lot. And in this case it's not an improvement. There's nothing inherently wrong with the new Supernova, but it holds almost nothing in common with the previous versions. The Glide Boost has been my favorite distance running shoe since it was introduced a few years back. The previous versions 2013-2016 were the absolute perfect blend of well cushioned trainer and excellent feel. This current version of the Supernova has lost all of snapiness. What's left feels like a maximal plush ride for moderate to slow pace. The sizing is also strange. I feel like the shoe has gotten shorter and more narrow than the previous versions. I had to go up half a size which only added to the already bulky feel. The bottom line is that the Supernova might be a solid shoe for someone with no history with this model, but in my opinion it is inferior in all the ways that matter to the previous versions. I suppose I better start stocking up on old inventory. I can't stress how disappointing it is to lose the niche this model filled.",Decent shoe. This is not the Glide Boost I know.,CEN74
3,02/14/2017,"These are a step back from the Glide 7 & 8. The upper is more constrictive with more pressure points, and the cushioning is now too soft and nowhere near as responsive as the last models. Overall a decent shoe, but I wish Adidas would have left a good thing alone.","Good shoe, but step back from the Glide 8",CEN74
4,02/14/2017,"The product is quite simply one of the best boost based products out there. From previously using the cushioned response 22 shoe, this is probably the next best thing. However, there is the need to order a half a shoe size up as the Adidas fit is smaller than most other manufactures out there.",Well cushioned and extremely comfortable ride.,CEN74
2,02/12/2017,"If you are buying this due to how good the Glide 8 was, I'd go elsewhere. There are a number of changes over the Glide 8, the tongue and sole are quite different and sadly not in a good way. 

The new eyelet design results in either a failure to be able to get it comfortably tied or a tongue that will slip during running. 

The sole is now so soft it feels as if it has lost the responsiveness of the previous version. It is ok for a lazy Sunday run, but at pace it feels like a drag that adds to the work. This softness will also increase calf strain, which may lead to calf pain. 

On the plus side the new sole is very grippy and durable. 

At this stage this shoe is being retired to my lazy short runs and I'm picking another shoe for those beyond 5km or those where I want a faster pace.",100km down and time for a replacement,CEN74
5,02/10/2017,"I tend to have wide feet, but these shoes fit perfect. Even though they're a neutral shoe it is very stable and the cushioning is awesome.

1,02/07/2017,"I don't the material used in the toe box. This started with the glide 8 and now the glide 9. It's a real step backward from the glide 7. My foot just does not feel locked in while wearing this new design. It seems to slide around like it needs more support. I have to over tighten the laces to make up for that, which makes the shoe less comfortable. That's a real bummer because I absolutely loved the glide 7.",I wonder if in need to try something else.,CEN74
5,02/05/2017,actually I bought it just today and I found out that this shoe is the best show I've ever had I recommend it to everybody because it's just great comfortable and just the best shoe ever,The best shoe a person can get,CEN74
5,02/02/2017,"I have worn Adidas shoes for many years now, I have to keep reasonably fit by walking about 6 to 8 Kms about 4 to 5 times a week mostly up hills, I cant run due to a problem in my lower back which I injured when I was working and when I retired I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, thats why I have to keep reasonably fit.

4,01/18/2017,"I haven't got on board with these quite as much as I did with the Glide 7 and 8. They seem a little tighter around the middle and top of the shoe, and the ride is a little more clumpy. 200 miles in and I've have worn them in somewhat now so they don't feel as constricting, and they're still a good reliable shoe for putting in lots of mileage during training. But maybe be aware of the fit if you haven't got the narrowest feet.",Not quite the Glide 8 but still good for putting in the miles,CEN74
1,01/11/2017,"I finally worn out my second pair of supernova 7's and fancied an upgrade to the new supernova 9. Felt fine when I tried them on, but after a few miles running in them, I was feeling a discomfort under both my feet arches. Whilst there is huge amounts of cushioning, this was far too soft and resulted in my foot hitting the harder mid cushioning layer. felt like stepping on a stone every time I ran. I cannot run in these shoes, they are too painful. the old supernovas were great - i would recommend them to any neutral runner. the newest design is oh so terrible. £100 wasted.",unbearable,CEN74
1,01/06/2017,"This is a terrible update of my favorite trainer. It is basically a completely different shoe from the Glide 8. The new version feels clunky. They added about a half inch of stack height to the shoe for some reason. The tongue is ridiculously long and does not stay in place. It slides way over to the inside of the shoe. I went through 9 pairs of the Glide over the past three years and loved them. Now Adidas doesn't have a normal daily trainer in their lineup, so unfortunately I will have to look at other brands.","Terrible update, nothing like previous version.",CEN74

1,12/10/2016,"Wow I really did not like this shoe. Going back a shoe generation, the Supernova Glide 8 is my all-time favorite running shoe. In my opinion, it has an ideal balance of cushion and weight and makes running an absolute pleasure over almost any surface. That’s why I was so excited to try these new shoes, the Adidas Supernova (ordered directly from Adidas). The promise of 20% more cushion with only a .1 ounce weight gain coupled with slightly better heel lockdown was extremely intriguing and I couldn’t wait to try them out. Unfortunately, instead of having an even better experience than the one I had with the Glide 8, I had the WORST experience I’ve ever had with running shoes, and I’ve worn quite a few! First, the mid-section of the shoe is so tight that I felt like the blood flow had cut off in my feet. Let me just say, I’m 5’8, weigh 150, and I most certainly do NOT have wide feet. If anything, they’re on the narrow side. As a size 11, the length of the shoe was fine, but the mid-section was absolutely constricting. Second, on the left shoe, the top left Adidas stripe on the shoe was connected to a border material that was literally pushing into my foot when I ran. It felt like someone was jamming their finger into my foot. My immediate reaction was to redo/loosen the laces on the shoe and to adjust the shoe generally, but to no avail. It was such an unpleasant experience that I had to stop a half mile into my run because the shoes were hurting my feet so much. Even more than I am disappointed, I’m baffled that a shoe company like Adidas could create something so great with the Glide 8 and could turn around and design something as poor as this. Adidas, did you not test these extensively before release? Could this be a quality/control issue in manufacturing? Suffice it to say I will be sending these back. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that I did not toss my Supernova Glide 8’s (phew!) and will be very happily returning to them tomorrow morning.",Huge Step Down from the Supernova Glide 8,CEN74

With no flex in my right big toe, I overpronate wildly; this shoe gives me a bit of stability without forcing me into an unnatural gate. I've had no foot or ankle issues since I started wearing them in May, and I'm retiring them for a new pair after a November marathon. One caution: these run BIG.

I was a long-time committed Adidas wearer when I decided to switch things up...New Balance, Brooks, etc. Those were great shoes and hit all the right notes...but none could match the support & structured fit of an Adidas. So, since these were on sale, I decided to give them a try. If you like a firm, stiff shoe with lots of support, this is for you! Good , not great, cushioning...four out of five, maybe. The downside to all that structural support is weight...may be my imagination but these feel heavy, or heavier than I’d grown used to. My other quibble is the fit at the top, front part of the ankle...at the laces. There’s a really stiff bit of material on either side of the last lace hole. At first it went unnoticed...Once home, I re-laced & omitted the final 2 (?) holes. So far, so good...no blisters, hot spots or irritations. I’m happy with these...for now, I’m alternating between the Adidas and another brand.

Not a big deal, but I wish the size chart had an in/cm comparison so I could've been sure of which size to get. The reason I'm not just exchanging for a half size smaller is because they are not black (with purple/coral) like I thought, but a deep dusty blue.

2,08/27/2017,"Second pair of defective boosts I get from Adidas. And they have this odd ""no exchange policy"" that makes absolutely no sense. Their sizing is completely inconsistent between every single style, which makes it even more difficult to shop online. Also, it's very difficult for them to honor a previous discount for a pair you previously ordered, But because of inconsistencies in sizing and defective shoes, you have to return, wait for a refund, re-order and actually pay more for the new pair. They won't do much to help. Not happy with adidas online. At all. 

My second pair on the part where the laces go, it would not sit flush to the shoe, it would stick out, a lot. Didn't matter how tight I'd tie it, it would still stick out. Both shoes. One in both sides (as pictured) and the other on one, also about 1/2 size smaller than the first pair.

4,10/23/2017,"I really like the Ultraboost laceless. It's a stylish and futuristic looking addition to the Ultraboost family. The black has a clean look because of its single color. I've noticed that others have found the ribbed part of the Primeknit controversial. Some love it or hate it. I found it interesting texturally and visually, but it offers no structural support to your foot like the cage. I don't have to go into the comfort of the Ultraboost itself-it's why this line of shoes is so popular. I think every Adidas shoe should incorporate Ultraboost in some way. So why isn't this review five stars? The Primeknit upper is a different weave compared to the Ultraboost caged and uncaged. Consequently, the shoe feels tighter and less comfortable compared to the caged and uncaged. There is less give and stretch in the toe box. It feels like the Ultraboost laceless runs a half size smaller than marked. You may want to order both your normal size and a half size larger to try.",Stylist and Futuristic,DWG26

4,09/24/2017,"These shoes have quickly become the most stylish and comfortable pair of shoes I own. The Adidas Primeknit upper is amazingly well crafted and really does wrap around your foot like a sock. The cushioning on the bottom is equally impressive as well as sturdy and comfortable. I was initially afraid that the laceless design would result in a looser grip on the foot, but not the case. I have had no issues with these shoes slipping off and wear them almost everyday. This is also my first UltraBOOST purchase and I will definitely be buying more in the future.

Update: Still love the shoes, but I have to dock a star. They tend to cause my feet a great deal of discomfort when I wear them for extended periods of time so not ideal for long shifts or all day use.",New Favorite Shoes,DWG26
4,09/17/2017,"I've always thought laces were such an old-fashioned technology so when I heard these were releasing, I knew I had to get a pair, and bought them soon as they were available. 

I'm on my feet all day at work, so I just love Boost. I'm a big fan of the uncaged Ultra Boost and NMD City Socks, and though the former has laces, I felt they were ornamental. This new laceless version of Ultra Boost fits differently than the two previously mentioned shoes, in that the extra banding of elastic accurately replaces the feeling of tighter laces, where the CS feels looser, at least to my foot and in the same size (US13). The uncaged UB were snug when I first got them but never as much in the lace area, and I'm not certain I prefer this new fit, though I'm sure it's better for my foot than the way I wear my UB's (loose-laced). 

I did take off a star from the overall rating mostly because of the cuff on them. It's a different cuff than that of the Ultra Boost cuff that I absolutely love. This feels less like clothing and more like a strap or a tight waistband and there's stitching on the back that rubbed the back of my ankle like crazy and I had to put a band-aid on to make it through the rest of my day at work. That might be just my pair, as I noticed it more on one ankle than the other. 

If these had the sock-like uncaged cuff, these would be my perfect pair of sneakers. I'm hoping if I wear them more they'll loosen up in the right places and fit closer to the uncaged pair I was wearing regularly before I got these.

Overall, they're a great sneaker, just hope next time they feature the softer sock-like cuffs that I love.",Laces are not necessary.,DWG26

5,09/14/2017,"Most perfect and comfortable shoes....EVER. The primeknit is light yet extraordinarily sturdy, and literally hugs my feet snuggly with ultimate support.

Seriously.",O....M...G....!!!!,DWG26
5,09/11/2017,"For those who are wondering how the fit it is, they feel like the conventional Ultra Boost 3.0 with the laces tied more on the tight side. More stability due to the fact that the midfoot area is bit more snug. 

Primeknit is also less giving compared to the 3.0. Due to the knit material used, this does not have the sock like feeling which I didn't like anyways.

Overall, a great shoe and my new favorite. You can't go wrong with boosts!",New Favorite Ultra Boost!,DWG26
5,09/09/2017,"Perfect everyday comfort and a great minimal clean style. Very similar in feel to the Uncaged by slightly more snug around the mid-foot. You can create a bit more room in the shoe by removing the inner soles (especially good if you’re going with thicker socks). However over a couple of days it feels like the shoes has loosened slightly and has become even more comfortable. 

Running: Yes you can run in this shoe but I would not recommend anything over a couple of miles and certainly nothing that involved quick cuts or serious change in direction. I’m a very neutral with normal width feet (sz12) and while they feel a little snug at first, they quickly feel too loose on a relatively fast run. In short they feel less of a serious running shoe than the Ultraboost and the Ultraboost uncaged (no surprises there). Of course how many Ultraboosts do you see out running?

Aesthetics: The Laceless is a totally different aesthetic than the standard Ultraboost and Uncaged. Comparing them is a little tough but the Laceless feel overall more modern and minimal. Almost Apple-like in its rethink of what a shoe could be.",Incredibly comfortable with a similar feel to the Ultraboost Uncaged.,DWG26

4,11/06/2017,"These have been great for running, I love the arch support and the level of cushion. I have a very high arch and I love the floating arch. I think I might be the only person who preferred the deeper fit and higher back of the original pure boost. That style was more natural feeling on my foot, like I wasn’t wearkng a shoe at all. The flexible knit upper on this shoe is great, albeit shallow compared to the old pure, but much negated by the weird hard plastic cage thing around the midfoot. These run a bit long for me, so the cage will press on my baby toe a little. I can notice it when I run but it doesn’t bother me as much running as it does when I’ve worn these around. 
Overall my favorite running shoe right now but my dream shoe would be the original

2,10/16/2017,"I liked the X design of these shoes as it was different/unique. However like written in several reviews, the cut out takes away from arch support. After putting these on and walking around in them, my arches/heel started to hurt so I returned them. I have a pair of the regular UltraBoost and love them. Wished the purple color came in the original UltraBoost style. 

These shoes may work if you don't need arch support, but I found them to be not comfortable just walking in let alone run in. Def try these on and walk around in the store for a bit before purchasing.",Doesn't support like regular UltraBoost,DWG12

As a result it causes a corn on my forth toe as it rubs on the little toe. This shoe is amazing. It is the only shoe that weights almost nothing, and offers amazing protection, zero rubbing.

5,09/18/2017,I strike mostly with my mid-foot and this shoe absorbs the impact beautifully but at the same time still makes you feel the road. I could see this being my go to shoe for long runs. Short - I still prefer the Adizero Adios. ;),Great running shoe that absorbs tons of impact.,DWG12
5,09/14/2017,"I don't do much of any running, but I do stand a lot for my job and like to walk around Atlanta on my days off. These have been great support for my feet. I do recommend sizing up one. I'm almost ALWAYS a 6.5, but I had to get a 7. These are tight, and I have pretty narrow feet. No complaints other than the fact that I have to wear lower socks because of the way the top of the shoe hugs your ankle. These are very stylish and are currently my go to every day shoes.",Great Support,DWG12
5,09/12/2017,"I love love love this shoe. I'm a marathoner (though not currently training) and currently run 4-5 miles several times a week at moderate pace. It's supportive, lightweight, molds to your feet, and is all around very comfortable. It's a tighter fit and feels similar to wearing socks. Not to mention, this shoe is extremely stylish, which I find can be hard to find among good running shoes.

I was initially skeptical because of the unattached cage, but find that it doesn't hinder my running at all.

Note that this is not a stability shoe, it's better for neutral strides. I wear them with Powerstep insoles and it works wonders for me.",Like running on clouds,DWG12

2,09/07/2017,"Very cute shoes, got a lot of compliments, but they KILLED my feet when I ran in them (which is why I bought them). I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of running shoes before, they usually fell good the first run. Not these...I went on 5 runs and the last one I had to walk home because my foot hurt so bad. It hurt on the outside ball of my foot, only on one side. Needless to say, they were returned.",Hurt my feet!,DWG12

2,09/06/2017,These were made for women who run but the arch is too high (I have normal arches) and the material is too tight. They do feel like you get a bounce in them but it really is not made for running. I run 3 miles 2 times a week on sidewalk pavement.,Not a real running shoe,DWG12
3,09/02/2017,"These are super chic and comfortable trainers, but that being said, they're not a performance running shoe. I also found they weren't structured enough for weight lifting/HIIT (not enough ankle stability). I think these could work for walking/jogging, but if you're a serious runner, you should know they're way too heavy for speedwork. The bootie is also not super snug like Nike flyknit, so you slosh around a lot, and because of the weight of the shoe, I found this really impacted my stride. If you're looking for a great looking shoe to kick around in, these are perfect, but after around 200 miles in them, I just don't think they're a great running shoe.",Not super functional,DWG12
1,08/28/2017,"I'm not a hard core runner but I like to run 4-5 miles a few times a week. I was in the market for some new running shoes and thought I would give these a try cause they look so awesome in pictures. They felt heavy compared to my past shoes and the back heel is gigantic, there was at least an extra inch of material behind where my heel would end, which pushes the rest of the foot forward as you run. I thought maybe that extra heel was for more support but then about 2 miles into my run all of a sudden the heel caught and I rolled my ankle pretty bad. Took the shoes off and walked home barefoot. So if you are buying these shoes for running please save your money. If you are buying them cause you think they ""look cool"" and want to wear them around town, probably fine.",Dont waste your money,DWG12

I purchased UB 4.0 because it has some of the UB 1.0 pattern with additional parallel lines running from toe to heel which I'm not a fan of. To me that ruined the otherwise perfect pattern.

The insole feels thicker then usual but didn’t seem to bother me. There’s still room in front of my toes but the right amount. I compared them to my 1.0 versions. They feel almost the same. I’m sure I could have gone true to size but going down a half size didn’t hurt.

I had to buy a new pair after reaching the limit of my previous pair but unfortunately after three days wearing them I arrive to this conclusion: the new Primeknit upper wraps is way too rigid and heavier.

I have the right size in term of length and width so I was a bit confused since there should not be any difference with my previous pair.

So when I heard about a more durable Ultraboost, that was a mid, I knew I had to buy them. I have had them for about two weeks now and they fix a lot of the issues the old Ultraboost had. The heel is far more secure. You can wear them lose and do sports because the mid heel. They have inside padding making them far more comfortable. The sole is more grippy and seems to be higher quality. The cage is gone so you won't get scratches and the thing that says Ultraboost at the back of the shoe is made of a more scratch resistant materiel.

I bought them a week ago and just ran 5 miles on the beach. What a horrible experience, they were soft and comfortable on my 20 yard walk to the beach. Thats where the fun stops, after that I was not sure I could finish. The lateral support in the toe box is so bad that in both directions ( running out and back ) both my left foot and my right foot were rolling over the edge of the shoe. I honestly thought the material would tear out on my first run.

5,10/12/2017,I love these shoes so much that I purchased all three color ways! So comfortable and loving the uncaged looked with the raised three bars.

5,10/05/2017,"I ordered and recently received the core black and burgundy Ultra Boost ATRs. First impression out of the box was it looks and feels premium. As for me, it does not feel tight or snug and feels similar to the regular 3.0. I even compared it to a 3.0 by wearing each on each foot. I was even surprised that the ATR's felt more comfortable on my heels only to find out that there is more foam like padding inside around the heel cup. In terms of tightness around the midfoot area, they felt very similar to loosely tied 3.0. To top things off, the outsole seems to be three times as thick. I have unworn 3.0 three grey's that looked like it had a bald or worn out outsold compared to these. I will attach pictures to show you what I mean. Overall happy with these shoes and well worth the price considering the very thick outsoles that will last a very long time.",Premium,DWG38

5,10/01/2017,"I had some doubts before ordering this shoe as I was worried that the water resistant film would make the Primeknit less soft and it doesn't have a traditional exterior cage. Worry no more. The primeknit is still soft and incredibly comfortable. Where you would normally find the cage of a regular UltraBoost there is integrated support within the 3 stripes, which helps keep the upper snug to your foot. The mid collar is very stretchy and doesn't hinder your ability to slip the shoes on. The continental sole seems about twice as thick as a traditional UltraBoost shoe.",Impressed!,DWG38

4,10/26/2017,"I struggle to find good running shoes. I settled on these abot a year ago, and they have served me well. They have not caused shin splints or blisters (as some other shoes I tried have). However, they are not holding up well. I have put just under 300 miles on them, and they have holes forming in the inner heel, the traction is GONE, and the road is now eating into the energy boost sole as I run. I dont see how these are comparable to tire rubber, as I should have been able to put more miles on them before retiring them (especially for the $140 I paid) . Also, they feel cheeply made. Some of the stitching seems incomplete and the lining unfinished. I accepted this over time as a consequence of the shoes being so light. They are the lightest shoes I have ever owned. They are breathable. And they do hold my foot securely as I run. Unfortunately, another issue is that they are a pain to get on. A complete pain! With no pull tab in the back, I find myself attempting to get them on over and over, and crushing my fingers as I try to pull them open with forcing my foot in. The heel ends up folding in under my foot, and I have to try again. It is unpleasant, and could be easily fixed with a pull tab. Another complain is the Suede material used on the toe and front of the shoe. It collects so much dirt. I have scrubbed my shoes clean, went for one run, and came back with them looking just as bad as before I cleaned them. (And I mostly run on pavement). Also, the laces have stretched a bit and are so long that I have to triple tie them so they don’t drag the ground. Overall I give 4 stars because they have served my purposes of a supportive running shoe, are good for sprints and long distance, attractive, prevent common injuries in long distance runs, and are good enough for me to buy a second pair to break in before a half marathon.",Good for running,KEK85

5,10/10/2017,"This is the ideal shoe for training and racing if you're looking for a lighter shoe with a neutral fit. It's lean and light, yet provides ample protection. The only issue I have is that the side of the tongue can get bunched up and cause pressure points on the inner top side of the foot; you have to remember to smooth the tongue inside the shoe as you put the shoe on. I have a hard time finding performance shoes that fit properly, and these felt perfect when I first tried them on - like Cinderella and that magic slipper. Good lacing system enables custom fit and no heel sloppiness. They have good aeration so you won't get excessive sweat and they dry quickly (removable sock liner, too). I just retired a pair at 921 miles - a bit more than I'd recommend wearing them for.

Nothing wrong with lower drop shoes, but I wanted a standard drop 10-12mm, and I really don't think this stack height description is accurate.

Everyone compares boost to the ultraboost for running, but I have to say that I would take these any day. The Boston 6 is super light! Even for a shoe with boost. I didn't notice the boost ""in every step"". Rather, I noticed how great my feet and legs felt after a run as compared to other clunky running shoes. It was as if I didn't have to try as hard to pick up my feet after striking the ground. The shoes really protected my joints!

4,10/08/2017,These shoes are just beautiful: aesthetically they're one of the best pair of shoes I've bought. Quite narrow (although that's nice in a running shoe) and a little small (so I've had to send these back and order the larger size so fingers crossed). The grip on the sole is extensive and perfect for slippy conditions and the mesh on the side might make them very breathable if not-waterproof.,Looking forward to getting the larger size,CDB65

We get rainbows and men get the sleek, unassuming ""cool"" shoes. Well needless to say, i am very happy with this purchase. The color is a cool oatmeal - not white. Which is fine for me, i love them. And also the other reviews are correct. these run BIG. I ordered 1/2 size down (i wear a 6.5 so i ordered a 6) and the fit is still roomy enough so that they fit but I can comfortably wear socks with them when needed.

If you are close to needing the next size in what you normally where definitely consider going up. I have done a couple of trail runs in theses. The grip is fantastic.

I know adidas in no way advertised them as water resistant or anything of the sort, but ""weather resistant"" makes it seem as if it would at least repel water slightly. The upper *absorbs* water so this unfortunately will not suit my winter needs. The length of the shoe is a bit long and the width is a bit narrow (compared to Ultraboosts in the same size). The traction in person was as aggressive as the pictures depict, and the Continental rubber compound only enhances that. I wouldn't recommend this for the winter, but would without a doubt recommend them for the fall.",Lots of Potential,BDZ11

Such a disappointment. I am preparing for my 3rd half marathon and previously have been running in the ADIDAS ULTRABOOST that were amazing.

3,08/26/2017,"I like nearly everything about these except that the tongue of this shoe tends to shift on me a lot no matter how tight I tie the laces. I find myself stopping to readjust it often during my intense 2 hour workouts. I've worn these for HIIT, kickboxing, cycling, Zumba and gym boot camps so far. I have narrow ankles, wide toe base and flat feet. Shoe provides great arch support. They do not collapse while wearing these. My feet stayed unusually cool due to the awesome ventilation design across top of toe box area. These breath so well and would be great in a hot area. Only suggestion is they should've designed a thicker shoe tongue Or made it not move like on my Adidas ultra Boost shoe. I don't regret buying these but glad I didn't pay full price. Choose ultra boost over these if you can only get one pair of shoes.",A cheaper alternative to purchasing the traditional Adidas Ultra Boost shoe,CDD21

When I first tried them on, and when I first walked them through their initial week long break-in, they were the most comfortable shoes I had ever worn. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking if I only brought these shoes on my trip to NYC I'd be a happy camper. Sadly, I wore these shoes for 3 days straight walking extensively through NYC and surrounding areas, and found my feet and ankles extremely swollen, my heels rubbed raw, my toes blistered, and by the third day was ready to throw them into the Hudson River as I couldn't bear to take another step in these shoes. The flight back home was sans shoes while on the plane as just looking at these shoes made me cringe.

I ordered them and when I received them I compared them to my old Thrashers. They are the same model and fit great. I'm super happy to find these.

5,06/16/2017,"These are my favorite shoes and when ADIDAS takes breaks from making them, I fall into deep depression. 

Okay not really, but here's why I think they're great. I overpronate and have PFS in both knees, so I wear orthotics and choose my shoes carefully. The extra grip of these shoes is perfect for giving me added stability where my knees lack it. The curved front is great for helping me flex my ankle more fully and for staying on the balls of my feet more, also helpful on the knee problems. I have proportionally narrower heels, and it's incredibly comfortable and well-fitting tkchave the backs come up higher- no blisters or chafing like some shoes. They are not the lightest weight shoe out there, but they are firm and sturdy and make me feel sure of every step- trail, sidewalk, or treadmill. They also last a ridiculously long time, despite my attempts to destroy pairs that are too old for running in sports, camping, and other activities.","A sturdy, stable shoe",KEJ77

I would choose the larger one you can fit into. Also the sole of this shoe must have like heightened spots on the bottom for optimum running potential.

4,10/06/2017,Awesome shoes. Very comfortable. They come a tiny bit bigger. I got a size 8. But I actually liked how I had a little more room. It's not like they made your feet look big/awkward. Very nice shoes!,Very nice shoes,CDC30

4,10/20/2017,"bought to replace runners.
i'm usually a 7.5 in adidas, so bought a 7.5, but thought it was a smidgen too short. because of the techfit upper, my big toe sort of stuck up through the fabric despite having 1/2 inch to an inch of room, which felt weird. i'm returning them and ordering an 8 because i really want these to work. the overall fit is nice and snug, which i think takes some getting used to if you wear more traditional sneaks. 
can't say what they feel like running until i receive the 8s, but they feel light and supportive. 
can't wait!","super comfy, but 1/2 size small",CDC31

4,11/17/2017,"I own both women size 6 regular uncaged, and the men size 5 parley uncaged. Lengths of the two pairs are almost the same. However, the parley is much tighter, I think this is because they are using a different material for the upper.",Very comfy only that it's tighter than regular uncaged boost.,CDI86
5,10/28/2017,"Great on runs and as fashionable like my NMD's. Wore this on my flight back from Portland to LA for a 2.5 hour flight. Due to it being new, the Mid foot was a bit tight and you feel it after seating for that long. Parley uncaged needs break in period. I only felt that tightness after seating that long, but when I started walking again tightness to my midfoot disappears. 
The boost is excellent. I have NMD R1, R2 and Pureboost DPR.  The Parley is definitely a running and lifestyle shoe.  The boost on the Parley felt the more bouncy than my other boost - keeping you in full comfort both running and walking.  
It is lifestyle as well as you have so many options to lace this. I wanted 3 (adidas) lace to stand out and I was able to do it with lacing. 
I have wide feet 9.5, and I got 9.5 and it is true to fit. Get a half size larger (for wide feet) if you plan more on just walking around this and you love your wiggle room for your toes.  Having wore this for 8 hours, with 2 straight hours of standing - this by far the most comfortable Adidas boost.",Snug fit that needs breaking in period,CDI86

4,10/20/2017,Love the look of this shoe. Pretty narrow last combined with the knit makes it fitted. Suggest sizing up 1 or even 1.5 if you don't like a snug toe box. The size 11 in these are the same length as the size 10 in the Pureboost.,Cool but fitted,CDI86

4,06/09/2017,"This is a very light shoe with an awesome colour. I can hardly tell I'm wearing them. They do run slightly small (my usual size was okay lengthwise, but too tight - feet would be numb after an hour of wearing them, due to poor circulation), so I'd recommend 1/2 a size bigger than usual. The difference might not be that noticeable when it comes to length, but it will be regarding the tightness of the shoe. They do adjust to your foot in time - I think the material stretches slightly, but no so much that they would be too big all of a sudden. When running in them, they give you a bit of a spring. They are also great for longer walks. I would definitely recommend this shoe.",Very happy with my purchase.,CDI86
4,06/09/2017,"Really nice looking - probably the best colour I've seen for the Ultra Boost Uncaged 3.0.

5,06/03/2017,"Adidas Ultra Boost it's where I stopped in searching the perfect shoes for my runs even though they might not be comfortable for few times ( as it was for me with my first ultra boost pair ) until your feet will get used with these tight fit like a sock kinda shoes. I selected comfort Ok because they're perfect for your runs but if you'll buy'em thinking they'll be awesome for your daily casual day by day wear you'll be wrong and I would sugest to go for Adidas Pure Boost in that case since they're more loose and therefore more comfortable for big amount of time wear.

4,05/22/2017,"Impractical but looks good.  It's also less stretchy/flexible than its non-parley counterparts.  
***It also runs half a size smaller.

I ended up returning mine, but in large part because I did not read that they ran extr small.  Needless to say I was rushing to buy them even though these didn't sell out as fast as the UB Parley.","Interesting, but complicated to find best fit",CDI86

1,05/22/2017,The design is way too narrow if you have normal feet,"I wouldn't recommend these as a day to day pair of shoes, it's not at all breathable so they make your feet sweat constantly",CDI86

5,05/21/2017,"Parley for the win, the shoe is very comfortable as any ultraboost. The concept behind the shoe is awesome, my only complaint is that they fit smaller than ultraboost 3.0, more like 2.0, so I had to take the insole out otherwise was to snug for me. Adidas I love  you but get your sizing right for once!!!",Great addition to the collection,CDI86

4,05/21/2017,"Little tighter than regular ultra boost, I'm sure it will break in.",Best Recycled Shoe,CDI86
4,05/21/2017,"The Boost sole is great and comfy, however I hate the practice of shoes that run small (which this shoe does). If it's known that a shoe is a half-size (or any size for that matter) small, the sizes for the shoe should be shifted instead of putting the burden on the consumer to get the right size.","Comfy shoe, looks nice, too small",CDI86
3,05/21/2017,"The shoe feels a little too tight, and didn't quite look like the photo",Try on a bigger size!,CDI86
4,05/21/2017,For my 1st lair of uncaged the shoe kinda digs into the back of my ankle but i think once it loosens up it should fit fine. Appearance and for the most part it is comfortable.,Good experience and i am satisfied with my purchase.,CDI86

1,05/21/2017,"great looking shoes, but as a person who has worn Adidas his entire life, i am very dissapointed with this product. I ordered the right size but after wearing it once my ankle is swollen. I tried removing the soles but it didn't work either. They are extremely tight and uncomfortable. I cannot return it since I threw the box away, cause I though it's adidas and I will never have any problems with it.",Not happy,CDI86

2,05/20/2017,"I really loved these shoes until I tried to put them on, I ordered my normal ultra boost size which all fit perfectly but these were very small and tight I even tried them without the insole but they were still too small, I would like to return for a bigger size but they are all sold out.",run very small,CDI86

1,05/19/2017,I have over 20 pairs of Ultra Boost in both caged and uncaged. This round of Parley's are uncomfortably tight. I had to return the caged and uncaged I secured on release day. Very disappointed that I was hyped on this project and the shoes are nothing like my other 3.0's or Uncaged's. Can Adidas confirm the disconnect in this model? Will they stretch out or is it because of the recycled ocean plastics the fit is different?,Too Snug,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Most comfortable shoes in my collection because of the ultraboost technology.Always a big fan of the boost. Recommend to go 0.5 size up.,Worth the price tag.,CDI86
5,05/19/2017,"The parley edition, food to see use of plastic found in ocean",So comfy,CDI86
4,05/19/2017,"This was my first experience with Ultra Boosts, and after having read countless reviews, I have to say they were a little less comfortable than I imagined (probably due to ridiculously high expectations I had) but still very comfortable nonetheless. I am still suffering from a chronic knee injury which has prevented me from running for a long time, and I was hoping these would be the shoes that I would use to slowly ease back in. I think the uncaged style makes them more of a lifestyle shoe than a running shoe, and my toes feel like they might pop out from the front.
The sizing is definitely off - I wear a UK5.5 for Stan Smiths and they fit perfectly. I went a half-size up and they are quite tight, but I'm sure they will stretch out a little after a couple of wears. I also have a relatively high arc which makes these shoes a little difficult to put on, even with the laces loose.
I do, however, LOVE the initiative behind these shoes - I think Adidas should definitely produce more sustainable products and make them the norm, rather than special releases.","Great initiative, great (lifestyle) shoe!",CDI86
5,05/19/2017,Great shoe would recommend going up half a size in this,Clean shoe great design and concept,CDI86
4,05/19/2017,They look good on the feet. Very comfortable to run in.,They are a little more snug than primeknit uppers. Design I feel is better.,CDI86

5,05/18/2017,First pair of any Adidas in a very long time. These are the single most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet. Not to mention they look incredible and are made sustainably while cleaning our oceans. Love every single thing about these.,Blown away.,CDI86
2,05/17/2017,"Quality shoes, but holy smokes they're uncomfortable. The Parley Uncaged is super, super tight on the bridge of the foot. So tight that it cut of both my circulation and my brother's. Length and width are perfect so I don't think moving up a size would be advisable. The other Uncaged I have worn aren't a problem, but the Parley colorway is super uncomfortable. Go caged or if you want Uncaged, go with another colorway.",Parley colorway is way too tight on bridge of foot—much worse than previous iterations of Uncaged.,CDI86
3,05/17/2017,"I was incredibly excited to find that my shoes had arrived. But, turns out they are TOO TIGHT. I am size 12 in Ultraboost so i figured ordering half a size bigger would differentiate this particular shoe's size. Disappointed.",Awesome cause. disappointing sizing.,CDI86
1,05/15/2017,"The Parley shoes are too TIGHT. I have the same size of UltraBOOST Uncaged Shoes, which are so perfect and comfortable. They shouldn't have this kind of difference, right?",,CDI86
2,05/15/2017,Just received my new Adidas in the mail.  Was super excited until I tried them on and noticed the middle of the inner sole was not properly glued in and created this uncomfortable slack/bump which I felt when walking.  Disappointed with the poor build quality.  Will return for a refund.,Disappointed with my purchase!,CDI86

I would definitely recommend these to a friend just because these are going to sell out and people are going to regret not getting them.",Best uncaged I've owned,CDI86
1,05/13/2017,"Make More Regular Ultra Boost!!! I love Adidas and Ultra Boost, but you are missing the mark on the product demand. The regular Ultra Boost is preferred by customers who buy them for running, but you can NEVER find them. Case and point Parley Ultra Boost sold out in 10 minutes and you can still get Uncaged Ultra Boost 3 days later. It is extremely frustrating. If you start shopping when you have 200 miles on your shoes, it is doubtful that you will find a pair before you break 300 miles. Uncaged run too small and are not nearly as good for running! Listen to your customer demand. Shift supply from Uncaged to Regular Ultra Boost",Make More Ultra Boost & Less Uncaged!!,CDI86

1,11/27/2017,"Bought these shoes for my son. In addition to his regular everyday activities; He also participates in the 100 mile Club and runs about 10miles a week. After only 3 weeks of wearing the shoes with the above mentioned wear and tear, the shoe began to show early signs of dilamination of the the plastic/rubber material from the shoe fabric in the front of the shoe. This is definitely a production issue where the glue used is substandard or wasn’t applied properly. Upon discovering the issue we contacted Adidas customer service and informed them that the shoe was falling apart. Instead of standing by their product and offering a refund or a replacement, we were advised to go back to where we purchased the shoe, “Finish Line”. Unfortunately, at Finish Line they only offered us a credit for the current price of the shoe. Which was $25 less than what we paid for. I’m usually impressed with the adidas that I purchase due to the amount of wear and tear I can put on the shoes from running, hiking, or trail work. Unfortunately, this time the product failed and Adidas didn’t care to standby their product.",Poor product construction/development,BEG77

3,03/21/2017,"This is my first Adidas x Parley purchase ever, and I must say that I'm disappointed by what I receive. The design is great, the cause is amazing, but the execution doesn't live up to my expectation. I've spotted:
- 3 holes in the Boost material (2 are pictured)
- 2 stains in the Primeknit material (1 is pictured)
- 2 areas with loose thread (1 is pictured)
- 1 area with uneven stitching (pictured)
- Scratched box (pictured)
I really wanted to love this pair, as I had been waiting for it to release. After I was notified, I hopped online immediately to get one. I really hope that it's just my pair that is faulty. Even though personally I'll return it, I'll still recommend this product to my friends because of the cause it supports.","1/2 size up for thick socks, 1 size up for wide feet",CEM26

4,12/05/2017,Great style and and very comfortable right out of the box. Love the colors and the material. That being said they are definitely more of a fashion shoe than a running shoe.

5,11/03/2017,"I have worn these for about 4 months now, running in the shoes 5 days a week. They have held up great, just some marks on the front where the upper material has scraped the ground. They make you feel like you have springs on your feet.
I will say that if you are planning on standing on your feet for the entire day, they can begin to hurt you feet because there is not much support.
But overall a must buy for style and running capabilities.",,DWH89

4,09/14/2017,"This unique version of ""Night Cargo"" is dark olive interlaced with a shade of flesh (from a distance, this colorway gives the illusion of brown).  Combined with a black midsole, it's a conservative looking running shoe that's attractive with almost any clothing and works in almost any athletic or social situation.  However, there's a couple of spots of white stitching on this colorway that stick out like a sore thumb...making it look like I repaired a tear with dental floss!  

There's no insole included...which wouldn't be an issue if there was more arch support.  There is some light arch support designed into the shoe's frame, but it's not quite satisfactory even for my medium arches.  The included extra laces are unnecessary garbage and, imo, should be replaced with optional medium-arched insoles.

The polyester knit upper is more breathable than most shoes, but still a little humid in summer.  However, I actually prefer this basic knit because it's more supportive than ""primeknit"".  Increasing this support is pureBoost's lacing system (which includes internal/hidden mid-foot straps)...when laced snug, it just feels much more ""locked in"" than even the more high-end Boost models.

I had reservations about the ""burrito"" tongue.  It can bunch up when putting on the shoe, but, once straightened out (easy), it feels completely un-noticeable.   This version of burrito tongue is different/better than burrito tongues on other brands...I think it's actually better than even the old standard-type tongues.

There's no padding on the ankle collar, which might matter if you run a lot.  The heel-cup is excellent...but, if you don't lace snugly, you might get slight ""heel lift"".

Boost is among the best sole cushioning I've ever felt in a running shoe (and I've tried most of the ""maximalist"" brands).",welcome to the future,DWH89

If you have a narrow foot, this would not be the right shoe for you.  My foot is in-between normal and wide and it feels like I have lots of room for my toes, more than it would in a ladies shoe.

3,07/19/2017,"The shoe looks great, although after my first run in these the black boost got caked with a layer of dirt, so I had to wash that off, and that took extra time which I should have seen coming. After my second run, I was walking home when the outside tendon below my right ankle began to hurt a lot, and it sidelined me for about a week. I believe that it was due to the fact that the collar digs into your foot on the outside in general, but it especially does so on turns.

3,11/06/2017,"First off what I love, the upper 3m material and flash effect is amazing, and the thicker Continental bottom outsole is great. And I would love to see both features on a normal ultraboost. 

The comfort is great. I liked the extra padding on the sides and ankle. And dispite the unpopularity, I like the tongue on these. However the sizing is still frustrating. I had to go a half size down. I have a wide foot and wear 11 in eqt and nmd. But the 10.5 in these and the wool series ultraboost fit me perfectly. 

What I disliked were the off color grey laces. I liked that they were round laces but should of been 3m to match or black in color at least. The boost on mine around the hard plastic parts were slightly not painted and you could see a little white. At the high price point should have a higher quality control inspection. 

The high collar and I believe uniquely to my pair of shoes I really dislike. So much if I were able to exchange for another pair I would immediately but it's not option with super limited number release and this is the reason I could NOT give this shoe a 5 star rating. The high collar on the Left is more a white color and more like the example pictures. However, the Right pair looks like they used the same material for the uppers. So basically the left looks white and other collar looks black land looks like I'm wearing mismatched socks.",Amazing 3m look but the collar has issues.,DWG39

Ankle collar fits really nice and is not too restrictive. This shoe has 3m reflective all throughout the PK something adidas did not advertise (see picture). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the price is wayyy too high. Adidas prices are out of control at this point and I think it is a strategy to put off resellers but it really hurts the consumer.,"Another great UB, but the price hurts",DWG39

The Water Resistance of them is excellent. 1 major thing Adidas left out of the description is they r 3M. When I went to take a pic of them on foot, the Flash on my cam made them Bling back at me. They look great on foot as well. These may be my fav pair of Adidas of all time. That’s saying something as I’ve got about 35pair of Adidas n about 20 are some Version of Ultraboost. The rest being NMD/EQT or something else. I highly recommend u buy a pair of these if u can find them in ur size. I’m not on the hunt for another size 12 so I can double up.

5,10/25/2017,"First of all, I didn't get this shoe for running in on any trails or even on tarmac. I can't speak to that. What I can speak to is it's comfort on foot, sizing, and looks. Firstly it's extremely comfortable. It's snug like a 2.0 but comfortable like a 3.0. The primeknit is amazing. Slightly thicker than 3.0. The support around the angle is next level. The sole is thicker and to me, feels more comfortable all round than a 3.0. I wear these with jeans mostly and they look awesome.

1,09/05/2017,So I'm about 30 miles into these shoes and the only thing they are good for is running on a flat hard packed dirt road. The upper is way too soft and stretchy any side to side movement and the upper will stretch basically to the point the side of your foot hits the ground. For being called an all terrain shoe these are far from it. Every time I wear these on a trail that is even the slightest bit technical I roll my ankle multiple times because the upper is not strong enough or sturdy enough. The sole is good and provides a soft but responsive run but isn't the shoe I was hoping for. Hopefully adidias fixes this in later models,Not worth the price,DWG39

Great suppport too.....I always buy a half size bigger than usual, just in case I need thicker socks, but with any socks - they still feel perfect.
They are definitely worth the expense.",Best comfort ever !,DWI04

5,12/03/2017,"The shoe feels like exactly what I was looking for: a running shoe with complete barefoot flexibility, for landing mid/front. I think the issue with the sizing most people have can be solved by purchasing higher-end lightweight socks. I first used my standard sneaker socks, and indeed the Adios was too tight. But, then I figured I could upgrade my socks, and problem solved. Maybe that's what Adidas was thinking?",Comfortable Lightweight and Flexible,KEK81
5,12/02/2017,The shues are very CONFORTSBLES  ELEGANCE AND PERFEVT FIT,VERY HAPPY,KEK81
5,12/02/2017,"The Adios 3 are great for road runs at any speed. They are lightweight and have ample cushioning to help you run faster. Looks wise, they have a retro feel with some modern technologies mixed in, giving the shoe a sleek appearance. Fit wise, go true to size or half size up since the toe-box is a bit snug. The durability on the Adios 3 is pretty decent, the upper is made from a mesh and suede construction, keeping your foot locked down during runs. The Boost midsole makes each step feel energized and the cushioning doesn't deteriorate that much over time. Overall, this is a great shoe for training and races!",Great performance running shoes!,KEK81
5,12/02/2017,"I was introduced to this model a little more than a year ago by my local running store, and it's been a revelation and game changer for me. The shoe is light, fast, responsive and comfortable enough because of the Boost material to be a Race Day shoe for 5k to road marathons. I've PR'd in all the distances in the past year in no small part because of this shoe. I have so much confidence in the fit, grip and ride of this shoe that I don't even have to think about whether to buy more. I can't think of a more perfect racing shoe.  

At the recommendation of my LRS I sized up about a half size, and it gives my forefoot just enough extra room for the splay and slight swelling that occurs over a marathon distance. 

The only regret that I have about this shoe is that the outsole tends to wear through to the torsion plate at less than 300 miles for me. I know this is because of my slightly supinating footstrike, and I don't fault the design of the shoe and its choice of materials.",My Go-To Race Day Shoe,KEK81
5,11/15/2017,"It's my second pair of adios boost and I just like them so much, they make me run faster and feel very comfortable. These shoes are very responsive, perfect for racing and running fast but still enough comfort to do your longer runs too (ran a marathon with my previous pair). They're like the best of both worlds","These shoes are made for running, fast!",KEK81
5,11/13/2017,Have only tried them out once since my plan is to save them for races but I was very impressed with them. Super lightweight but still very bouncy and comfortable. I did a 5k Time Trial on the track with them and got a new PR. The shoe is very stylish and I love the colour.,Super lightweight fast shoe,KEK81
5,11/10/2017,"Having purchased Adios previously, I have consistently found the shoe to be light, quick, responsive and exceptionally durable. The fit is true to size, and the colours are true to the picture. These can be worn on race day for longer races, or as a lightweight trainer for most days (my go to shoe most days).",Love these shoes,KEK81

5,11/05/2017,"Awesome. Excercise/running oriented. 3rd pair of boost. Have stansmith boost and eqt boost. This is bit snug but still true to size. I wear 9.5-10 usually and this is just perfect. Definitely not sneaker loose fit style. Need to really lace it, of course its a running shoe. Great blue color pairs up with blue jeans",Great quality,KEK81
3,11/02/2017,"The shoes feel fast, and I like that they're lightweight and have the mesh upper that allows breathability. However it took a while to find the right fit since I have wider feet and these run narrow - I'd suggest ordering half a size up. 

Unfortunately the mesh material is not very durable - after just a month in these shoes the mesh upper started to tear near the right pinky toe, and every time I wear these shoes the hole gets visibly bigger. I'm doing marathon training at about 50+ miles per week (though I wear different shoes if I'm doing a slow easy run, so they don't take all my mileage), so I know that puts a lot of wear and tear on them. However, my first pair of Adios's had no issues as to the material durability, so I may have just received a defective product. It hasn't even been 2 months yet and now the fabric tear is at least 1.5 inches long. Unfortunately I'm 1 month away from our race, and it's probably too late to switch to a new shoe model, so I'm hoping my next pair that I just ordered actually holds up this time.","These run small, order half a size up",KEK81
4,11/02/2017,"Light. Comfortable. No injuries from poor fit. I started running in Adios series shoes three years ago. When they wear out, I just reorder in the latest colour.

5,10/19/2017,"I ordered a pair through Amazon and they recommended half a size larger. Good thing they did because they fit perfectly. I also ordered through Amazon because they had a version that was $40 less due to the color which is so horrible (Solar Red?!). Luckily, I don't mind the color for running shoes. Then Adidas lowered the price on the light blue ones and since I love the fit, I bought a pair of those. The colors I actually like (the black ones or white ones) are too expensive. But the shoes are incredible. They're light, sleek, breathable. I don't know how long I will be able to run with them, I run around 15 miles per week, but I have the purchase date and so when they're worn out I'll see. Good thing is I only use them for running because of the flamboyant color (I run very early in the morning). It's a shame because they are just so pretty. I would love to wear them with jeans but I don't want the shoes to attract the attention of helicopters flying overhead.",Excellent purchase.,KEK81

4,10/13/2017,"I love Adidas styling and product design. These shoes I bought for going to the gym, not for outdoor running. Although my feet are very standard and I always wear size 42, I got these shoes in size 42 1/3 this time and they still turned out to be too small and too tight for me. Besides that the strips of artificial suede on the nose and sides of the shoes will get soiled very quickly and so will the white foam soles. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase, except for the wrong size.",Great shoes but will not last for long.,KEK81
3,10/12/2017,I tried on a pair of Adidas Adizero Adios 3 at the Adidas store and 9.5 fit perfectly. I purchased the same shoe from Adidas.com and it was too big and uncomfortable. Need to return and try again. Sigh.,inconsistent sizing,KEK81
2,10/12/2017,I've worn a size 12 in this shoe for several years. They seem much smaller. I returned them with no hassle but I'm hesitant to even try a size 13 because the 12 felt at least 2 sizes too small.,Too small,KEK81

2,09/19/2017,"When I first bought this shoe, either it came laced or I laced it too tight. My feet would hurt after light runs or walks. I slowly kept loosening the laces all the way to the bottom and I finally found a really comfortable shoe.

I've owned these shoes for 6 months, and I would describe them as EXTREMELY worn. My dog ate my last running shoes (thanks Ada) and I started wearing these on walks about 3 months ago. The Continental sole was a selling point to me because I really enjoy their bicycle/car tires, but now I don't think they last. I don't have data to back this up, but I would break down my 6 months as such:

Month 1: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 2: ~12 miles running on pavement
Month 3: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bunch)
Month 4: <5 miles walking on pavement (too sore to use as daily walking shoes until I loosened them up a bit more)
Month 5: 130 miles walking on pavement, 20 miles running on pavement, 15 miles on dirt paths (dog ate other shoes, these are all I've got)
Month 6: 110 miles walking on pavement, 10 miles running on pavement, 30 miles on dirt paths (something feels off)
DONEZO!

I'm disappointed with this shoe. I was hoping for them to last at least a quarter of the time of my Nike Free running shoes, but they just didn't hold up. It's ok if they were meant for short distance grip, I just expected a bit more longevity.",A shoe that didn't last,KEK81
5,09/13/2017,These are great. Get half a size up! Quality. Nice!,Best trainers super comfy!,KEK81
4,09/10/2017,"These are excellent trainers. They're light, airy and they look fantastic compared to the garish coloured running trainers from other manufacturers. I've run over 300km in them so far (with individual runs over 30km) and I haven't received a blister yet. However, be very careful with the size. I'm consistently size 10, as measured in many shoe shops and running specialists, however I had to return my original size 10 orders and re-order a size 11. Note that I couldn't find a single high street stockist after searching four towns, so I couldn't try any on before buying.

There is also a minor quality issue (but one I wouldn't have expected given the high price). The lace retaining loops on the tongues are in completely different places on each shoe. This is shown in the attached photograph. On the right shoe the loop is between the third and fourth eyelets, and on the left shoe it's between the fourth and fifth.

Furthermore, there were no care instructions included with the trainers. I expected some to be provided.

Overall I would highly recommend these trainers, but if you can try some on and inspect the quality before buying, do so.","Excelent trainers, but be careful with size",KEK81

5,09/06/2017,"So, after reading all the previous comments I was concerned that by ordering them in my regular size they would be too small. I ordered them a half-size up and they were too big. I ended up ordering a second pair in my regular size and they were a perfect fit!

They are incredibly comfortable and light. I ran 20 miles with them the first day and had no soreness or fatigue - just an amazing shoe!

I see now why these are used by so many for marathon races and I will happily be sporting these for my next race coming up. Thanks, Adidas!

4,09/03/2017,"Don't know why Adidas makes almost ALL their shoes too narrow in the toe area. I see the same criticism in so many reviews for years for all sorts of shoes made by Adidas.

These shoes served me well for Boston and I have been using them in the months since, achieving PRs while still maintaining enough support and comfort - even on gravel trails I've had no issue.

3,05/05/2017,I had to go up into men's sizes as the women's ones are too small for me. They are fantastically comfortable shoes which I have been wearing in the gym for general training BUT they have worn out really quickly. The soles on both have split where the plastic arch stiffener embedded in the sole ends. This is a great shame as I loved the shoes and would make me very hesitant to buy another pair. I have never known any other trainers to fail in this way.,Comfortable BUT.....,KEK81

2,04/29/2017,"I've long been an adidas fan two two reasons: 1. they fit, and 2.the simple white & black schemes. About 4 years ago, they appear to have sized down ALL of their forms (all least in the soccer and running lines). So if you had a comfy pair you bought 5 years ago, GO AT LEAST A HALF SIZE UP. Also, if you don't want obnoxious colors, you'll have to go with the customized version, which, at considerable cost, will allow you to get rid of the obnoxiously bright colors. Once you get past that, they're a great, light, breathable shoe.",Long time buyers beware of major size changes.,KEK81

Depending on the model, I am usually a 9.5 or 10. I ordered a 10 however they felt big, so I ordered a 9.5 and they felt too tight. In short they felt uncomfortable.

I am not a runner, I only walk so the activity given to these shoes is minimum. For this amount of money I expected a much better built quality. I usually buy another brand, which I can't mention due to Adidas policies, and shoes with this price tag have last me 2-3yrs at least before they start wearing off, but this time I decided to give it a shot to Adidas and the rep at FinishLine was really compelling in regards to these shoes... well, TERRIBLE MISTAKE!

I’ve had to readjust multiple times to get the perfect fit. Where the plastic stripes are on the side, can feel a bit tight. Also, the flimsy laces slap my shoes for the entire run. Not a huge deal unless you have to hear that ticking noice for 13 miles.... but overall these are super comfortable, especially the soles and toebox. I have a bunion so the toebox room is the selling point for me.","Soles are very comfortable, hard to get laces right?",BEZ22

Am now ordering 1/2 size and full size smaller than I normally wear in a street shoe. My difficulty is that I wear a women's 11 street shoe, so very few, if any, retailers stock my size to try anything on. Adidas website had some colors of the energy boost at 30% off. No other online retailers had the discount (like Zappos, where I wouldn't be waiting 5 business days each time I have to order another size). Do appreciate that Adidas has free return shipping.

2,10/16/2017,"I have been wearing Adidas running shoes for 15 years. The original Energy Boosts were my absolute favorite, and I had 5 pairs of them. I am incredibly hard on my running shoes, so when I wore out the originals I tried the 2's - and they were so uncomfortable! Adidas had completely changed the proportions, so my high arched, narrow feet no longer felt supported. Anyway, I tried several different styles and ultimately went to another brand. 
When the Energy Boost 3's came out I was really excited and I decided to give them another shot... Now not only are they even wider than the 2's, but the sizing is COMPLETELY off. I have worn a 7.5 in Adidas for the last 15 years and these 7.5 Energy Boosts were a half size too big! I thought about exchanging them for a smaller size, but I don't even know if it's worth the aggravation.

2,08/12/2017,"I've used and been very satisfied with the former version Adidas Energy boost 3, which Ive had 3 pairs of in the past year. This new model is simply not as good as expected  according to advertisement. For a forefoot runner as I, the shoes cushioning were simply too soft making it feel like running in the sand. The boost, energy or extra kick they advertise about were simply not there. suddenly i ran 10 seconds slower per kilometer with these shoes. I wont recommend these shoes to anything else than recovery runs or fashion. P.s. the forefoot are a bit too wide which forced me to buy half a size smaller than energy boost 3. The shoes were comfortable - feeling like wearing socks.",Serious forefoot runners; avoid buying!,BEZ21

2,09/23/2017,"Bought these pair (Stella McCartney Ultraboost X Green) after reading ultraboost uncaged reviews. I thought they should be as comfortable. These are the worst shoes I've ever worn for running! I've run a half marathon in my cheap adidas coudfoam and I thought I was getting an upgrade in comfort with these shoes. I was mistaken. My feet were already hurting the first 20 minutes of running. Tried them again for another 4 mile run , then a 6 mile, then another 5 mile but my feet never adjusted to them. They just kept hurting my feet. I still love the design so I'll just use them for running errands. I'm still searching for the best pair of running shoes and have not given up on Adidas. I've tried Asics, Brooks, Nike, Saucony, Hoka, Under Armour for running and still keep going back to my ever comfortable Adidas Cloudfoam I bought for 40$ at Adidas Outlet store. Hope I find the right pair of Adidas before my next two half marathons which are scheduled this December and January.",Worst RUNNING shoes I've ever worn!,DWE90

3,09/04/2017,"I ordered them in my size, but they were very tight, especially around the midfoot. The boost material feels nowhere near as groundbreaking as the hype had me believe. It felt like the shoe interrupts blood circulation when my feet are at rest. The reinforced toe pushed against my toenails uncomfortably, and when I took it out for a test run its performance was underwhelming. It’s a nice looking shoe but the shape is not for me, and I will be returning them. Maybe my expectations for its comfort were too high, but then again I did pay 170 pounds for it. Overall, so-and-so.",UNDERWHELMING,DWE90

1,08/28/2017,"Of so many running shoes I own, sadly, this is the only pair that hurts my foot. The design is poor. The back of the shoe is curves up which is basically an unnecessary design flaw. The back isnt leather or some soft cushiony back you can break in too, but basically elastic rubber band material. It really dug into my foot and the only way to remedy it is to wear socks tall enough that go past the back of the shoe to cushion between the shoe and the skin. However, this means sacrificing style. Really disappointed and will not recommend this.","Shoe hurts, really bad design",DWE90
1,08/22/2017,"My true size is an 8, but it's a bit snug. The first couple of times I wore it my feet felt sore, like I lost circulation. But my biggest complaint is that there is a thread loose + the stitching is not as tight on the ankle, resulting in a hole. I've called and emailed Adidas but have not received a response, and am not happy with the lack of customer service.","Came with a hole in the knit, no response from Adidas",DWE90

5,08/04/2017,"Uncaged Ultraboost wasn't the highest on my list in choices to wear when compared to regular ultraboosts but the women's Stella McCartney Ultraboost is amazing. 

I love the way it fits snugly around my foot and it feels like it's meant to fit my foot perfectly.  It supports me perfectly at my arches while still feeling light and breathable. 

When running with them I feel light and supported and get really great traction on ground.

- Wasn't sure how gray they were, it's a very light gray. I consider them more off white than gray.

- They WILL develop creases across the toe box. Most shoes do, but these will be slightly more noticeable though.

- Feels average in weight and breathability. They are not as light as primeknit etc. 

- Quality of construction is better than average, and on the higher tier of adidas shoes.

- Walking and running it feels very good!

Bounce cushioning is far superior to boost in terms of long term comfort or all day wear. If you are a hypebeast who works on your feet, you just found your ideal everyday shoe. Looks amazing with jeans and sweats and performs at the level of a high end performance shoe. If you wear Ultra Boosts BEWARE, these fit a FULL size down from the Ultra boost.

4,09/01/2017,"My overall opinion of the PUREBOOST was that the comfort was similar to that of the primknit NMD r1.

1,09/27/2017,"I am a HUGE Ultra Boost shoes fan. I’ve never had anything negative to say – they’re beautiful, comfortable and great quality (at least I thought so). I’ve purchased 4 different colors/versions over the past two years but I’ve never purchased a Parley shoe until now. It’s VERY evident that Adidas sacrificed quality for looks on these. Within just a few wears, the heel/back of my shoes were completed RIPPED. I’ve never had this issue with the regular Ultra Boosts… The inner lining is made out of a different material on the Parley models, which feels weaker and much thinner than the regular models. Now I can’t even wear my Parleys because all they do is give me blisters…

4,07/23/2017,"I am 6'5"" , 225, and nobody has ever called me el gato. I have no mechanical issues w my feet or stride . All I have ever wanted in a shoe was the equivalent of two pillows to bolt on my feet. Historically though, my heal strike would go right through the cushion of a soft shoe which was harder on my body than the harder mid soles. These are by far the softest shoe I have used that I don't crash through the padding. I am only running on dirt and caliche so cannot rate them on pavement. They are replacing my older ultra boost. They are softer than the old shoe but the fact that the old shoes held up so well encourages me as to if they will last.

As w all of the ultra boost I have owned, they will suck the sock off your foot if the sock is any thing but a tight fit because the heel fits loose",A very good shoe for anyone wanting a light cushioned ride,BEZ74

2,09/17/2017,"If you're planning to wear these with no-shows/with shorts, think again. They look pretty terrible if you don't have long pants on due to the cuff squeezing your ankle. They're pretty comfortable, I expected more from the boost but they're good for running in straight lines. If you're wanting to do something turn-intensive (e.g. basketball,) think again. These shoes have no horizontal support and, when quickly turning, the sole will slip out from under your foot due to the stretchy primeknit on the side. The boost wears pretty easily and looks kinda nasty, but other than that, they've held up pretty well. No frays or anything on the primeknit, which is nice.",Don't wear them very often.,FBN57

5,07/10/2017,"This is a review of the adidas Ultra boost uncaged 2.0.

The primary difference between the uncaged 1.0 and 2.0 is the 3D-printed heel cup and the introduction of some fresh new colorways.

I went to the adidas Employee Store in Portland and they (unfortunately) didn't have any ultraboost uncaged shoes in my size. I was able to purchase the last pair (size 9) at a footlocker.

In terms of fit, I'd go true-to-size. If you aren't too fond of a snug fit, going a half-size up is an option. You can really feel the boost in every step you take and the continental rubber tread has durability that is comparable to that of an overbaked cookie - no matter what you do to it, it just won't break.

In-person, the primeknit of the core black/grey colorway looks like a slightly darker version of the NMD_R1 Firestarter's primeknit. The laces look as if there was a tinge of purple applied to them as they are not the same shade as the primeknit upper.

Other than that, the Ultra boost uncaged 2.0 is a really nice shoe that I would most definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a lifestyle shoe that can also be used for athletics.

Great job adidas and keep the amazing products coming :)",Wow. Amazing shoe and worth the price,FBN57

5,12/02/2017,"This is by far my favorite style Adidas has debuted. I now have 3 pairs (black,blue, & pink). They are feminine yet great to train in!",My 3rd pair of Edge Luxes,KDO46
5,12/02/2017,Based on pass purchases I went half a size smaller. It was a great idea as this shoe is so comfy and a great value for money.,Excellent purchase,KDO46
5,12/02/2017,I bought these as I have 2 others in different colors. Black is a staple for my wardrobe. These shoes make my large size 9.5 feet appear smaller. The wide laces are different and unique.,Super comfy and get compliments all the time.,KDO46
5,12/01/2017,"I love this product! I use it for weight training and the stair master and it does excellent! The black also goes with every day errand running outfits! Cant beat the price too! Will be buying them again once I wear these ones out 
I bought an 8 and I am a size 8, these are true to size. 
They come with a second pair of silver laces in case you want to mix things up! Such a good find for the price.. don't discontinue them adidas",Great Gym shoe,KDO46
3,12/01/2017,The shoes are very light and I love the way they look. I would give 5 stars but I received them with a hole in the fabric on the top. Very disappointed.,"Love the shoes, not the quality.",KDO46
5,12/01/2017,I always size down a half size with ADIDAS as they tend to run big. Thesee were a little narrow at first but after about an hour stretched to comfort.,Great shoe!,KDO46

5,11/30/2017,Everything is always stylish and comfortable/great,Adidas are the best!!!,KDO46
3,11/29/2017,"The good side to this shoe is that it’s very light weight so it doesn’t get too uncomfortable. The reason why I reated this a 3 is because the botoms of the shoe are not very flexible. Because of that, once your foot hits the ground, its more like a thump. Everytime I go jogging whether its on the tredmill of outside, its just *thump thump thump*. They’re also very flat. I could wear these shoes like trainers. Running shoes are suppose to make you feel like you don’t have shoes on. This shoe makes sure you do.",Honestly could have been better.,KDO46
5,11/29/2017,"I put 5 stars so everyone can read. This is not a great shoe for a serious runner. The sock design seems cool, but if you run hard the laces will dig in to the top of your foot. If you had to buy them they would only be cool looking shoes that you can wear for light walking. They don't even have the support in the top to be a training shoe. Not for any serious workouts.",Worst Running shoe,KDO46

4,11/28/2017,"Super cute shoes, which make my feet look very small. I have not walked out with them on but so far, theyre pretty comfy. I normally wear a 6.5 so I ordered such. However at the bridge of my feet it is on the tighter side so it hurts a bit when I leave my feet in for too long. I have a higher foot arch so that may be why. I got the black ones and they look fantastic.",Runs a bit small,KDO46
5,11/22/2017,"I am so in love with these shoes!! They are beyond comfortable offering good arch support and comfort. 
I have a bunion on one foot and because the shoes are stretchy in that area it makes them unbelievably comfortable for me. I usually wear an 8 1/2 in tennis shoes but sized down to an 8 and they fit perfect with a thin sock. These are my new go to shoe!!",Obsessed with these shoes!!,KDO46

4,02/13/2017,I was a bit unsure of these trainers when I first put them on as the edges hurt my feet a little but as soon as I stood up they felt perfect.

Unlike most of Adidas's clown like colour designs (which I may add look like 12 year olds choose the colour combinations) and to top it off they go perfect with jeans. No strange proportions from the sides and from the front they are sleek. You can find something like this elsewhere BUT NOT with this leading edge technology.

The wider mesh and seam-free toe box were the selling points. I managed to wear them one month before a hole developed in the right bunion area. The sole as well also started wearing down in the heel area. Please note that I wear these for running for 30 minutes or walking now and then. Very disappointing quality. Yes, my large bunions may cause more stress to the fabric but a hole within one month is inexcusable low quality.",Comfortable and stylish but hole within one month,KDO46

When I saw them online I was instantly attracted to the style of these shoes but when I received them, I fell in love. The style is sooo unique. I've never had that kind on stretch material on a shoe before but that's what makes them soo comfy. This material literally hugs your feet.! These are perfect if you walk a lot or if you're constantly standing. I workout a lot so I'm always soar and these shoes help me walk without any discomfort. I wouldn't recommend them to work out because of the material the shoe is made of but I would definitely use them for everything else. The comfort level on this show is hard to explain but I was soo obsessed that I bought them in black as well. I ordered these shoes in a size 8 because that's my size most of the time but they fit me big so I got 7.5. So I would size them down half a size. Another thing about this shoe is that it is perfect for people with side feet because normally you have to mold your feet to fit the shoe but with this one, the shoe mold to your feet. Which is amazing.! I definitely recommend these.",Best purchase ever.!,KDO46

After having purchased and returned a very uncomfortable pair or nikes--the air max theas--I am overjoyed with the edge luxe and I'll continue to buy Adidas shoes from now on. I got them in white. They have a nice subtle beige design. Laces are awesome! Okay I'm obsessed with these shoes. BUY THEM!",Literally amazing. AMAZING. I'm obsessed!!!,KDO46

Since getting them I have even worn them to the gym and they worked great! I absolutely love these shoes and always get compliments!,I love these shoes!,KDO46
4,10/15/2016,"Comfortable and stylish product. The thin sock-like upper makes for a snug fit, but it is also a little too thin and I could see the outline of my toes through the upper material - needless to say there is little protection provided if anything drops on my feet. However, this means it is super breathable. Both plus and minus on this feature. Otherwise lovely shoes, would highly recommend.","Lovely, stylish, highly recommended",KDO46

3,10/13/2016,"The shoes got a hole in them within the first week of wearing them. Near the front of the shoe. I really love how these shoes feel, they are flexible, comfortable, and quite stylish. I'm super disappointed that this hole happened as soon as I wore them. They are athletic shoes and not just for show, so I feel like they should be more durable. Not sure how the hole happened.","Love how the shoes feel, but a hole happened near the front of the shoe as soon as I wore them. Cheaply made.",KDO46

5,10/01/2016,"Absolutely love these shoes. They're comfy, cute and stylish. I haven't tried my typical long distance runs in them but they kind of feel like a sock, while I like more of a hard support feel.

4,09/21/2016,"Love the gray! Very easy to get on and off. By the picture, the laces look like straps but they are tie laces. The thicker laces make it look cool. I have a very high arch so not much support there to be used for running or extensive training. Overall a very good sneaker for everyday use.",Love these!,KDO46
5,09/21/2016,These shoes are so comfortable!! They silhouette on them is feminine and cool. A coworker of mine actually walked by and doubled back to peek his head into my work space to tell me he liked them the first day I wore them.,,KDO46

5,09/14/2016,"I love these shoes! They are extremely comfortable and stylish. I'm usually an 8.5 but in all my running shoes I am an 8, so that is what I purchased in this pair and the fit is perfect! Love the white color although it has a bit of tan in it, just to know as a heads up incase you're really looking for a stark white shoe.",Definitely recommend these shoes! Extremely cute and comfortable!,KDO46
5,09/12/2016,"I love these shoes, they have everything I could ask for style and comfort. Just ordered them in white and plan to order a few more different colors. Scotchguard is a must if you want to keep them clean.",Soooo in love with these,KDO46
5,09/10/2016,"the colour is perfect,a little wide for slim feet.",,KDO46
5,09/07/2016,"no tongue-- so nothing slides and no adjusting. Paid 1/3 less for them than the nikes I usually purchase every season-- and these are aesthetically and physically more impressive. my only con is that the toes feel loose due to the material used. I also usually wear around an 8 but ordered a 7.5 and they are NOT snug, so I believe I can say the sizes must run big.","Better for the price, especially compared to Nike prices.",KDO46
5,09/05/2016,"I love these shoes because they're super comfy while also on trend. I purchased the white/red color which look more tan/off white/red, but I actually like the color more than I did in the picture. They're very versatile and can be paired with jeans, shorts, or athletic gear. I purchased for casual wear but they're so comfy that I plan to make them my go to running shoes",Super comfy!,KDO46

5,08/18/2016,Very classy looking. Extremely comfortable and is a good item in anyones wardrobe.,"Not usually a trainer person, but these are worth every penny",KDO46
5,08/17/2016,I love these shoes so much! I initially ordered 8.5 because I vary between 8 and 8.5 and I read reviews saying to order larger because of the snug fit but I exchanged them for an 8 due to too much room in the toe. The 8 is perfect and I love them so much! So comfortable- they also have great support as I have flat feet! I got the blue and now bought a second pair in the gray. The gray will be for everyday wear and I'll use the blue as my gym shoes!,I hope they never stop selling these!,KDO46

4,08/10/2016,Love the style and comfort - however they were kind of dirty like they had been returned - I didn't expect that getting them directly from Adidas.com ... I emailed customer support but no reply :( but as far as the comfort and style - I highly recommend ...,Comfortable shoe,KDO46

5,08/04/2016,Excellent product really struggled with pain when running and the comfort and support from these trainers have made the world of difference,Great product,KDO46
2,08/02/2016,"I bought these shoes for a comfortable pair of lifestyle shoes, not to work out in by any means. After two weeks of wearing them around the seam around the ankle ripped. These shoes are super comfortable but wish the quality would have been better. A waste of money for a pair of shoes that will not last more than a month.",Disappointing purchase,KDO46
5,07/30/2016,These shoes are great because they're so unique and INCREDIBLY comfortable.,One of my favorite pairs of athletic shoes I've ever purchased,KDO46

4,07/28/2016,"I eyed these shoes in the faded pink color for the longest time, when I finally ordered them I was surprised at how much pinker they actually were. the picture makes it look like a faded color when in reality it is a bright pink. Overall still a very cute shoe.",Color looks different,KDO46
4,07/27/2016,"First time I get Adidas running shoes, Ive always been a Nike shoe freak, these pair of shoes did not disappoint, unfortunately I have 7,5 in Nike and ordered the same in these Adidas and they ended up being too big, so double check your sizing before buying these.",Super nice color and I Love how comfortable They are!!,KDO46

5,07/23/2016,Perfect mix of running shoe with comfort and support and fashion.,Great,KDO46
5,07/19/2016,What attracted me to the sneakers at first were the laces which makes them look sleeker and it doesn't draw attention away from the shoe. Bought these for work and I must say they're pretty comfy for walking long periods of time. They are sock like so I don't know if socks are meant to be worn with them but when I did my feet were slightly hot but not super uncomfortable. I've gotten many compliments on this shoe and the laces in a particular. I would say to size up half a size because while they are meant to feel like a sock they should still fit like a sneaker meaning having a little tiny bit of wiggle room,Cute Buy,KDO46
5,07/18/2016,They are so cushioned and I love the wide straps. Also the way it wraps around the foot gives a perfect supportive fit.,Makes me want to run!!,KDO46
4,07/17/2016,Sooo comfy. Saw them in the store and I just had to get them. I love the look of it. The only thing I'm kind of eh about is how I can see the outline of my feet.. Yikes.,,KDO46
5,07/17/2016,"I love Edge Lux...I have flat feet (no arches) and they fit perfectly. I am on my feet at work all day and at the end of the day, my feet are not painful like they used to be. I have already purchased two pairs and will be ordering more.",Best purchase in a long time,KDO46

5,07/13/2016,it is so comfortable WALKING AND RUNNING SHOE GOOD FOR TRACK,,KDO46
2,07/11/2016,"I received these Edge Luxe Shoes in the Adidas Avenue A subscription box with a few other items. I loved them immediately but put them on for a few hours and they were a bit tight around the base of my foot. I don't usually need a wide but maybe with this pair I do. So, not a big deal but I went to put them on again and realized that rubber on the tip of the shoe is peeling back. Again, I wore these for just a few hours at my desk job and they are falling apart? Not happy with the selection of this box. Especially since the FitU watch isn't accurate in step counting and I've reached out to support several times and received no instructions that have worked or made the tracker work properly. It's been calibrated, I did a hard factory reset and yet I still gain 1000 or more steps while sitting in my car in a two hour commute everyday. I really love Adidas but I am so disappointed with these last few items.",,KDO46
4,07/10/2016,I brought these for my daughter i received them yesterday she love's them. The only thing is I brought white but is more beige so if you'll looking for a all white sneakers don't get these...other then that a great sneakers...ENJOY!!!,,KDO46

4,06/15/2016,I love the pink color! Looks exactly like the picture!,Very cute and comfortable!,KDO46
3,06/12/2016,"I bought this shoe to wear on vacation with lots of walking (not running). I really like the shoe for its general design and comfort. The only thing that is awkward is the lacing. It's hard to lace it in a way that avoids tying a front knot because it's hard to tuck the laces in the shoe. There's no lace hole to insert the laces back through the inside. Instead, you have to tuck the laces over the side of the shoe :/ The site picture shows the laces tucked over the edge as I describe. Visible and awkward.",Could look even more awesome if laces weren't awkward.,KDO46
5,11/29/2017,But i want triple white color for this shoe or cream white,Best shoe,EGA42

5,09/29/2017,"What I thought I was buying was the best pair of blue shoes ever. What I got was the best pair of TEAL shoes ever. It’s not even close. 
As for the shoes, best, most comfortable runners I’ve ever owned. I bought black and red, which are actually black and orange, but at least they are close. The blue isn’t even remotely close.","Great shoes, inaccurate color",EGA42
4,08/21/2017,"I've always preferred Air Max for my runs but after constant nags by my friend over past few months, I finally gave in to the Boost technology. I prefer extra support at the arch, so decided to go with the Ultraboost ST. This is definitely way more comfortable than I had expected. I had read so many reviews saying it feels like walking on the cloud and now I know it wasn't really exaggeration, it does feel like you're walking on the cloud. I have no regrets spending $$$ on this but I do have one complaint. The stitching at end of the tongue (towards the front side) on my right shoe kind of touches the left top of my foot. I don't feel it if I'm wearing a thick sock but it irritates me a bit with my regular/sports socks. Also, I have tried wearing the shoe without socks and I'm 100% sure I'll get a blister if I'm on my foot for a couple of hours in these without a sock. The left side shoe is perfect! And it's not just my foot because I've asked my friend to try it and he felt the same thing. This is not a problem if I'm wearing any sock but for a $190 pair, I expected a better quality control.",Superb in comfort but needs more quality control,EGA42

3,11/14/2017,Ordered it online and it was too big. The fit also looked weird.,It's ok,BEZ75
3,11/05/2017,Unfortunately I had to return these. I think I’d have to try them on in a store. I ordered them in the normal size I usually use for adidas ultra boosts and these felt almost a full size too large. I’ve never had that happen before.

2,10/30/2017,loved the support in the footbed. unfortunately i wore them maybe for 5 workouts and they stretched out so bad i had zero support. the shoe was slipping and sliding so bad that my feet cramped up and my IT band hurt so bad I was unable to run after. extremely disappointing for a $200 pair of running shoes.,runs large,BEZ75

5,08/10/2017,"I absolutely LOVE the Ultra Boost ST. They have a traditional upper, not the stiff / tight sock style that most running shoes now have. They are so comfortable and the boost adds a little oophf. They are hands down my favorite pair of shoes. I just bought another pair because I love the first pair I bought a year ago so much and was worried they wouldn't be available. The color options were meh. I was lucky to have got grey/blue... but as a women, I DON'T want pink and purple and I'm tired of them being the only options or secondary color option (like pops of color).",ULTRA BOOST ST IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME,BEZ75

4,09/19/2017,Perfect but my only problem was the double stitching kind of made the shoe a bit awkward but other than that great job adidas!,These shoes despite not being ultraboosts still perform just as well. Great for running but I would recommend for casual too because of this color way,BEZ99

5,07/30/2017,"Very comfy for both leisure and active wear. Colors are perfect, very stylish. I've received a lot of compliments at work, at the gym, and around town.

3,07/05/2017,"These shoes did not fit very well and I probably could have sized down a half size, which may have alleviated most of my issues. I liked the black boost sole and black and white print.

5,06/19/2017,I'll be one hundred percent honest; that folded tongue was weird at first. I bought a very similar colorway from Finish Line in the pureboost ltd about three months ago. I also own two color ways of the NMD. I sized up by a half size in the pureboosts and I wish I had done the same in the NMDs. I like how comfortable the Pureboosts are. I like the width of the toe box and the snug fit of the upper that still allows for a bit of movement. Those night cargo jawnz are too nice.,"Great feel, great durability.",BEZ99

5,05/14/2017,I bought this product a week ago and have only had it for a day now and I have to say this is my second pair of adidas boost the comfort in the heel is insanity and I expected less for it being painted. The boost has some sort of a glossy finish over it and the burrito style tongue raps around the top of your foot and feels like a sock. there is no insole in these shoes and some people complained about that but in my opinion it is still as comfortable as any shoe with an insole. I love how adidas can show that there boost is comfortable without any sort of insole. It's awesome. Overall after having this shoe for a DAY! I can happily say go a half size up it is a very comfortable shoe and recommend it to everyone no matter the use,Five stars Great Value,BEZ99

5,03/21/2017,"Just got these in the mail today, and I have to say - one of the most comfortable and great looking shoes, comparable to the ultra boosts. I usually wear 9.5 men's UB and I have wide feet, so I went down .5 size for the Pure Boosts and they're perfect. No awkward toe or foot-looking bulges because the PB designed a wider toe-box for running, as it's made for, and it fits like a glove. I'm actually starting to prefer the Pures now because it's slightly (just slightly, like 15% less boost vs Ultras) less cushioning than the Ultras, so it helps for standing at work for 6-8 hours. Exercise wise, I wore them to my Filipino martial arts class where a lot of footwork is involved, and the Pures delivered. Dope shoe, I recommend these 100%",Comfortable and looks great,BEZ99

4,10/28/2017,"I was lucky enough to get my ultra boosts in the size and color I wanted and was very pleased with them until the actual boost mid sole detached from the prime knit upper and also caused a crack/split vertically in the boost. Another somewhat minor problem is the fraying that occurs arond the toe area, but this can be dealt with using a fabric shaver. Overall I really liked the shoe but I was displeased with the incident regarding the separation of sole and upper.","Great shoes, but a few drawbacks.",CBY27
4,10/27/2017,Yeah this product is awesome I recommend them especially if your foot is narrow. This shoe is slightly narrow on my feet personally but the primeknit is stretchy witch evens it out.

5,10/25/2017,"Let me start by saying I haven't owned a pair of Adidas shoes since high school. With that said these shoes are amazing. I've own quite a few of other brands but the comfort in these have left me not wearing any other shoes. The type of comfort is not comparable to any of them. I would put it to feel like a high quality memory foam mattress. They are built very well it seems like (I watched a YouTube video where someone wore them a year and tentatively put 1000 miles on them, they were the V. 1s though) I wear them whenever I'm off work since I have to wear boots at work. If I was to guess I'd say I have put easily 50 miles on them with no sign of wear on the tread. They are getting dirty on the primeknit and the Boost material, but only the primeknit because my wife and I have a 3 month old German Shepherd that love to step on them when we are outside. The fit for me is perfect, some might say they are snug but I like my shoes like that, I ordered my normal size. As they look right now I am willing to say they will last years for me. I have no complaints about these shoes at all and I can't wait to see what newer versions will bring.

4,10/25/2017,"I have been a long time other brand shoe fan, but I loved this shoe since the first time I tried them on. Great fit, feel, comfort, and style, but once I bought  them I realized that the outsole provided little if any traction in the gym or any smooth surface.

I wasn't a huge fan of the look at first (you know the whole styrofoam packing shell thing as the sole), but once I wore them for a day, I just don't even care anymore.

I came from wearing roshes but they were incredibly uncomfortable when wearing for long periods of time, especially when running even a mile. I went for a run immediately after my ultraboosts came in the mail and it made running feel effortless. If you do have a pair of roshes and they fit snug,  you should order a half size up in this shoe. You will have a little toe room but I had to compensate for the width of my foot. Other than that, amazing shoe and 10/10 would buy again.",Just buy it already,CBY27

There is no way to avoid this so you end up with shoes that look dirty right away no matter how careful you are. Otherwise great shoes for lounging or walking. Not for sports but that's ok.

5,09/21/2017,"About five months ago I purchased a pair of Adidas Ultra Boost running shoes. I saw these shoes all over social media and wanted to see what the hype was about. After doing some research, many people claimed these to be the most advanced and the most comfortable running shoes on the market. These shoes were designed for runners but I have seen many people wearing them as a fashionable shoe as well. I bought the triple white Ultra Boosts the summer after my sophomore year in college. I chose these shoes because I love the design of these shoes and I walk a lot in college so I wanted a comfortable shoe. I have discovered through a couple months of wear that durability, comfort, and style of these chose have been better than any other shoe I’ve ever purchased.

Durability
I have worn my white ultra boosts almost everyday since I’ve gotten them. I walk to all my classes in college and my campus is pretty large. Other shoes I have would either wear out on the bottoms, or I would get a hole in the shoe somewhere. Since I have had these shoes they have shown minimal wear. The tread on the bottom is practically new and the upper part of the shoe has no holes or any sort of distress. I believe these shoes will last me for quite some time. 

Comfort
These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. I wear these shoes everyday and walk a lot. Whenever I would have a long walk to class, my feet would usually start hurting. I don’t have that issue anymore with these shoes. The thick “boost” sole of the shoe absorbs each step better than any other shoe I own. Also the sock-like upper material of the shoe is very breathable and flexible. These shoes are so comfortable that sometimes I forget I’m wearing them.

Style
Along with durability and comfort, the new shoes I purchase also have to look good. This Is one of the main reasons I bought these. I love the thick white “boost” foam that runs along the bottom of the shoe. Also, the fact that the laces are separate from the shoe is a great feature that makes these shoes different from the competition. On the back of the shoe, the material comes up a bit higher creating a tab, and although this is a small feature, I think it looks great. In my opinion, the Ultra Boosts are the best looking shoe on the market.

Negatives
After wearing these shoes almost everyday for a few months I have considered these to be the best shoe I have ever purchased. I love almost everything about them, but nothing Is perfect. The sock-like upper material is excellent for comfort and breathability, but not great for any kind of cutting or fast direction changes while running. Also these shoes are priced at a firm $180. This is pretty expensive for a running shoe but I am glad I made the commitment to buying them. Also I got the triple white color way which is pretty hard to keep clean, but that is to be expected when buying all white shoes. 

All in all, these shoes are the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased. They are one of the most sought after shoes in the running and style categories. That being said, the Ultra Boosts live up their hype. Their durability, comfort, and style are better than any other shoes I’ve ever bought. If you walk/run a lot and love a fashionable shoe, I highly recommend getting the Ultra boosts.",Best purchase ever!,CBY27

4,08/22/2017,"I, like most people, was a little skeptical of how a shoe could be priced the way it is. Sure it's an investment, but from the moment I put them on they were the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Although these shoes are super comfortable, I do believe after a long time standing in them they may start to lose their signature comfort ( a little too soft if that makes sense) and also if you have them up tightly they may strain your foot. This however should not scare you from buying the shoe, the investment was very much worth it. The style and supreme comfortability make this my go-to shoe for years to come.",The hype is real,CBY27

3,07/19/2017,Bottom tread wears out after 3months!Unacceptable. My first pair did the same thing. I walk a bunch but these are made for running. Are u running indoors on padded floors because tread will wear away quick on the street. Adidas should offer a warrantee that the continental has to last strong at least 6months. Why wouldn't u just make that thicker?Just because they're comfortable doesn't mean the soul should wear out so fast. And i rotate my sneakers. I'm so heated-adidas and their technology need an upgrade on the souls. Weak craftsmanship. Only have a month return policy-obviously they should last a month!Ridiculous,Poorly made will wear away continental tire in 3 months.

5,02/10/2017,"My Uses for the Adidas Ultraboost Uncaged Shoes:
Currently I use these shoes for running and working out at the gym. I work out in the gym on average one hour and 15 minutes per day, also I generally run roughly 15 miles per week. The sort of conditions that I run on are gravel, asphalt, and grass. Also wear these shoes when going to class for 8+ hours per day.

Comfortability:
For the uses I have stated above the Ultraboost shoes are an easy 5/5 for comfortability. I have tried many different types of running shoes, primarily from Nike and Adidas, but none have been able to apply appropriate support for the differing terrains that I work out on. Though for the Ultraboosts that I recently purchased, even when running on large gravel a sizeable portion of the impact is absorbed. Overall comfortability is the best that I have experienced from any running shoes I have purchased in the past.

Durability:
If you are like me then you tend to go through quite a few pairs of shoes per year. Like with most shoes you will likely try to keep them at least somewhat clean for as long as possible. This will likely require you to wash the shoes more than once. While most other shoes in the past that you have tried washing will begin to wear out after one or two washes the Ultraboosts will still remain looking nearly brand new. I have washed mine 3 times already and they still look almost brand new through all of the mud and other stains that I have gotten on them. Overall durability is outstanding and the new shoe look has lasted the longest with the Ultraboosts.

Support:
For running on uneven ground especially you likely will want plenty of support from your shoes. The arch support that you get with the Ultraboosts is by far the best that I have experienced from other running shoes that I have tried. For ankle support for someone with weaker ankles like myself it is somewhat lacking. This can be corrected just by wearing a light ankle brace and I use one for all of my running shoes anyway. Overall for support I would still consider it one of the top running shoes.

Ending Summary:
Overall if you are looking for a durable, comfortable, and supportive shoe you should really give the Ultraboosts a try. It is a great investment for the average runner and will last you a long time.",Best Running Shoes I have Purchased,KEH54

5,08/16/2016,"I LOVE these shoes. I'm a fitness instructor and I only buy Adidas shoes. I have both the Ultra Boost and Ultra Boost Uncaged for running. The Uncaged has more cushioning on the ball of the foot vs. the 1st gen. Ultra Boost. On the 1st gen. there is a slight forward lean (less forefoot cushioning) that assists with forward propulsion while running. Since the Uncaged has more forefoot cushioning, that forward lean is gone, but I also love the extra cushioning. The 1st gen. is a little more snug in the toe box, where as the Uncaged has just a little bit more room. I love the sock fit at the ankle and the padding inside the heel cup feels amazing. The Continental rubber sole also provides a more noticeable grip on the ground over the 1st gen, but I believe you can get the Continental rubber sole on the 1st gen. also. You can't go wrong with the 1st gen. or the Uncaged. Both are amazing. I personally own 2 pair (1st gen & Uncaged), I have bought my fiance 2 pair (both 1st gen) and I recently bought my 15 year old daughter a pair (1st gen). She started band camp and was using a different pair of running shoes that left her with blisters on her toes after marching for 5 hours.

3,07/12/2016,The shoes overall look great but when I wore them without socks the back part starting making A blister on the back is my foot. I think the tab comes up too high. At times the fabric feels too tight around my foot so much so that it tingles. Other than that the shoes are super comfortable to walk in. I'm hoping that by wearing socks I'll eliminate the blister issue and that the shoes will stretch out just a bit.,,KEH54

3,07/11/2016,"Everything you can ask for in a UB, sock-like feel and no cage tightness for us wide footers. However, if you plan on actually wearing these for running beware of the back stitch at the ankle opening.  After running for about a mile, you can start to really feel it rubbing on the Achilles. Changed to a higher sock and you won't notice it but the fact that I have to adjust my sock preference for a $180+ shoe is not what I wanted. That one stitch is what bothers me the most so unless you wear socks with heel tabs or plan to put band aids at the back then these are good to go.  But I will be returning these since I use UB ST and the adizero prime for most runs and I don't need another ""casual"" UB since I have the 1st generation on rotation.",Must wear higher socks for that Saw-like stitch.,KEH54

5,07/10/2016,"The ultra boost uncaged absolutely surpassed all my expectations in comfort, fit, support and style! The sock like fit was perfect and held the shoe in place without any uncomfortable rubbing at the heel, which I found with my Tubular Virals/

I could walk, run and train for days on the ultra boost sole - lightweight, bouncy and responsive. The slight curved geometry lends perfectly to my natural stride and helps cushion impact on runs.

As for style, the core black colourway is a hard one to beat. Coordinates with anything and everything, but I particularly love the gold lace tips for detail.

If there's any stock left, definitely buy a pair. If not, I feel for you.",Best ultra boosts ever,KEH54

3,07/05/2016,"Go with the original. The NMD-like sock cuff isn't very comfortable and the implementation (design, placement) of the three stripes is pretty awful. Why impose these new ""features"" when people were already clamoring for the uncaged approach they loved in all the collaborations? I will say the inner support is fantastically clever but since more people generally (and sneakerheads specifically) would be interested in this as a lifestyle shoe based on established uncaged aesthetics, why mess with it? The stripes just look so lame. I sent my black pair back immediately.",Sock cuff not great; stripes design = disaster,KEH54
5,07/02/2016,these shoes are amazing. So happy with my purchase. So comfortable and look amazing. Only things for me are they are a bit wide at the feet and looked a little blue when i received them.

4,10/20/2017,"This is a great shoe. I think the comfort and whole shoe dynamic is a step down for me compared to the pure boost 3. If I could but more of the 3s, I would do that. The exclusion of an insole left me to buy my own separately and is a disappointment. This is the first time a burrito tongue has worked for me. I wish Adidas would make this in pure black with no color texture, for work. 
These have the same outsoles as the non atr pure boost models. So I'm not sure why they call them atr and not all weather. 
Overall, a comfortable shoe that's better than all other brands because of boost.",Pure boost 3 was better,CCX10
4,10/17/2017,I like the shoe but where is the insole? I think it's kind of cheap to make such an expensive shoe and have the wearer feel the tracks on the inside of the shoe.  I feel the older model of pureboost was better than this.,Very nice shoe- where is insole?,CCX10

So I finally bit the bullet because I figured since we will be going to Vegas to attend the SEMA Show since we usually walk about 30 miles or so over a 3 day span. When I first tried them on, I must say that my feet have never felt like they were on clouds before. The support and comfort is nothing like I've ever experienced before! Yes they may on the more pricey side but it's so worth! The colors are just too cute and you can basically wear it with anything. I'm already looking into purchasing my next pair!

I noticed a hole in the top of the shoe fabric  last night.
